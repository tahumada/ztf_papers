Never bet against Einstein;;Among the geniuses of mankind, Einstein was probably one of those who made more erroneous claims, and often changed his opinion during the years on important scientific subjects. However, it is important to bear in mind that his mistakes were always due to a misinterpretation of the results obtained from his equations, since he was often biased by his own view of the universe. Einstein’s equations have always given the correct answer and, till now, more than a century after its development, there is no evidence that it may not be correct.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022IJMPD..3140014D
The science case for LIGO-India;;The global network of gravitational-wave detectors has completed three observing runs with ~50 detections of merging compact binaries. A third LIGO detector, with comparable astrophysical reach, is to be built in India (LIGO-Aundha) and expected to be operational during the latter part of this decade. Such additions to the network increase the number of baselines and the network SNR of GW events. These enhancements help improve the sky-localization of those events. Multiple detectors simultaneously in operation will also increase the baseline duty factor, thereby, leading to an improvement in the detection rates and, hence, the completeness of surveys. In this paper, we quantify the improvements due to the expansion of the LIGO global network in the precision with which source properties will be measured. We also present examples of how this expansion will give a boost to tests of fundamental physics.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022CQGra..39b5004S
Mid-infrared Outbursts in Nearby Galaxies (MIRONG). II. Optical Spectroscopic Follow-up;;Infrared echo has proven to be an effective means to discover transient accretion events of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), such as tidal disruption events (TDEs) and changing-look active galactic nuclei (AGNs), in dusty circumnuclear environments. To explore the dusty populations of SMBH transient events, we have constructed a large sample of mid-infrared outbursts in nearby galaxies (MIRONG) and performed multiwavelength observations. Here we present the results of multiepoch spectroscopic follow-up observations of a subsample of 54 objects spanning a timescale of 4 yr. Emission-line variability was detected in 22 of them with either emergence or enhancement of broad Balmer emission lines in comparison with pre-outburst spectra. Coronal lines, He II λ4686, and Bowen line N III λ4640 appeared in the spectra of nine, seven, and two sources, respectively. These results suggest that MIRONG is a mixed bag of different transient sources. We have tentatively classified them into different subclass according to their spectral evolution and light curves. Two sources have been in a steady high broad Hα flux up to the latest observation and might be turn-on AGNs. Broad lines faded out in the remaining sources, indicating a transient ionizing source ignited by TDE or sporadic gas accretion. Thirty-one sources do not show noticeable spectral change with respect to their pre-outburst spectra. They have a statistically redder MIR color and lower MIR luminosity of the outbursts, which are consistent with heavily obscured events.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..258...21W
The Milky Way Revealed by Variable Stars. I. Sample Selection of RR Lyrae Stars and Evidence for Merger History;;In order to study the Milky Way, RR Lyrae (RRL) variable stars identified by Gaia, ASAS-SN, and ZTF sky survey projects have been analyzed as tracers in this work. Photometric and spectroscopic information of 3417 RRLs including proper motions, radial velocity, and metallcity are obtained from observational data of Gaia, LAMOST, GALAH, APOGEE, and RAVE. Precise distances of RRLs with typical uncertainties less than 3% are derived by using a recent comprehensive period-luminosity-metallicity relation. Our results from kinematical and chemical analysis provide important clues for the assembly history of the Milky Way, especially for the Gaia-Sausage ancient merger. The kinematical and chemical trends found in this work are consistent with those of recent simulations that indicated that the Gaia-Sausage merger had a dual origin in the Galactic thick disk and halo. As recent similar works have found, the halo RRL sample in this work contains a subset of radially biased orbits besides a more isotropic component. This higher orbital anisotropy component amounts to β ≃ 0.8, and it contributes between 42% and 83% of the halo RRLs at 4 < R( kpc) < 20.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..258...20A
TESS Eclipsing Binary Stars. I. Short-cadence Observations of 4584 Eclipsing Binaries in Sectors 1-26;;In this paper we present a catalog of 4584 eclipsing binaries observed during the first two years (26 sectors) of the TESS survey. We discuss selection criteria for eclipsing binary candidates, detection of hitherto unknown eclipsing systems, determination of the ephemerides, the validation and triage process, and the derivation of heuristic estimates for the ephemerides. Instead of keeping to the widely used discrete classes, we propose a binary star morphology classification based on a dimensionality reduction algorithm. Finally, we present statistical properties of the sample, we qualitatively estimate completeness, and we discuss the results. The work presented here is organized and performed within the TESS Eclipsing Binary Working Group, an open group of professional and citizen scientists; we conclude by describing ongoing work and future goals for the group. The catalog is available from http://tessEBs.villanova.edu and from MAST.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..258...16P
Give Me a Few Hours: Exploring Short Timescales in Rubin Observatory Cadence Simulations;;The limiting temporal resolution of a time-domain survey in detecting transient behavior is set by the time between observations of the same sky area. We analyze the distribution of visit separations for a range of Vera C. Rubin Observatory cadence simulations. Simulations from families v1.5-v1.7.1 are strongly peaked at the 22 minute visit pair separation and provide effectively no constraint on temporal evolution within the night. This choice will necessarily prevent Rubin from discovering a wide range of astrophysical phenomena in time to trigger rapid follow-up. We present a science-agnostic metric to supplement detailed simulations of fast-evolving transients and variables and suggest potential approaches for improving the range of timescales explored.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..258...13B
Optimizing Cadences with Realistic Light-curve Filtering for Serendipitous Kilonova Discovery with Vera Rubin Observatory;;Current and future optical and near-infrared wide-field surveys have the potential to find kilonovae, the optical and infrared counterparts to neutron star mergers, independently of gravitational-wave or high-energy gamma-ray burst triggers. The ability to discover fast and faint transients such as kilonovae largely depends on the area observed, the depth of those observations, the number of revisits per field in a given time frame, and the filters adopted by the survey; it also depends on the ability to perform rapid follow-up observations to confirm the nature of the transients. In this work, we assess kilonova detectability in existing simulations of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time strategy for the Vera C. Rubin Wide Fast Deep survey, with focus on comparing rolling to baseline cadences. Although currently available cadences can enable the detection of >300 kilonovae out to ~1400 Mpc over the 10 year survey, we can expect only 3-32 kilonovae similar to GW170817 to be recognizable as fast-evolving transients. We also explore the detectability of kilonovae over the plausible parameter space, focusing on viewing angle and ejecta masses. We find that observations in redder izy bands are crucial for identification of nearby (within 300 Mpc) kilonovae that could be spectroscopically classified more easily than more distant sources. Rubin's potential for serendipitous kilonova discovery could be increased by gain of efficiency with the employment of individual 30 s exposures (as opposed to 2 × 15 s snap pairs), with the addition of red-band observations coupled with same-night observations in g or r bands, and possibly with further development of a new rolling-cadence strategy.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..258....5A
Near-Chandrasekhar-mass Type Ia Supernovae from the Double-degenerate Channel;;Recent observational evidence has demonstrated that white dwarf (WD) mergers are a highly efficient mechanism for mass accretion onto WDs in the galaxy. In this paper, we show that WD mergers naturally produce highly magnetized, uniformly rotating WDs, including a substantial population within a narrow mass range close to the Chandrasekhar mass (M <SUB>Ch</SUB>). These near-M <SUB>Ch</SUB> WD mergers subsequently undergo rapid spin up and compression on a ~ 10<SUP>2</SUP> yr timescale, either leading to central ignition and a normal SN Ia via the DDT mechanism, or alternatively to a failed detonation and SN Iax through pure deflagration. The resulting SNe Ia and SNe Iax will have spectra, light curves, polarimetry, and nucleosynthetic yields similar to those predicted to arise through the canonical near-M <SUB>Ch</SUB> single degenerate (SD) channel, but with a t <SUP>-1</SUP> delay time distribution characteristic of the double-degenerate channel. Furthermore, in contrast to the SD channel, WD merger near-M <SUB>Ch</SUB> SNe Ia and SNe Iax will not produce observable companion signatures. We discuss a range of implications of these findings, from SNe Ia explosion mechanisms, to galactic nucleosynthesis of iron peak elements including manganese.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925...92N
Formation of the Double White Dwarf Binary PTF J0533+0209 through Stable Mass Transfer?;;Double white dwarf (DWD) binaries are important for studies of common-envelope (CE) evolution, Type Ia supernova progenitors and Galactic sources of low-frequency gravitational waves. PTF J0533+0209 is a DWD system with a short orbital period of P <SUB>orb</SUB> ~ 20 minutes and thus a so-called LISA verification source. The formation of this system and other DWDs is still under debate. In this paper, we discuss the possible formation scenarios of this binary and argue that it is not likely to have formed through CE evolution. Applying a new magnetic-braking prescription, we use the MESA code to model the formation of this system through stable mass transfer. We find a model that can well reproduce the observed WD masses and orbital period but not the effective temperature and hydrogen abundance of the low-mass He WD component. We discuss the possibility of using H flashes to mitigate this discrepancy. Finally, we discuss the future evolution of this system into an AM CVn binary such as those that will be detected by spaceborne GW observatories like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925...89C
The UV/Optical Peak and X-Ray Brightening in TDE Candidate AT 2019azh: A Case of Stream-Stream Collision and Delayed Accretion;;We present and analyze the optical/UV and X-ray observations of a nearby tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate, AT 2019azh, from ~30 days before to ~400 days after its early optical peak. The X-rays show a late brightening by a factor of ~30-100 around 200 days after discovery, while the UV/opticals continuously decayed. The early X-rays show two flaring episodes of variation, temporally uncorrelated with the early UV/opticals. We found a clear sign of X-ray hardness evolution; i.e., the source is harder at early times and becomes softer as it brightens later. The drastically different temporal behaviors in X-rays and UV/opticals suggest that the two bands are physically distinct emission components and probably arise from different locations. These properties argue against the reprocessing of X-rays by any outflow as the origin of the UV/optical peak. The full data are best explained by a two-process scenario, in which the UV/optical peak is produced by the debris stream-stream collisions during the circularization phase; some shocked gas with low angular momentum forms an early, low-mass "precursor" accretion disk that emits the early X-rays. The major body of the disk is formed after the circularization finishes, whose enhanced accretion rate produces the late X-ray brightening. Event AT 2019azh is a strong case of a TDE whose emission signatures of stream-stream collision and delayed accretion are both identified.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925...67L
Inferring Kilonova Population Properties with a Hierarchical Bayesian Framework. I. Nondetection Methodology and Single-event Analyses;;We present nimbus: a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer the intrinsic luminosity parameters of kilonovae (KNe) associated with gravitational-wave (GW) events, based purely on nondetections. This framework makes use of GW 3D distance information and electromagnetic upper limits from multiple surveys for multiple events and self-consistently accounts for the finite sky coverage and probability of astrophysical origin. The framework is agnostic to the brightness evolution assumed and can account for multiple electromagnetic passbands simultaneously. Our analyses highlight the importance of accounting for model selection effects, especially in the context of nondetections. We show our methodology using a simple, two-parameter linear brightness model, taking the follow-up of GW190425 with the Zwicky Transient Facility as a single-event test case for two different prior choices of model parameters: (i) uniform/uninformative priors and (ii) astrophysical priors based on surrogate models of Monte Carlo radiative-transfer simulations of KNe. We present results under the assumption that the KN is within the searched region to demonstrate functionality and the importance of prior choice. Our results show consistency with simsurvey-an astronomical survey simulation tool used previously in the literature to constrain the population of KNe. While our results based on uniform priors strongly constrain the parameter space, those based on astrophysical priors are largely uninformative, highlighting the need for deeper constraints. Future studies with multiple events having electromagnetic follow-up from multiple surveys should make it possible to constrain the KN population further.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925...58M
Follow-up Observations of the Prolonged, Super-Eddington, Tidal Disruption Event Candidate 3XMM J150052.0+015452: the Slow Decline Continues;;The X-ray source 3XMM J150052.0+015452 was discovered as a spectacular tidal disruption event candidate during a prolonged (>11 yr) outburst. It exhibited unique quasi-soft X-ray spectra of characteristic temperature kT ~ 0.3 keV for several years at the peak, but in a recent Chandra observation (10 yr into the outburst) a super-soft X-ray spectrum of kT ~ 0.15 keV was detected. Such dramatic spectral softening could signal the transition from the super-Eddington to thermal state or the temporary presence of a warm absorber. Here we report on our study of four new XMM-Newton follow-up observations of the source. We found that they all showed super-soft spectra, suggesting that the source had remained super-soft for >5 yr. Then its spectral change is best explained as due to the super-Eddington to thermal spectral state transition. The fits to the thermal-state spectra suggested a smaller absorption toward the source than that obtained in Lin et al. This led us to update the modeling of the event as due to the disruption of a 0.75 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> star by a massive black hole of a few × 10<SUP>5</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. We also obtained two HST images in the F606W and F814W filters and found that the dwarf star-forming host galaxy can be resolved into a dominant disk and a smaller bulge. No central point source was clearly seen in either filter, ruling out strong optical emission associated with the X-ray activity.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...924L..35L
Impact of the SpaceX Starlink Satellites on the Zwicky Transient Facility Survey Observations;;There is a growing concern about an impact of low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite constellations on ground-based astronomical observations, in particular, on wide-field surveys in the optical and infrared. The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), thanks to the large field of view of its camera, provides an ideal setup to study the effects of LEO megaconstellations-such as SpaceX's Starlink-on astronomical surveys. Here, we analyze the archival ZTF observations collected between 2019 November and 2021 September and find 5301 satellite streaks that can be attributed to Starlink satellites. We find that the number of affected images is increasing with time as SpaceX deploys more satellites. Twilight observations are particularly affected-a fraction of streaked images taken during twilight has increased from less than 0.5% in late 2019 to 18% in 2021 August. We estimate that once the size of the Starlink constellation reaches 10,000, essentially all ZTF images taken during twilight may be affected. However, despite the increase in satellite streaks observed during the analyzed period, the current science operations of ZTF are not yet strongly affected. We also find that redesigning Starlink satellites (by installing visors intended to block sunlight from reaching the satellite antennas to prevent reflection) reduces their brightness by a factor of 4.6 ± 0.1 with respect to the original design in g, r, and i bands.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...924L..30M
Types of Transients in the Centers of Post-starburst and Quiescent Balmer-strong Galaxies;;Tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been found to show a preference for post-starburst (PS) and quiescent Balmer-strong (QBS) galaxies. This preference can be used to help find TDEs in transient surveys. But what other transients might "contaminate" such a search, and by how much? We examine all reported transients coincident with the centers of galaxies in the French & Zabludoff (2018) catalog of spectroscopically confirmed PS and QBS galaxies and photometrically identified PS and QBS galaxy candidates. We find that TDEs and Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are the only types of transients classified in the centers of these galaxies (aside from one active galactic nucleus flare), with Type Ia SNe being 8.3 ± 0.2 times more prevalent than TDEs (1σ confidence bounds). This factor is ~2.7 times lower than in a control sample of quiescent galaxies. Narrowing the sample to spectroscopically confirmed QBS galaxies does not change these statistics much. In spectroscopically confirmed PS galaxies, however, TDEs are the ones that outnumber Type Ia SNe 2 ± 0.6 to 1. Unfortunately, there are few such galaxies in the catalog. By classifying transients from the entire catalog, three times more TDEs are expected to be found, but with a ~16 times larger Type Ia SN contamination. We use the public ZTF photometric archive to search for possibly missed TDEs in the French & Zabludoff (2018) galaxies. We find three unclassified clear transients-none of which are likely missed TDEs based on their light-curve colors.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...924..121A
A Detailed Analysis of GW190521 with Phenomenological Waveform Models;;In this paper we present an extensive analysis of the GW190521 gravitational wave event with the current (fourth) generation of phenomenological waveform models for binary black hole coalescences. GW190521 stands out from other events since only a few wave cycles are observable. This leads to a number of challenges, one being that such short signals are prone to not resolving approximate waveform degeneracies, which may result in multimodal posterior distributions. The family of waveform models we use includes a new fast time-domain model (IMRPHENOMTPHM), which allows us to extensively test different priors and robustness with respect to variations in the waveform model, including the content of spherical harmonic modes. We clarify some issues raised in a recent paper, Nitz & Capano, associated with possible support for a high-mass-ratio source, but confirm their finding of a multimodal posterior distribution, albeit with important differences in the statistical significance of the peaks. In particular, we find that the support for both masses being outside the pair instability supernova mass gap, and the support for an intermediate-mass-ratio binary are drastically reduced with respect to what Nitz & Capano found. We also provide updated probabilities for associating GW190521 to the potential electromagnetic counterpart from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Graham et al.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...924...79E
An Early-time Optical and Ultraviolet Excess in the Type-Ic SN 2020oi;;We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of Supernova 2020oi (SN 2020oi), a nearby (~17 Mpc) type-Ic supernova (SN Ic) within the grand-design spiral M100. We undertake a comprehensive analysis to characterize the evolution of SN 2020oi and constrain its progenitor system. We detect flux in excess of the fireball rise model δ t ≈ 2.5 days from the date of explosion in multiband optical and UV photometry from the Las Cumbres Observatory and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, respectively. The derived SN bolometric luminosity is consistent with an explosion with M <SUB>ej</SUB> = 0.81 ± 0.03 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, E <SUB> k </SUB> = 0.79 ± 0.09 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, and M <SUB>Ni56</SUB> = 0.08 ± 0.02 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Inspection of the event's decline reveals the highest Δm <SUB>15,bol</SUB> reported for a stripped-envelope event to date. Modeling of optical spectra near event peak indicates a partially mixed ejecta comparable in composition to the ejecta observed in SN 1994I, while the earliest spectrum shows signatures of a possible interaction with material of a distinct composition surrounding the SN progenitor. Further, Hubble Space Telescope pre-explosion imaging reveals a stellar cluster coincident with the event. From the cluster photometry, we derive the mass and age of the SN progenitor using stellar evolution models implemented in the BPASS library. Our results indicate that SN 2020oi occurred in a binary system from a progenitor of mass M <SUB>ZAMS</SUB> ≈ 9.5 ± 1.0 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, corresponding to an age of 27 ± 7 Myr. SN 2020oi is the dimmest SN Ic event to date for which an early-time flux excess has been observed, and the first in which an early excess is unlikely to be associated with shock cooling.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...924...55G
Data-driven Expectations for Electromagnetic Counterpart Searches Based on LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts;;Searches for electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational-wave signals have redoubled since the first detection in 2017 of a binary neutron star merger with a gamma-ray burst, optical/infrared kilonova, and panchromatic afterglow. Yet, one LIGO/Virgo observing run later, there has not yet been a second, secure identification of an electromagnetic counterpart. This is not surprising given that the localization uncertainties of events in LIGO and Virgo's third observing run, O3, were much larger than predicted. We explain this by showing that improvements in data analysis that now allow LIGO/Virgo to detect weaker and hence more poorly localized events have increased the overall number of detections, of which well-localized, gold-plated events make up a smaller proportion overall. We present simulations of the next two LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing runs, O4 and O5, that are grounded in the statistics of O3 public alerts. To illustrate the significant impact that the updated predictions can have, we study the follow-up strategy for the Zwicky Transient Facility. Realistic and timely forecasting of gravitational-wave localization accuracy is paramount given the large commitments of telescope time and the need to prioritize which events are followed up. We include a data release of our simulated localizations as a public proposal planning resource for astronomers.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...924...54P
Final Moments. I. Precursor Emission, Envelope Inflation, and Enhanced Mass Loss Preceding the Luminous Type II Supernova 2020tlf;;We present panchromatic observations and modeling of supernova (SN) 2020tlf, the first normal Type II-P/L SN with confirmed precursor emission, as detected by the Young Supernova Experiment transient survey. Pre-SN activity was detected in riz-bands at -130 days and persisted at relatively constant flux until first light. Soon after discovery, "flash" spectroscopy of SN 2020tlf revealed narrow, symmetric emission lines that resulted from the photoionization of circumstellar material (CSM) shed in progenitor mass-loss episodes before explosion. Surprisingly, this novel display of pre-SN emission and associated mass loss occurred in a red supergiant (RSG) progenitor with zero-age main-sequence mass of only 10-12 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, as inferred from nebular spectra. Modeling of the light curve and multi-epoch spectra with the non-LTE radiative-transfer code CMFGEN and radiation-hydrodynamical code HERACLES suggests a dense CSM limited to r ≈ 10<SUP>15</SUP> cm, and mass-loss rate of 10<SUP>-2</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The luminous light-curve plateau and persistent blue excess indicates an extended progenitor, compatible with an RSG model with R <SUB>⋆</SUB> = 1100 R <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Limits on the shock-powered X-ray and radio luminosity are consistent with model conclusions and suggest a CSM density of ρ < 2 × 10<SUP>-16</SUP> g cm<SUP>-3</SUP> for distances from the progenitor star of r ≈ 5 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> cm, as well as a mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} 1.3\times {10}^{-5}\,{M}_{\odot }\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$ at larger distances. A promising power source for the observed precursor emission is the ejection of stellar material following energy disposition into the stellar envelope as a result of gravity waves emitted during either neon/oxygen burning or a nuclear flash from silicon combustion.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...924...15J
The Hubble Constant from Strongly Lensed Supernovae with Standardizable Magnifications;;The dominant uncertainty in the current measurement of the Hubble constant (H <SUB>0</SUB>) with strong gravitational lensing time delays is attributed to uncertainties in the mass profiles of the main deflector galaxies. Strongly lensed supernovae (glSNe) can provide, in addition to measurable time delays, lensing magnification constraints when knowledge about the unlensed apparent brightness of the explosion is imposed. We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework to combine a data set of SNe that are not strongly lensed and a data set of strongly lensed SNe with measured time delays. We jointly constrain (i) H <SUB>0</SUB> using the time delays as an absolute distance indicator, (ii) the lens model profiles using the magnification ratio of lensed and unlensed fluxes on the population level, and (iii) the unlensed apparent magnitude distribution of the SN population and the redshift-luminosity relation of the relative expansion history of the universe. We apply our joint inference framework on a future expected data set of glSNe and forecast that a sample of 144 glSNe of Type Ia with well-measured time series and imaging data will measure H <SUB>0</SUB> to 1.5%. We discuss strategies to mitigate systematics associated with using absolute flux measurements of glSNe to constrain the mass density profiles. Using the magnification of SN images is a promising and complementary alternative to using stellar kinematics. Future surveys, such as the Rubin and Roman observatories, will be able to discover the necessary number of glSNe, and with additional follow-up observations, this methodology will provide precise constraints on mass profiles and H <SUB>0</SUB>.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...924....2B
Characterizing Sparse Asteroid Light Curves with Gaussian Processes;;In the era of wide-field surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, sparse photometric measurements constitute an increasing percentage of asteroid observations, particularly for asteroids newly discovered in these large surveys. Follow-up observations to supplement these sparse data may be prohibitively expensive in many cases, so to overcome these sampling limitations, we introduce a flexible model based on Gaussian processes to enable Bayesian parameter inference of asteroid time-series data. This model is designed to be flexible and extensible, and can model multiple asteroid properties such as the rotation period, light-curve amplitude, changing pulse profile, and magnitude changes due to the phase-angle evolution at the same time. Here, we focus on the inference of rotation periods. Based on both simulated light curves and real observations from the Zwicky Transient Facility, we show that the new model reliably infers rotational periods from sparsely sampled light curves and generally provides well-constrained posterior probability densities for the model parameters. We propose this framework as an intermediate method between fast but very limited-period detection algorithms and much more comprehensive but computationally expensive shape-modeling based on ray-tracing codes.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163...29L
Identify Light-curve Signals with Deep Learning Based Object Detection Algorithm. I. Transit Detection;;Deep learning techniques have been well explored in the transiting exoplanet field; however, previous work mainly focuses on classification and inspection. In this work, we develop a novel detection algorithm based on a well-proven object detection framework in the computer vision field. Through training the network on the light curves of the confirmed Kepler exoplanets, our model yields about 90% precision and recall for identifying transits with signal-to-noise ratio higher than 6 (set the confidence threshold to 0.6). Giving a slightly lower confidence threshold, recall can reach higher than 95%. We also transfer the trained model to the TESS data and obtain similar performance. The results of our algorithm match the intuition of the human visual perception and make it useful to find single-transiting candidates. Moreover, the parameters of the output bounding boxes can also help to find multiplanet systems. Our network and detection functions are implemented in the Deep-Transit toolkit, which is an open-source Python package hosted on Github and PyPI.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163...23C
GPU-enabled searches for periodic signals of unknown shape;;Recent and future generation observatories will enable the study of variable astronomical phenomena through their time-domain capabilities. High temporal fidelity will allow for unprecedented investigations into the nature of variable objects - those objects that vary in brightness over time. A major bottleneck in data processing pipelines is constructing light curve solutions for catalogs of variable objects, as it is well-known that period finding algorithms are computationally expensive. Furthermore, there are many period finding algorithms that are often suited for specific science cases. In this paper, we present the first GPU-accelerated Super Smoother algorithm. Super Smoother is general purpose and uses cross-validation to fit line segments to a time series, and as such, is more computationally expensive than other algorithms, such as Lomb-Scargle. Because the algorithm requires making several scans over the input time series for a tested frequency, we also propose a novel generalized-validation variant of Super Smoother that only requires a single scan over the data. We compare the performance of our algorithms to analogous parallel multi-core CPU implementations on three catalogs of data, and show that it is generally advantageous to use the GPU algorithm over the CPU counterparts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our single-pass variant of Super Smoother is roughly equally as accurate at finding correct period solutions as the original algorithm. Our software supports several features, such as batching the computation to eliminate the possibility of exceeding global memory on the GPU, processing a single object or batches of objects, and we allow for scaling the algorithm across multiple GPUs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&C....3800511G
Maximum luminosities of normal stripped-envelope supernovae are brighter than explosion models allow;;Context. Stripped-envelope supernovae (SE SNe) of Type Ib and Type Ic are thought to be the result of explosions of massive stars that have lost their outer envelopes. The favored explosion mechanism is via core-collapse, with the shock later revived by neutrino heating. However, there is an upper limit to the amount of radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni that such models can accommodate. Recent studies in the literature point to a tension between the maximum luminosity from such simulations and the observations. 
 Aims: We used a well-characterized sample of SE SNe from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey (BTS) to scrutinize the observational caveats regarding estimates of the maximum luminosity (and thus the amount of ejected radioactive nickel) for the sample members. 
 Methods: We employed the strict selection criteria for the BTS to collect a sample of spectroscopically classified normal Type Ibc SNe, for which we used the ZTF light curves to determine the maximum luminosity. We culled the sample further based on data quality, shape of the light curves, distances, and colors. Then we examined the uncertainties that may affect the measurements. The methodology of the sample construction based on this BTS sample can be used for other future investigations. 
 Results: We analyzed the observational data, consisting of optical light curves and spectra, for the selected sub-samples. In total, we used 129 Type Ib or Type Ic BTS SNe with an initial rough luminosity distribution peaking at M<SUB>r</SUB> = −17.61 ± 0.72, and where 36% are apparently brighter than the theoretically predicted maximum brightness of M<SUB>r</SUB> = −17.8. When we further culled this sample to ensure that the SNe are normal Type Ibc with good LC data within the Hubble flow, the sample of 94 objects gives M<SUB>r</SUB> = −17.64 ± 0.54. A main uncertainty in absolute magnitude determinations for SNe is the host galaxy extinction correction, but the reddened objects only get more luminous after corrections. If we simply exclude red objects, or those with unusual or uncertain colors, then we are left with 14 objects at M<SUB>r</SUB> = −17.90 ± 0.73, whereof a handful are most certainly brighter than the suggested theoretical limit. The main result of this study is thus that normal SNe Ibc do indeed reach luminosities above 10<SUP>42.6</SUP> erg s<SUP>−1</SUP>, which is apparently in conflict with existing explosion models.

The Gravitational-wave physics II: Progress;;It has been a half-decade since the first direct detection of gravitational waves, which signifies the coming of the era of the gravitational-wave astronomy and gravitational-wave cosmology. The increasing number of the detected gravitational-wave events has revealed the promising capability of constraining various aspects of cosmology, astronomy, and gravity. Due to the limited space in this review article, we will briefly summarize the recent progress over the past five years, but with a special focus on some of our own work for the Key Project "Physics associated with the gravitational waves" supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China. In particular, (1) we have presented the mechanism of the gravitational-wave production during some physical processes of the early Universe, such as inflation, preheating and phase transition, and the cosmological implications of gravitational-wave measurements; (2) we have put constraints on the neutron star maximum mass according to GW170817 observations; (3) we have developed a numerical relativity algorithm based on the finite element method and a waveform model for the binary black hole coalescence along an eccentric orbit.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021SCPMA..6420401B
LAMOST Time-Domain survey: first results of four K2 plates;;From Oct. 2019 to Apr. 2020, LAMOST performed a time-domain (TD) spectroscopic survey of four K2 plates with both low- and medium-resolution observations. The low-resolution spectroscopic survey acquired 282 exposures ( ≈ 46.6 h) over 25 nights, yielding a total of about 767 000 spectra, and the medium-resolution survey took 177 exposures ( ≈ 49.1 h) over 27 nights, collecting about 478 000 spectra. More than 70%/50% of low-resolution/medium-resolution spectra have signal-to-noise ratio higher than 10. We determine stellar parameters (e.g., T <SUB>eff</SUB>, log g, [Fe/H]) and radial velocity (RV) with different methods, including LASP, DD-Payne and SLAM. In general, these parameter estimations from different methods show good agreement, and the stellar parameter values are consistent with those of APOGEE. We use the Gaia DR2 RV values to calculate a median RV zero point (RVZP) for each spectrograph exposure by exposure, and the RVZP-corrected RVs agree well with the APOGEE data. The stellar evolutionary and spectroscopic masses are estimated based on the stellar parameters, multi-band magnitudes, distances and extinction values. Finally, we construct a binary catalog including about 2700 candidates by analyzing their light curves, fitting the RV data, calculating the binarity parameters from medium-resolution spectra and cross-matching the spatially resolved binary catalog from Gaia EDR3. The LAMOST TD survey is expected to represent a breakthrough in various scientific topics, such as binary systems, stellar activity, stellar pulsation, etc.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021RAA....21..292W

A method for finding anomalous astronomical light curves and their analogues;;Our understanding of the Universe has profited from deliberate targeted studies of known phenomena, as well as from serendipitous unexpected discoveries, such as the discovery of a complex variability pattern in the direction of KIC 8462852 (Boyajian's star). Upcoming surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time will explore the parameter space of astrophysical transients at all time-scales, and offer the opportunity to discover even more extreme examples of unexpected phenomena. We investigate strategies to identify novel objects and to contextualize them within large time-series data sets in order to facilitate the discovery of new classes of objects as well as the physical interpretation of their anomalous nature. We develop a method that combines tree-based and manifold-learning algorithms for anomaly detection in order to perform two tasks: 1) identify and rank anomalous objects in a time-domain data set; and 2) group those anomalies according to their similarity in order to identify analogues. We achieve the latter by combining an anomaly score from a tree-based method with a dimensionality manifold-learning reduction strategy. Clustering in the reduced space allows for the successful identification of anomalies and analogues. We also assess the impact of pre-processing and feature engineering schemes and investigate the astrophysical nature of the objects that our models identify as anomalous by augmenting the Kepler data with Gaia colour and luminosity information. We find that multiple models, used in combination, are a promising strategy to identify novel light curves and light curve families.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.5734M
Accretion of tidally disrupted asteroids on to white dwarfs: direct accretion versus disc processing;;Atmospheric heavy elements have been observed in more than a quarter of white dwarfs (WDs) at different cooling ages, indicating ongoing accretion of asteroidal material, whilst only a few per cent of the WDs possess a dust disc, and all these WDs are accreting metals. Here, assuming that a rubble-pile asteroid is scattered inside a WD's Roche lobe by a planet, we study its tidal disruption and the long-term evolution of the resulting fragments. We find that after a few pericentric passages, the asteroid is shredded into its constituent particles, forming a flat, thin ring. On a time-scale of Myr, tens of per cent of the particles are scattered on to the WD, and are therefore directly accreted without first passing through a circularized close-in disc. Fragment mutual collisions are most effective for coplanar fragments, and are thus only important in 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> yr before the orbital coplanarity is broken by the planet. We show that for a rubble pile asteroid with a size frequency distribution of the component particles following that of the near earth objects, it has to be roughly at least 10 km in radius such that enough fragments are generated and $\ge 10{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of its mass is lost to mutual collisions. At relative velocities of tens of km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, such collisions grind down the tidal fragments into smaller and smaller dust grains. The WD radiation forces may shrink those grains' orbits, forming a dust disc. Tidal disruption of a monolithic asteroid creates large km-size fragments, and only parent bodies ≥100 km are able to generate enough fragments for mutual collisions to be significant. Hence, those large asteroids experience a disc phase before being accreted.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.5671L
Real-time discovery of AT2020xnd: a fast, luminous ultraviolet transient with minimal radioactive ejecta;;The many unusual properties of the enigmatic AT2018cow suggested that at least some subset of the empirical class of fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) represents a genuinely new astrophysical phenomenon. Unfortunately, the intrinsic rarity and fleeting nature of these events have made it difficult to identify additional examples early enough to acquire the observations necessary to constrain theoretical models. We present here the Zwicky Transient Facility discovery of AT2020xnd (ZTF20acigmel, the 'Camel') at z = 0.243, the first unambiguous AT2018cow analogue to be found and confirmed in real time. AT2018cow and AT2020xnd share all key observational properties: a fast optical rise, sustained high photospheric temperature, absence of a second peak attributable to ejection of a radioactively heated stellar envelope, extremely luminous radio, millimetre, and X-ray emission, and a dwarf-galaxy host. This supports the argument that AT2018cow-like events represent a distinct phenomenon from slower-evolving radio-quiet supernovae, likely requiring a different progenitor or a different central engine. The sample properties of the four known members of this class to date disfavour tidal disruption models but are consistent with the alternative model of an accretion powered jet following the direct collapse of a massive star to a black hole. Contextual filtering of alert streams combined with rapid photometric verification using multiband imaging provides an efficient way to identify future members of this class, even at high redshift.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.5138P
Transitional events in the spectrophotometric regime between stripped envelope and superluminous supernovae;;The division between stripped-envelope supernovae (SE-SNe) and superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) is not well-defined in either photometric or spectroscopic space. While a sharp luminosity threshold has been suggested, there remains an increasing number of transitional objects that reach this threshold without the spectroscopic signatures common to SLSNe. In this work, we present data and analysis on four SNe transitional between SE-SNe and SLSNe; the He-poor SNe 2019dwa and 2019cri, and the He-rich SNe 2019hge and 2019unb. Each object displays long-lived and variable photometric evolution with luminosities around the SLSN threshold of M<SUB>r</SUB> < -19.8 mag. Spectroscopically however, these objects are similar to SE-SNe, with line velocities lower than either SE-SNe and SLSNe, and thus represent an interesting case of rare transitional events.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.4342P
Birth of the ELMs: a ZTF survey for evolved cataclysmic variables turning into extremely low-mass white dwarfs;;We present a systematic survey for mass-transferring and recently detached cataclysmic variables (CVs) with evolved secondaries, which are progenitors of extremely low mass white dwarfs (ELM WDs), AM CVn systems, and detached ultracompact binaries. We select targets below the main sequence in the Gaia colour-magnitude diagram with ZTF light curves showing large-amplitude ellipsoidal variability and orbital period P<SUB>orb</SUB> < 6 h. This yields 51 candidates brighter than G = 18, of which we have obtained many-epoch spectra for 21. We confirm all 21 to be completely or nearly Roche lobe filling close binaries. Thirteen show evidence of ongoing mass transfer, which has likely just ceased in the other eight. Most of the secondaries are hotter than any previously known CV donors, with temperatures 4700 < T<SUB>eff</SUB>/K < 8000. Remarkably, all secondaries with $T_{\rm eff} rsim 7000\, \rm K$ appear to be detached, while all cooler secondaries are still mass-transferring. This transition likely marks the temperature where magnetic braking becomes inefficient due to loss of the donor's convective envelope. Most of the proto-WD secondaries have masses near $0.15\, \rm M_{\odot }$; their companions have masses near $0.8\, \rm M_{\odot }$. We infer a space density of $\sim 60\, \rm kpc^{-3}$, roughly 80 times lower than that of normal CVs and three times lower than that of ELM WDs. The implied Galactic birth rate, $\mathcal {R}\sim 60\, \rm Myr^{-1}$, is half that of AM CVn binaries. Most systems are well-described by MESA models for CVs in which mass transfer begins only as the donor leaves the main sequence. All are predicted to reach minimum periods 5 ≲ P<SUB>orb</SUB> min<SUP>-1</SUP> ≲ 30 within a Hubble time, where they will become AM CVn binaries or merge. This sample triples the known evolved CV population and offers broad opportunities for improving understanding of the compact binary population.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.4106E
Detection of periodic signals in AGN red noise light curves: empirical tests on the Auto-Correlation Function and Phase Dispersion Minimization;;Active galactic nucleus (AGN) emission is dominated by stochastic, aperiodic variability which overwhelms any periodic/quasi-periodic signal (QPO) if one is present. The Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) and Phase Dispersion Minimization (PDM) techniques have been used previously to claim detections of QPOs in AGN light curves. In this paper, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to empirically test QPO detection feasibility in the presence of red noise. Given the community's access to large data bases of monitoring light curves via large-area monitoring programmes, our goal is to provide guidance to those searching for QPOs via data trawls. We simulate evenly sampled pure red noise light curves to estimate false alarm probabilities; false positives in both tools tend to occur towards time-scales longer than (very roughly) one-third of the light-curve duration. We simulate QPOs mixed with pure red noise and determine the true-positive detection sensitivity; in both tools, it depends strongly on the relative strength of the QPO against the red noise and on the steepness of the red noise PSD slope. We find that extremely large values of peak QPO power relative to red noise (typically ~10<SUP>4-5</SUP>) are needed for a 99.7 per cent true-positive detection rate. Given that the true-positive detections using the ACF or PDM are generally rare to obtain, we conclude that period searches based on the ACF or PDM must be treated with extreme caution when the data quality is not good. We consider the feasibility of QPO detection in the context of highly inclined, periodically self-lensing supermassive black hole binaries.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.3975K
First tidal disruption events discovered by SRG/eROSITA: X-ray/optical properties and X-ray luminosity function at z < 0.6;;We present the first sample of tidal disruption events (TDEs) discovered during the SRG all-sky survey. These 13 events were selected among X-ray transients detected in the 0° < l < 180° hemisphere by eROSITA during its second sky survey (2020 June 10 to December 14) and confirmed by optical follow-up observations. The most distant event occurred at z = 0.581. One TDE continued to brighten at least 6 months. The X-ray spectra are consistent with nearly critical accretion on to black holes of a few ×10<SUP>3</SUP> to $10^8\, \mathrm{ M}_\odot$, although supercritical accretion is possibly taking place. In two TDEs, a spectral hardening is observed 6 months after the discovery. Four TDEs showed an optical brightening apart from the X-ray outburst. The other nine TDEs demonstrate no optical activity. All 13 TDEs are optically faint, with L<SUB>g</SUB>/L<SUB>X</SUB> < 0.3 (L<SUB>g</SUB> and L<SUB>X</SUB> being the g band and 0.2-6 keV luminosity, respectively). We have constructed a TDE X-ray luminosity function, which can be fit by a power law with a slope of -0.6 ± 0.2, similar to the trend observed for optically selected TDEs. The total rate is estimated at (1.1 ± 0.5) × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> TDEs per galaxy per year, an order of magnitude lower than inferred from optical studies. This suggests that X-ray bright events constitute a minority of TDEs, consistent with models predicting that X-rays can only be observed from directions close to the axis of a thick accretion disc formed from the stellar debris. Our TDE detection threshold can be lowered by a factor of ~2, which should allow a detection of ~700 TDEs by the end of the SRG survey.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.3820S
TACOS: TESS AM CVn Outbursts Survey;;Using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we are doing a systematic study of outbursting AM CVn systems to place some limits on the current outbursts models. We present the TESS light curve (LC) for 9 AM CVns showing both superoutbursts (SOs) and normal outbursts (NOs). The continuous coverage of the outbursts with TESS allows us to place stringent limits on the duration and structures of the SOs and the NOs. We present evidence that in at least some of the systems enhanced mass transfer (EMT) has to be taken into account to explain the observed LC of the SOs and rebrighthening phase after the SOs. For others, the colour evolution from simultaneous observations in g and r with ZTF differs from previously reported colour evolution of longer period AM CVns where EMT is responsible for the SO. We also find that due to the lack of sufficiently high cadence coverage the duration of many systems might have been overestimated in previous ground-based surveys. We report the SO duration for 6 AM CVns. We also found that precursors are a common feature of SOs in AM CVns and are seen in the LC of 5 of the 6 reported SOs. Finally, the 10-min and 2-min cadence LCs from TESS also allowed us to find two new candidate orbital periods of AM CVns, both of which are in reasonably good agreement with the predictions for their periods based on their past outburst histories.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.3275P
Gravitational self-lensing in populations of massive black hole binaries;;The community may be on the verge of detecting low-frequency gravitational waves from massive black hole binaries (MBHBs), but no examples of binary active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been confirmed. Because MBHBs are intrinsically rare, the most promising detection methods utilize photometric data from all-sky surveys. Gravitational self-lensing has recently been proposed as a method of detecting AGN in close separation binaries. In this study, we calculate the detectability of lensing signatures in realistic populations of simulated MBHBs. Within our model assumptions, we find that VRO's LSST should be able to detect tens to hundreds of self-lensing binaries, with the rate uncertainty depending primarily on the orientation of AGN discs relative to their binary orbits. Roughly a quarter of lensing detectable systems should also show detectable Doppler boosting signatures. If AGN discs tend to be aligned with the orbit, lensing signatures are very nearly achromatic, while in misaligned configurations, the bluer optical bands are lensed more than redder ones. Whether substantial obscuring material (e.g. a dusty torus) will be present in close binaries remains uncertain, but our estimates suggest that a substantial fraction of systems would still be observable in this case.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.2524K
Simulating highly eccentric common envelope jet supernova impostors;;We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of eccentric common envelope jet supernova (CEJSN) impostors, i.e. a neutron star that crosses through the envelope of a red supergiant star on a highly eccentric orbit and launches jets as it accretes mass from the envelope. Because of numerical limitations, we apply a simple prescription where we inject the assumed jets' power into two opposite conical regions inside the envelope. We find the outflow morphology to be very complicated, clumpy, and non-spherical, having a large-scale symmetry only about the equatorial plane. The outflow morphology can substantially differ between simulations that differ by their jets' power. We estimate by simple means the light curve to be very bumpy, to have a rise time of one to a few months, and to slowly decay in about a year to several years. These eccentric CEJSN impostors will be classified as 'gap' objects, i.e. having a luminosity between those of classical novae and typical supernovae (termed also ILOTs for intermediate luminosity optical transients). We strengthen a previous conclusion that CEJSN impostors might account for some peculiar ILOTs, in particular those that might repeat over time-scales of months to years.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.2386S
Time domain astronomy with the THESEUS satellite;;THESEUS is a medium size space mission of the European Space Agency, currently under evaluation for a possible launch in 2032. Its main objectives are to investigate the early Universe through the observation of gamma-ray bursts and to study the gravitational waves electromagnetic counterparts and neutrino events. On the other hand, its instruments, which include a wide field of view X-ray (0.3-5 keV) telescope based on lobster-eye focussing optics and a gamma-ray spectrometer with imaging capabilities in the 2-150 keV range, are also ideal for carrying out unprecedented studies in time domain astrophysics. In addition, the presence onboard of a 70 cm near infrared telescope will allow simultaneous multiwavelegth studies. Here we present the THESEUS capabilities for studying the time variability of different classes of sources in parallel to, and without affecting, the gamma-ray bursts hunt.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ExA....52..309M
Current observations are insufficient to confidently associate the binary black hole merger GW190521 with AGN J124942.3 + 344929;;Recently, Graham et al (2020 arXiv:2006.14122) identified ZTF19abanrhr as a candidate electromagnetic counterpart to the binary black hole merger GW190521. The authors argue that the observations are consistent with a kicked binary black hole interacting with the accretion disk of the active galactic nucleus AGN J124942.3 + 344929. If a real association (rather than happenstance), this has implications for the sources of LIGO/Virgo binary mergers, future prospects for electromagnetic counterparts, and measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe. In this work, we provide an analysis of the multi-messenger coincident-significance based on the localisation overlap and find that, under optimistic assumptions, the odds of a common source for GW190521 and ZTF19abanrhr range between 1 and 12. These odds are strongly dependent on the waveform model and, with current models, are unable to consistently capture both the effects of precession and orbital eccentricity. We consider this insufficient evidence to warrant confidently associating GW190521 with ZTF19abanrhr and hence caution against any astrophysical conclusions based on the association.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021CQGra..38w5004A
A Catalog of 323 Cataclysmic Variables from LAMOST DR6;;In this work, we present a catalog of cataclysmic variables (CVs) identified from the sixth data release (DR6) of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). To single out the CV spectra, we introduce a novel machine-learning algorithm called UMAP to screen out a total of 169,509 Hα emission spectra, and obtain a classification accuracy of the algorithm of over 99.6% from the cross-validation set. We then apply the template-matching program PyHammer v2.0 to the LAMOST spectra to obtain the optimal spectral type with metallicity, which help us identify the chromospherically active stars and potential binary stars from the 169,509 spectra. After visually inspecting all of the spectra, we identify 323 CV candidates from the LAMOST database, among them 52 objects are new. We further classify the new CV candidates in subtypes based on their spectral features, including five DN subtypes during outbursts, five NL subtypes, and four magnetic CVs (three AM Her type and one IP type). We also find two CVs that have been previously identified by photometry and confirm their previous classification with the LAMOST spectra.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..257...65S
Masses of White Dwarf Binary Companions to Type Ia Supernovae Measured from Runaway Velocities;;The recently proposed "dynamically driven double-degenerate double-detonation" (D<SUP>6</SUP>) scenario posits that Type Ia supernovae (SNe) may occur during dynamically unstable mass transfer between two white dwarfs (WDs) in a binary. This scenario predicts that the donor WD may then survive the explosion and be released as a hypervelocity runaway, opening up the exciting possibility of identifying remnant stars from D<SUP>6</SUP> SNe and using them to study the physics of detonations that produce Type Ia SNe. Three candidate D<SUP>6</SUP> runaway objects have been identified in Gaia data. The observable runaway velocity of these remnant objects represents their orbital speed at the time of SN detonation. The orbital dynamics and Roche lobe geometry required in the D<SUP>6</SUP> scenario place specific constraints on the radius and mass of the donor WD that becomes the hypervelocity runaway. In this Letter, we calculate the radii required for D<SUP>6</SUP> donor WDs as a function of the runaway velocity. Using mass-radius relations for WDs, we then constrain the masses of the donor stars as well. With measured velocities for each of the three D<SUP>6</SUP> candidate objects based on Gaia EDR3, this work provides a new probe of the masses and mass ratios in WD binary systems that produce SN detonations and hypervelocity runaways.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923L..34B
Constraints on the Electromagnetic Counterpart of the Neutron-star-Black-hole Merger GW200115;;We report the results of our follow-up campaign for the neutron-star-black-hole (NSBH) merger GW200115 detected during the O3 run of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. We obtained wide-field observations with the Deca-Degree Optical Transient Imager covering ~20% of the total probability area down to a limiting magnitude of w = 20.5 AB at ~23 hr after the merger. Our search for counterparts returns a single candidate (AT2020aeo), likely not associated with the merger. In total, only 25 sources of interest were identified by the community and later discarded as unrelated to the GW event. We compare our upper limits with the emission predicted by state-of-the-art kilonova simulations and disfavor high-mass ejecta (>0.1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>), indicating that the spin of the system is not particularly high. By combining our optical limits with gamma-ray constraints from Swift and Fermi, we disfavor the presence of a standard short-duration burst for viewing angles ≲15° from the jet axis. Our conclusions are, however, limited by the large localization region of this GW event, and accurate prompt positions remain crucial to improving the efficiency of follow-up efforts.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923L..32D
Discovery of the Fastest Early Optical Emission from Overluminous SN Ia 2020hvf: A Thermonuclear Explosion within a Dense Circumstellar Environment;;In this Letter we report a discovery of a prominent flash of a peculiar overluminous Type Ia supernova, SN 2020hvf, in about 5 hr of the supernova explosion by the first wide-field mosaic CMOS sensor imager, the Tomo-e Gozen Camera. The fast evolution of the early flash was captured by intensive intranight observations via the Tomo-e Gozen high-cadence survey. Numerical simulations show that such a prominent and fast early emission is most likely generated from an interaction between 0.01 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> circumstellar material (CSM) extending to a distance of ~10<SUP>13</SUP> cm and supernova ejecta soon after the explosion, indicating a confined dense CSM formation at the final evolution stage of the progenitor of SN 2020hvf. Based on the CSM-ejecta interaction-induced early flash, the overluminous light curve, and the high ejecta velocity of SN 2020hvf, we suggest that the SN 2020hvf may originate from a thermonuclear explosion of a super-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf ("super-M <SUB>Ch</SUB> WD"). Systematical investigations on explosion mechanisms and hydrodynamic simulations of the super-M <SUB>Ch</SUB> WD explosion are required to further test the suggested scenario and understand the progenitor of this peculiar supernova.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923L...8J
An Isolated White Dwarf with a 70 s Spin Period;;We report the discovery of an isolated white dwarf with a spin period of 70 s. We obtained high-speed photometry of three ultramassive white dwarfs within 100 pc and discovered significant variability in one. SDSS J221141.80+113604.4 is a 1.27 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> (assuming a CO core) magnetic white dwarf that shows 2.9% brightness variations in the BG40 filter with a 70.32 ± 0.04 s period, becoming the fastest spinning isolated white dwarf currently known. A detailed model atmosphere analysis shows that it has a mixed hydrogen and helium atmosphere with a dipole field strength of B <SUB> d </SUB> = 15 MG. Given its large mass, fast rotation, strong magnetic field, unusual atmospheric composition, and relatively large tangential velocity for its cooling age, J2211+1136 displays all of the signatures of a double white dwarf merger remnant. Long-term monitoring of the spin evolution of J2211+1136 and other fast-spinning isolated white dwarfs opens a new discovery space for substellar and planetary mass companions around white dwarfs. In addition, the discovery of such fast rotators outside of the ZZ Ceti instability strip suggests that some should also exist within the strip. Hence, some of the monoperiodic variables found within the instability strip may be fast-spinning white dwarfs impersonating ZZ Ceti pulsators.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923L...6K
Swift/XRT Deep Galactic Plane Survey Discovery of a New Intermediate Polar Cataclysmic Variable, Swift J183920.1-045350;;We report on the Swift/XRT Deep Galactic Plane Survey discovery and multiwavelength follow-up observations of a new intermediate polar (IP) cataclysmic variable, Swift J183920.1-045350. A 449.7 s spin period is found in XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data, accompanied by a 459.9 s optical period that is most likely the synodic, or beat period, produced from a 5.6 hr orbital period. The orbital period is seen with moderate significance in independent long-baseline optical photometry observations taken with the ZTF and SAAO telescopes. We find that the X-ray pulse fraction of the source decreases with increasing energy. The X-ray spectra are consistent with the presence of an Fe emission line complex with both local and interstellar absorption. In the optical spectra, strong Hα, H I, He I, and He II emission lines are observed, all common features in magnetic CVs. The source properties are thus typical of known IPs, with the exception of its estimated distance of ${2.26}_{-0.83}^{+1.93}$ kpc, which is larger than typical, extending the reach of the CV population in our Galaxy.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923..243G
LTD064402+245919: A Subgiant with a 1-3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> Undetected Companion Identified from LAMOST-TD Data;;Single-line spectroscopic binaries have recently contributed to stellar-mass black hole discovery, independently of the X-ray transient method. We report the identification of a single-line binary system, LTD064402+245919, with an orbital period of 14.50 days. The observed component is a subgiant with a mass of 2.77 ± 0.68 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius 15.5 ± 2.5 R <SUB>⊙</SUB>, effective temperature T <SUB>eff</SUB> 4500 ± 200 K, and surface gravity log g 2.5 ± 0.25 dex. The discovery makes use of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope time-domain and Zwicky Transient Facility survey. Our general-purpose software pipeline applies a Lomb-Scargle periodogram to determine the orbital period and uses machine learning to classify the variable type from the folded light curves. We apply a combined model to estimate the orbital parameters from both the light and radial velocity curves, taking constraints on the primary star mass, mass function, and detection limit of secondary luminosity into consideration. We obtain a radial velocity semiamplitude of 44.6 ± 1.5 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, mass ratio of 0.73 ± 0.07, and an undetected component mass of 2.02 ± 0.49 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> when the type of the undetected component is not set. We conclude that the inclination is not well constrained, and that the secondary mass is larger than 1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> when the undetected component is modeled as a compact object. According to our investigations using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulation, increasing the spectra signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 3 would enable the secondary light to be distinguished (if present). The algorithm and software in this work are able to serve as general-purpose tools for the identification of compact objects quiescent in X-rays.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923..226Y
Supercritical Accretion of Stellar-mass Compact Objects in Active Galactic Nuclei;;Accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been proposed as promising sites for producing both (stellar-mass) compact object mergers and extreme mass ratio inspirals. Along with disk-assisted migration, ambient gas inevitably accretes onto compact objects. In previous studies, it was commonly assumed that either an Eddington rate or a Bondi rate takes place, although they can differ by several orders of magnitude. As a result, the mass and spin evolution of compact objects within AGN disks are essentially unknown. In this work, we construct a relativistic supercritical inflow-outflow model for black hole (BH) accretion. We show that the radiation efficiency of the supercritical accretion of a stellar-mass BH (sBH) is generally too low to explain the proposed electromagnetic counterpart of GW 190521. Applying this model to sBHs embedded in AGN disks, we find that, although the gas inflow rates at Bondi radii of these sBHs are commonly highly super-Eddington, a large fraction of inflowing gas eventually escapes as outflows so that only a small fraction accretes onto the sBH, resulting in mildly super-Eddington BH absorption in most cases. We also apply this model to neutron stars (NSs) and white dwarfs (WDs) in AGN disks. It turns out to be difficult for WDs to grow to the Chandrasekhar limit via accretion because WDs are spun up more efficiently to reach the shedding limit before the Chandrasekhar limit. For NSs accretion-induced collapse is possible if NS magnetic fields are sufficiently strong to keep the NS slowly rotating during accretion.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923..173P
V899 Mon: A Peculiar Eruptive Young Star Close to the End of Its Outburst;;The eruptive young star V899 Mon shows characteristics of both FUors and EXors. It reached a peak brightness in 2010, then briefly faded in 2011, followed by a second outburst. We conducted multifilter optical photometric monitoring, as well as optical and near-infrared spectroscopic observations, of V899 Mon. The light curves and color-magnitude diagrams show that V899 Mon has been gradually fading after its second outburst peak in 2018, but smaller accretion bursts are still happening. Our spectroscopic observations taken with Gemini/IGRINS and VLT/MUSE show a number of emission lines, unlike during the outbursting stage. We used the emission line fluxes to estimate the accretion rate and found that it has significantly decreased compared to the outbursting stage. The mass-loss rate is also weakening. Our 2D spectroastrometric analysis of emission lines recovered jet and disk emission of V899 Mon. We found that the emission from permitted metallic lines and the CO bandheads can be modeled well with a disk in Keplerian rotation, which also gives a tight constraint for the dynamical stellar mass of 2 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. After a discussion of the physical changes that led to the changes in the observed properties of V899 Mon, we suggest that this object is finishing its second outburst.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923..171P
SN 2018agk: A Prototypical Type Ia Supernova with a Smooth Power-law Rise in Kepler (K2);;We present the 30 minutes cadence Kepler/K2 light curve of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2018agk, covering approximately one week before explosion, the full rise phase, and the decline until 40 days after peak. We additionally present ground-based observations in multiple bands within the same time range, including the 1 day cadence DECam observations within the first ~5 days after the first light. The Kepler early light curve is fully consistent with a single power-law rise, without evidence of any bump feature. We compare SN 2018agk with a sample of other SNe Ia without early excess flux from the literature. We find that SNe Ia without excess flux have slowly evolving early colors in a narrow range (g - i ≈ -0.20 ± 0.20 mag) within the first ~10 days. On the other hand, among SNe Ia detected with excess, SN 2017cbv and SN 2018oh tend to be bluer, while iPTF16abc's evolution is similar to normal SNe Ia without excess in g - i. We further compare the Kepler light curve of SN 2018agk with companion-interaction models, and rule out the existence of a typical nondegenerate companion undergoing Roche lobe overflow at viewing angles smaller than 45°.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923..167W
Transients from the Cataclysmic Deaths of Cataclysmic Variables;;We explore the observational appearance of the merger of a low-mass star with a white dwarf (WD) binary companion. We are motivated by recent work finding that multiple tensions between the observed properties of cataclysmic variables (CVs) and standard evolution models are resolved if a large fraction of CV binaries merge as a result of unstable mass transfer. Tidal disruption of the secondary forms a geometrically thick disk around the WD, which subsequently accretes at highly super-Eddington rates. Analytic estimates and numerical hydrodynamical simulations reveal that outflows from the accretion flow unbind a large fraction ≳90% of the secondary at velocities ~500-1000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> within days of the merger. Hydrogen recombination in the expanding ejecta powers optical transient emission lasting about a month with a luminosity ≳10<SUP>38</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, similar to slow classical novae and luminous red novae from ordinary stellar mergers. Over longer timescales the mass accreted by the WD undergoes hydrogen shell burning, inflating the remnant into a giant of luminosity ~300-5000 L <SUB>⊙</SUB>, effective temperature T <SUB>eff</SUB> ≈ 3000 K, and lifetime ~10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. We predict that ~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> Milky Way giants are CV merger products, potentially distinguishable by atypical surface abundances. We explore whether any Galactic historical slow classical novae are masquerading CV mergers by identifying four such post-nova systems with potential giant counterparts for which a CV merger origin cannot be ruled out. We address whether the historical transient CK Vul and its gaseous/dusty nebula resulted from a CV merger.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923..100M
Local Environments of Low-redshift Supernovae;;We characterize the local (2 kpc sized) environments of Type Ia, II, and Ib/c supernovae (SNe) that have recently occurred in nearby (d ≲ 50 Mpc) galaxies. Using ultraviolet (UV; from Galaxy Evolution Explorer) and infrared (IR; from Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer) maps of 359 galaxies and a sample of 472 SNe, we measure the star formation rate surface density (Σ<SUB>SFR</SUB>) and stellar mass surface density (Σ<SUB>⋆</SUB>) in a 2 kpc beam centered on each SN site. We show that core-collapse SNe are preferentially located along the resolved galactic star-forming main sequence, whereas Type Ia SNe are extended to lower values of Σ<SUB>SFR</SUB> at fixed Σ<SUB>⋆</SUB>, indicative of locations inside quiescent galaxies or quiescent regions of galaxies. We also test how well the radial distribution of each SN type matches the radial distributions of UV and IR light in each host galaxy. We find that, to first order, the distributions of all types of SNe mirror those of both near-IR light (3.4 and 4.5 μm, tracing the stellar mass distribution) and mid-IR light (12 and 22 μm, tracing emission from hot, small grains), and also resemble our best-estimate Σ<SUB>SFR</SUB>. All types of SNe appear more radially concentrated than the UV emission of their host galaxies. In more detail, the distributions of Type II SNe show small statistical differences from those of near-IR light. We attribute this overall structural uniformity to the fact that within any individual galaxy, Σ<SUB>SFR</SUB> and Σ<SUB>⋆</SUB> track one another well, with variations in Σ<SUB>SFR</SUB>/Σ<SUB>⋆</SUB> most visible when comparing between galaxies.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923...86C
The Remarkable Spin-down and Ultrafast Outflows of the Highly Pulsed Supersoft Source of Nova Herculis 2021;;Nova Her 2021 (V1674 Her), which erupted on 2021 June 12, reached naked-eye brightness and has been detected from radio to γ-rays. An extremely fast optical decline of 2 magnitudes in 1.2 days and strong Ne lines imply a high-mass white dwarf. The optical pre-outburst detection of a 501.42 s oscillation suggests a magnetic white dwarf. This is the first time that an oscillation of this magnitude has been detected in a classical nova prior to outburst. We report X-ray outburst observations from Swift and Chandra that uniquely show (1) a very strong modulation of supersoft X-rays at a different period from reported optical periods, (2) strong pulse profile variations and the possible presence of period variations of the order of 0.1-0.3 s, and (3) rich grating spectra that vary with modulation phase and show P Cygni-type emission lines with two dominant blueshifted absorption components at ~3000 and 9000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> indicating expansion velocities up to 11,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. X-ray oscillations most likely arise from inhomogeneous photospheric emission related to the magnetic field. Period differences between reported pre- and post-outburst optical observations, if not due to other period drift mechanisms, suggest a large ejected mass for such a fast nova, in the range 2 × 10<SUP>-5</SUP>-2 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. A difference between the period found in the Chandra data and a reported contemporaneous post-outburst optical period, as well as the presence of period drifts, could be due to weakly nonrigid photospheric rotation.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922L..42D
AT 2018lqh: Black Hole Born from a Rotating Star?;;Recently an intriguing transient, AT 2018lqh, with only a day-scale duration and a high luminosity of 7 × 10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, was discovered. While several possibilities are raised on its origin, the nature of this transient is yet to be unveiled. We propose that a black hole (BH) with ~30 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> forming from a rotating blue supergiant can generate a transient like AT 2018lqh. We find that this scenario can consistently explain the optical/UV emission and the tentative late-time X-ray detection, as well as the radio upper limits. If super-Eddington accretion onto the nascent BH powers the X-ray emission, continued X-ray observations may be able to test the presence of an accretion disk around the BH.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922L..34T
The Challenges Ahead for Multimessenger Analyses of Gravitational Waves and Kilonova: A Case Study on GW190425;;In recent years, there have been significant advances in multimessenger astronomy due to the discovery of the first, and so far only confirmed, gravitational wave event with a simultaneous electromagnetic (EM) counterpart, as well as improvements in numerical simulations, gravitational wave (GW) detectors, and transient astronomy. This has led to the exciting possibility of performing joint analyses of the GW and EM data, providing additional constraints on fundamental properties of the binary progenitor and merger remnant. Here, we present a new Bayesian framework that allows inference of these properties, while taking into account the systematic modeling uncertainties that arise when mapping from GW binary progenitor properties to photometric light curves. We extend the relative binning method presented in Zackay et al. to include extrinsic GW parameters for fast analysis of the GW signal. The focus of our EM framework is on light curves arising from r-process nucleosynthesis in the ejected material during and after merger, the so-called kilonova, and particularly on black hole-neutron star systems. As a case study, we examine the recent detection of GW190425, where the primary object is consistent with being either a black hole or a neutron star. We show quantitatively how improved mapping between binary progenitor and outflow properties, and/or an increase in EM data quantity and quality are required in order to break degeneracies in the fundamental source parameters.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922..269R
Long-term Variability of the Composite Galaxy SDSS J103911-000057: A True Type-2 AGN Candidate;;In this manuscript, the composite galaxy SDSS J103911-000057 (=SDSS J1039) is reported as a true Type-2 AGN candidate without hidden BLRs. Only narrow emission lines, not broad, detected in SDSS J1039 can be confirmed both by the F-test technique and by the expected broad emission lines with an EW smaller than 13.5 Å with a 99% confidence level. Meanwhile, a reliable AGN power-law component is preferred with a confidence level higher than 7σ in SDSS J1039. Furthermore, the long-term variability of SDSS J1039 from Catalina Sky Survey can be described by the DRW process with an intrinsic variability timescale τ ~ 100 days, similar to normal quasars. And, based on BH mass in SDSS J1039 through the M <SUB>BH</SUB>-σ relation and on the correlation between AGN continuum luminosity and total Hα luminosity, the expected broad Hα, if there was one, could be reconstructed with a line width of about 300-1000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and with a line flux of about 666 × 10<SUP>-17</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> under the virialization assumption to BLRs, providing robust evidence to reject the probability that the intrinsic probable broad Hα was overwhelmed by noises of the SDSS spectrum in SDSS J1039. Moreover, SDSS J1039 follows the same correlation between continuum luminosity and [O III] line luminosity as the one for normal broad-line AGN, indicating SDSS J1039 classified as a changing-look AGN in the dim state can be ruled out. Therefore, under the current knowledge, SDSS J1039 is a better candidate for a true Type-2 AGN.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922..248X
AT 2018lqh and the Nature of the Emerging Population of Day-scale Duration Optical Transients;;We report on the discovery of AT 2018lqh (ZTF 18abfzgpl)-a rapidly evolving extragalactic transient in a star-forming host at 242 Mpc. The transient g-band light curve's duration above a half-maximum light is about 2.1 days, where 0.4/1.7 days are spent on the rise/decay, respectively. The estimated bolometric light curve of this object peaked at about 7 × 10<SUP>42</SUP>erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>-roughly 7 times brighter than the neutron star (NS)-NS merger event AT 2017gfo. We show that this event can be explained by an explosion with a fast (v ~ 0.08 c) low-mass (≈0.07 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) ejecta, composed mostly of radioactive elements. For example, ejecta dominated by <SUP>56</SUP>Ni with a timescale of t <SUB>0</SUB> ≅ 1.6 days for the ejecta to become optically thin for γ-rays fits the data well. Such a scenario requires burning at densities that are typically found in the envelopes of neutron stars or the cores of white dwarfs. A combination of circumstellar material (CSM) interaction power at early times and shock cooling at late times is consistent with the photometric observations, but the observed spectrum of the event may pose some challenges for this scenario. We argue that the observations are not consistent with a shock breakout from a stellar envelope, while a model involving a low-mass ejecta ramming into low-mass CSM cannot explain both the early- and late-time observations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922..247O
Phases of Mass Transfer from Hot Subdwarfs to White Dwarf Companions and Their Photometric Properties;;Binary systems of a hot subdwarf B (sdB) star + a white dwarf (WD) with orbital periods less than 2-3 hr can come into contact due to gravitational waves and transfer mass from the sdB star to the WD before the sdB star ceases nuclear burning and contracts to become a WD. Motivated by the growing class of observed systems in this category, we study the phases of mass transfer in these systems. We find that because the residual outer hydrogen envelope accounts for a large fraction of an sdB star's radius, sdB stars can spend a significant amount of time (~tens of megayears) transferring this small amount of material at low rates (~10<SUP>-10</SUP>-10<SUP>-9</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) before transitioning to a phase where the bulk of their He transfers at much faster rates ( ≳10<SUP>-8</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>). These systems therefore spend a surprising amount of time with Roche-filling sdB donors at orbital periods longer than the range associated with He star models without an envelope. We predict that the envelope transfer phase should be detectable by searching for ellipsoidal modulation of Roche-filling objects with P <SUB>orb</SUB> = 30-100 minutes and T <SUB>eff</SUB> = 20,000-30,000 K, and that many (≥10) such systems may be found in the Galactic plane after accounting for reddening. We also argue that many of these systems may go through a phase of He transfer that matches the signatures of AM CVn systems, and that some AM CVn systems associated with young stellar populations likely descend from this channel.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922..245B
Carnegie Supernova Project: The First Homogeneous Sample of Super-Chandrasekhar-mass/2003fg-like Type Ia Supernovae;;We present a multiwavelength photometric and spectroscopic analysis of 13 super-Chandrasekhar-mass/2003fg-like Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Nine of these objects were observed by the Carnegie Supernova Project. The 2003fg-like SNe have slowly declining light curves (Δm <SUB>15</SUB>(B) < 1.3 mag), and peak absolute B-band magnitudes of -19 < M <SUB> B </SUB> < -21 mag. Many of the 2003fg-like SNe are located in the same part of the luminosity-width relation as normal SNe Ia. In the optical B and V bands, the 2003fg-like SNe look like normal SNe Ia, but at redder wavelengths they diverge. Unlike other luminous SNe Ia, the 2003fg-like SNe generally have only one i-band maximum, which peaks after the epoch of the B-band maximum, while their near-IR (NIR) light-curve rise times can be ≳40 days longer than those of normal SNe Ia. They are also at least 1 mag brighter in the NIR bands than normal SNe Ia, peaking above M <SUB> H </SUB> = -19 mag, and generally have negative Hubble residuals, which may be the cause of some systematics in dark-energy experiments. Spectroscopically, the 2003fg-like SNe exhibit peculiarities such as unburnt carbon well past maximum light, a large spread (8000-12,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) in Si II λ6355 velocities at maximum light with no rapid early velocity decline, and no clear H-band break at +10 days. We find that SNe with a larger pseudo-equivalent width of C II at maximum light have lower Si II λ6355 velocities and more slowly declining light curves. There are also multiple factors that contribute to the peak luminosity of 2003fg-like SNe. The explosion of a C-O degenerate core inside a carbon-rich envelope is consistent with these observations. Such a configuration may come from the core-degenerate scenario.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922..205A
Are Stripped Envelope Supernovae Really Deficient in <SUP>56</SUP>Ni?;;Recent works have indicated that the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni masses estimated for stripped envelope supernovae (SESNe) are systematically higher than those estimated for SNe II. Although this may suggest a distinct progenitor structure between these types of SNe, the possibility remains that this may be caused by observational bias. One important possible bias is that SESNe with low <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass are dim, and therefore more likely to escape detection. By investigating the distributions of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass and distance of the samples collected from the literature, we find that the current literature SESN sample indeed suffers from a significant observational bias, i.e., objects with low <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass-if they exist-will be missed, especially at larger distances. Note, however, that those distant objects in our sample are mostly SNe Ic-BL. We also conducted mock observations assuming that the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass distribution for SESNe is intrinsically the same as that of SNe II. We find that the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass distribution of the detected SESN samples moves toward higher mass than the assumed intrinsic distribution because of the difficulty in detecting the low-<SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass SESNe. These results could explain the general trend of the higher <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass distribution (than SNe II) of SESNe found thus far in the literature. However, further finding clear examples of low-<SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass SESNe (≤ 0.01 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) is required to strengthen this hypothesis. Also, objects with high <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass (≳ 0.2 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) are not explained by our model, which may require an additional explanation.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922..141O
Mysterious Dust-emitting Object Orbiting TIC 400799224;;We report the discovery of a unique object of uncertain nature-but quite possibly a disintegrating asteroid or minor planet-orbiting one star of the widely separated binary TIC 400799224. We initially identified the system in data from TESS Sector 10 via an abnormally shaped fading event in the light curve (hereafter "dips"). Follow-up speckle imaging determined that TIC 400799224 is actually two stars of similar brightness at 0.″62 separation, forming a likely bound binary with projected separation of ~300 au. We cannot yet determine which star in the binary is host to the dips in flux. ASAS-SN and Evryscope archival data show that there is a strong periodicity of the dips at ~19.77 days, leading us to believe that an occulting object is orbiting the host star, though the duration, depth, and shape of the dips vary substantially. Statistical analysis of the ASAS-SN data shows that the dips only occur sporadically at a detectable threshold in approximately one out of every three to five transits, lending credence to the possibility that the occulter is a sporadically emitted dust cloud. The cloud is also fairly optically thick, blocking up to 37% or 75% of the light from the host star, depending on the true host. Further observations may allow for greater detail to be gleaned as to the origin and composition of the occulter, as well as to a determination of which of the two stars comprising TIC 400799224 is the true host star of the dips.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..299P
Gemini/GMOS Transmission Spectroscopy of the Grazing Planet Candidate WD 1856+534 b;;WD 1856+534 b is a Jupiter-sized, cool giant planet candidate transiting the white dwarf WD 1856+534. Here, we report an optical transmission spectrum of WD 1856+534 b obtained from ten transits using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph. This system is challenging to observe due to the faintness of the host star and the short transit duration. Nevertheless, our phase-folded white light curve reached a precision of 0.12%. WD 1856+534 b provides a unique transit configuration compared to other known exoplanets: the planet is 8× larger than its star and occults over half of the stellar disk during mid-transit. Consequently, many standard modeling assumptions do not hold. We introduce the concept of a "limb darkening corrected, time-averaged transmission spectrum" and propose that this is more suitable than ${({R}_{p,\lambda }/{R}_{s})}^{2}$ for comparisons to atmospheric models for planets with grazing transits. We also present a modified radiative transfer prescription. Though the transmission spectrum shows no prominent absorption features, it is sufficiently precise to constrain the mass of WD 1856+534 b to be >0.84 M <SUB> J </SUB> (to 2σ confidence), assuming a clear atmosphere and a Jovian composition. High-altitude cloud decks can allow lower masses. WD 1856+534 b could have formed either as a result of common envelope evolution or migration under the Kozai-Lidov mechanism. Further studies of WD 1856+534 b, alongside new dedicated searches for substellar objects around white dwarfs, will shed further light on the mysteries of post-main-sequence planetary systems.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..296X
Prospects for Detecting Exoplanets around Double White Dwarfs with LISA and Taiji;;Recently, Tamanini & Danielski discussed the possibility of detecting circumbinary exoplanets (CBPs) orbiting double white dwarfs (DWDs) with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Extending their methods and criteria, we discuss the prospects for detecting exoplanets around DWDs not only by LISA, but also by Taiji, a Chinese space-borne gravitational-wave (GW) mission that has slightly better sensitivity at low frequencies. We first explore how different binary masses and mass ratios affect the abilities of LISA and Taiji to detect CBPs. Second, for certain known detached DWDs with high signal-to-noise ratios, we quantify the possibility of CBP detections around them. Third, based on the DWD population obtained from the Mock LISA Data Challenge, we present basic assessments of the CBP detections in our Galaxy during a 4 yr mission time for LISA and Taiji. We discuss the constraints on the detectable zone of each system, as well as the distributions of the inner/outer edge of the detectable zone. With the DWD population, we further inject two different planet distributions with an occurrence rate of 50% and constrain the total detection rates. We briefly discuss the prospects for detecting habitable CBPs around DWDs with a simplified model. These results can provide helpful inputs for upcoming exoplanetary projects and help analyze planetary systems after the common envelope phase.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..247K
Exploring the Solar System with the NOIRLab Source Catalog I: Detecting Objects with CANFind;;Despite extensive searches and the relative proximity of solar system objects (SSOs) to Earth, many remain undiscovered and there is still much to learn about their properties and interactions. This work is the first in a series dedicated to detecting and analyzing SSOs in the all-sky NOIRLab Source Catalog (NSC). We search the first data release of the NSC with CANFind, a Computationally Automated NSC tracklet Finder. NSC DR1 contains 34 billion measurements of 2.9 billion unique objects, which CANFind categorizes as belonging to "stationary" (distant stars, galaxies) or moving (SSOs) objects via an iterative clustering method. Detections of stationary bodies for proper-motion μ ≤ 2.″5 hr<SUP>-1</SUP> (0.°017 day<SUP>-1</SUP>) are identified and analyzed separately. Remaining detections belonging to high-μ objects are clustered together over single nights to form "tracklets." Each tracklet contains detections of an individual moving object, and is validated based on spatial linearity and motion through time. Proper motions are then calculated and used to connect tracklets and other unassociated measurements over multiple nights by predicting their locations at common times, forming "tracks." This method extracted 527,055 tracklets from NSC DR1 in an area covering 29,971 square degrees of the sky. The data show distinct groups of objects with similar observed μ in ecliptic coordinates, namely Main Belt Asteroids, Jupiter Trojans, and Kuiper Belt Objects. Apparent magnitudes range from 10 to 25 mag in the ugrizY and VR bands. Color-color diagrams show a bimodality of tracklets between primarily carbonaceous and siliceous groups, supporting prior studies.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..244F
Alert Classification for the ALeRCE Broker System: The Real-time Stamp Classifier;;We present a real-time stamp classifier of astronomical events for the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events broker, ALeRCE. The classifier is based on a convolutional neural network, trained on alerts ingested from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Using only the science, reference, and difference images of the first detection as inputs, along with the metadata of the alert as features, the classifier is able to correctly classify alerts from active galactic nuclei, supernovae (SNe), variable stars, asteroids, and bogus classes, with high accuracy (~94%) in a balanced test set. In order to find and analyze SN candidates selected by our classifier from the ZTF alert stream, we designed and deployed a visualization tool called SN Hunter, where relevant information about each possible SN is displayed for the experts to choose among candidates to report to the Transient Name Server database. From 2019 June 26 to 2021 February 28, we have reported 6846 SN candidates to date (11.8 candidates per day on average), of which 971 have been confirmed spectroscopically. Our ability to report objects using only a single detection means that 70% of the reported SNe occurred within one day after the first detection. ALeRCE has only reported candidates not otherwise detected or selected by other groups, therefore adding new early transients to the bulk of objects available for early follow-up. Our work represents an important milestone toward rapid alert classifications with the next generation of large etendue telescopes, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..231C
A buyer's guide to the Hubble constant;;Since the expansion of the universe was first established by Edwin Hubble and Georges Lemaître about a century ago, the Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB> which measures its rate has been of great interest to astronomers. Besides being interesting in its own right, few properties of the universe can be deduced without it. In the last decade, a significant gap has emerged between different methods of measuring it, some anchored in the nearby universe, others at cosmological distances. The SH0ES team has found H<SUB>0</SUB>=73.2 ±1.3 kms-<SUP>1</SUP>Mpc-<SUP>1</SUP> locally, whereas the value found for the early universe by the Planck Collaboration is H<SUB>0</SUB>=67.4 ±0.5 kms-<SUP>1</SUP>Mpc-<SUP>1</SUP> from measurements of the cosmic microwave background. Is this gap a sign that the well-established Λ CDM cosmological model is somehow incomplete? Or are there unknown systematics? And more practically, how should humble astronomers pick between competing claims if they need to assume a value for a certain purpose? In this article, we review results and what changes to the cosmological model could be needed to accommodate them all. For astronomers in a hurry, we provide a buyer's guide to the results, and make recommendations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&ARv..29....9S
Star formation and nuclear activity in luminous infrared galaxies: an infrared through radio review;;Nearby galaxies offer unique laboratories allowing multi-wavelength spatially resolved studies of the interstellar medium, star formation and nuclear activity across a broad range of physical conditions. In particular, detailed studies of individual local luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) are crucial for gaining a better understanding of these processes and for developing and testing models that are used to explain statistical studies of large populations of such galaxies at high redshift for which it is currently impossible to reach a sufficient physical resolution. Here, we provide an overview of the impact of spatially resolved infrared, sub-millimetre and radio observations in the study of the interstellar medium, star formation and active galactic nuclei as well as their interplay in local LIRGs. We also present an overview of the modelling of their spectral energy distributions using state-of-the-art radiative transfer codes. These contribute necessary and powerful `workhorse' tools for the study of LIRGs (and their more luminous counterparts) at higher redshifts which are unresolved in observations. We describe how spatially-resolved time-domain observations have recently opened a new window to study the nuclear activity in LIRGs. We describe in detail the observational characteristics of Arp 299 which is one of the best studied local LIRGs and exemplifies the power of the combination of time-domain and high-resolution observations at infrared to radio wavelengths together with radiative transfer modelling used to explain the spectral energy distributions of its different components. We summarise the previous achievements obtained using high-spatial resolution observations and provide an outlook into what we can expect to achieve with future facilities.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&ARv..29....2P
SRG X-ray orbital observatory. Its telescopes and first scientific results;;The orbital observatory Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG), equipped with the grazing-incidence X-ray telescopes Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC and eROSITA, was launched by Roscosmos to the Lagrange L2 point of the Sun-Earth system on July 13, 2019. The launch was carried out from the Baikonur Cosmodrome by a Proton-M rocket with a DM-03 upper stage. The German telescope eROSITA was installed on SRG under an agreement between Roskosmos and the DLR, the German Aerospace Agency. In December 2019, SRG started to perform its main scientific task: scanning the celestial sphere to obtain X-ray maps of the entire sky in several energy ranges (from 0.2 to 8 keV with eROSITA, and from 4 to 30 keV with ART-XC). By mid-June 2021, the third six-month all-sky survey had been completed. Over a period of four years, it is planned to obtain eight independent maps of the entire sky in each of the energy ranges. The sum of these maps will provide high sensitivity and reveal more than three million quasars and over one hundred thousand massive galaxy clusters and galaxy groups. The availability of eight sky maps will enable monitoring of long-term variability (every six months) of a huge number of extragalactic and Galactic X-ray sources, including hundreds of thousands of stars with hot coronae. In addition, the rotation of the satellite around the axis directed toward the Sun with a period of four hours enables tracking the faster variability of bright X-ray sources during one day every half year. The chosen strategy of scanning the sky leads to the formation of deep survey zones near both ecliptic poles. The paper presents sky maps obtained by the telescopes on board SRG during the first survey of the entire sky and a number of results of deep observations performed during the flight to the L2 point in the frame of the performance verification program, demonstrating the capabilities of the observatory in imaging, spectroscopy, and timing of X-ray sources. It is planned that in December 2023, the observatory will for at least two years switch to observations of the most interesting sources in the sky in triaxial orientation mode and deep scanning of selected celestial fields with an area of up to 150 square degrees. These modes of operation were tested during the performance verification phase. Every day, data from the SRG observatory are dumped onto the largest antennas of the Russian Deep Space Network in Bear Lakes and near Ussuriysk.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...656A.132S
A case study of ACV variables discovered in the Zwicky Transient Facility survey;;Context. Magnetic chemically peculiar (mCP) stars exhibit complex atmospheres that allow the investigation of the interplay of atomic diffusion, magnetic fields, and stellar rotation. A non-uniform surface distribution of chemical elements and the non-alignment of the rotational and magnetic axes result in the variability of several observables. Photometrically variable mCP stars are referred to as α<SUP>2</SUP> Canum Venaticorum (ACV) variables. 
 Aims: The present work presents a case study of known variables from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, with the aim of investigating the survey's suitability for the detection and study of new ACV variables. 
 Methods: Using suitable selection criteria based on the known characteristics of ACV variables, candidate ACV stars were selected from the ZTF Catalog of Periodic Variable Stars. All light curves were inspected in detail to select the most promising candidates. Where available, low-resolution spectra from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) were employed to classify the stars on the MK system and confirm their status as mCP stars. 
 Results: We have identified 86 new promising ACV star candidates. Fifteen of these stars have LAMOST spectra available that, in all cases, confirm them as classical mCP stars, which highlights the viability of our approach. We present astrophysical parameters for all sample stars that can be sorted into four subgroups characterized by distinct light curve shapes. Anti-phase variations in different photometric passbands, in particular, are a unique characteristic of a subset of ACV stars readily usable for their identification. The availability of data in three different passbands (g, r, and i) is a major advantage of the ZTF survey. 
 Conclusions: On the basis of our experience with other photometric surveys and the analysis of light curves, we conclude that the ZTF is well suited to the search for, and the analysis of, ACV variables that are not considered in the available ZTF variable star catalogs. Further work will focus on the development and refinement of a search algorithm to correctly identify these stars in ZTF data and, subsequently, in massive photometric time series databases in general.

Mass limits of the extremely fast-spinning white dwarf CTCV J2056-3014;;CTCV J2056-3014 is a nearby cataclysmic variable with an orbital period of approximately 1.76 h at a distance of about 853 light-years from the Earth. Its recently reported X-ray properties suggest that J2056-3014 is an unusual accretion-powered intermediate polar that harbors a fast-spinning white dwarf (WD) with a spin period of 29.6 s. The low X-ray luminosity and the relatively modest accretion rate per unit area suggest that the shock is not occurring near the WD surface. It has been argued that, under these conditions, the maximum temperature of the shock cannot be directly used to determine the mass of the WD (which, under the abovementioned assumptions, would be around 0.46 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). Here, we explore the stability of this rapidly rotating WD using a modern equation of state (EoS) that accounts for electron-ion, electron-electron, and ion-ion interactions. For this EoS, we determine the mass density thresholds for the onset of pycnonuclear fusion reactions and study the impact of microscopic stability and rapid rotation on the structure and stability of WDs, considering them with helium, carbon, oxygen, and neon. From this analysis, we obtain a minimum mass for CTCV J2056-3014 of 0.56 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a maximum mass of around 1.38 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. If the mass of CTCV J2056-3014 is close to the lower mass limit, its equatorial radius would be on the order of 10<SUP>4</SUP> km due to rapid rotation. Such a radius is significantly larger than that of a nonrotating WD of average mass (0.6 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), which is on the order of 7 × 10<SUP>3</SUP> km. The effects on the minimum mass of J2056-3014 due to changes in the temperature and composition of the stellar matter were found to be negligibly small.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...656A..77O
Different to the core: The pre-supernova structures of massive single and binary-stripped stars;;The majority of massive stars live in binary or multiple systems and will interact with a companion during their lifetimes, which helps to explain the observed diversity of core-collapse supernovae. Donor stars in binary systems can lose most of their hydrogen-rich envelopes through mass transfer. As a result, not only are the surface properties affected, but so is the core structure. However, most calculations of the core-collapse properties of massive stars rely on single-star models. We present a systematic study of the difference between the pre-supernova structures of single stars and stars of the same initial mass (11-21 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) that have been stripped due to stable post-main-sequence mass transfer at solar metallicity. We present the pre-supernova core composition with novel diagrams that give an intuitive representation of the isotope distribution. As shown in previous studies, at the edge of the carbon-oxygen core, the binary-stripped star models contain an extended gradient of carbon, oxygen, and neon. This layer remains until core collapse and is more extended in mass for higher initial stellar masses. It originates from the receding of the convective helium core during core helium burning in binary-stripped stars, which does not occur in single-star models. We find that this same evolutionary phase leads to systematic differences in the final density and nuclear energy generation profiles. Binary-stripped star models have systematically higher total masses of carbon at the moment of core collapse compared to single-star models, which likely results in systematically different supernova yields. In about half of our models, the silicon-burning and oxygen-rich layers merge after core silicon burning. We discuss the implications of our findings for the "explodability", supernova observations, and nucleosynthesis of these stars. Our models are publicly available and can be readily used as input for detailed supernova simulations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...656A..58L
Contribution of flares from tidal disruptions of stars to high-redshift AGN;;We explore the contribution of tidal disruption events (TDEs) to the flares in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at high redshifts. Using the latest data available from X-ray and optical observations of high-redshift galaxies, in combination with the evolution of their central supermassive black holes, we calculate the contribution of TDE to AGNs as a function of their luminosities. We find that at low redshifts (z < 1), a few percent of all AGN with bolometric luminosities L<SUB>Bol</SUB> ≲ 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>−1</SUP> may be attributable to possible TDEs. However, this fraction can significantly increase at earlier cosmic times, including up to several tens of percent of the population of AGN at z ≳ 3. TDEs may comprise a significant fraction of the Compton-Thick AGN population at z ≳ 3. The above findings motivate further calibrations with upcoming X-ray missions and spectroscopic surveys targeting TDE-AGN.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...656A..47P
Variable stars in the 50BiN open cluster survey. II. NGC 869;;This work presents a time-series photometric variability survey of the young open cluster NGC 869. More than 13 000 CCD frames in the BV filters were collected on 19 nights between 2014 November 6 and 2014 December 24. In a 20' × 20' field centered on the cluster, we detected a total of 28 stars showing photometric variability, 12 of which are new discoveries. The classifications and memberships of the variable stars are discussed according to the behaviors and periods of the light curves as well as their positions on the H-R diagram. These results conclude that 22 variable stars are probable members of the cluster while six other stars belong to the field star population. They are categorized as 18 pulsating variable stars (four β Cep, seven SPB, one β Cep / SPB, four Be stars, and two δ Sct / γ Dor candidates), seven eclipsing binaries (five EA and two EB) and three unknown type stars.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021RAA....21..227Z
Searching for axionlike particles from core-collapse supernovae with Fermi LAT's low-energy technique;;Light axionlike particles (ALPs) are expected to be abundantly produced in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), resulting in a ∼10 -second long burst of ALPs. These particles subsequently undergo conversion into gamma rays in external magnetic fields to produce a long gamma-ray burst (GRB) with a characteristic spectrum peaking in the 30-100-MeV energy range. At the same time, CCSNe are invoked as progenitors of ordinary long GRBs, rendering it relevant to conduct a comprehensive search for ALP spectral signatures using the observations of long GRBs with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). We perform a data-driven sensitivity analysis to determine CCSN distances for which a detection of an ALP signal is possible with the LAT's low-energy technique which, in contrast to the standard LAT analysis, allows for a a larger effective area for energies down to 30 MeV. Assuming an ALP mass m<SUB>a</SUB>≲10<SUP>-10</SUP> eV and ALP-photon coupling g<SUB>a γ</SUB>=5.3 ×10<SUP>-12</SUP> GeV<SUP>-1</SUP> , values considered and deduced in ALP searches from SN1987A, we find that the distance limit ranges from ∼0.5 to ∼10 Mpc , depending on the sky location and the CCSN progenitor mass. Furthermore, we select a candidate sample of 24 GRBs and carry out a model comparison analysis in which we consider different GRB spectral models with and without an ALP signal component. We find that the inclusion of an ALP contribution does not result in any statistically significant improvement of the fits to the data. We discuss the statistical method used in our analysis and the underlying physical assumptions, the feasibility of setting upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling, and give an outlook on future telescopes in the context of ALP searches.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PhRvD.104j3001C
A colour portrait of the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov;;The aim of this paper is to report on the results of a multicolour observing campaign performed at the LBT on the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov during three epochs while target was approaching its perihelion: UBVRI images have been observed in October and December 2019, when the comet was at ∼2.3 and 2.0 au from the Sun, respectively. Comet Borisov presented a rather complex morphology, especially in the December observing epoch, when a bi-lobate structure on a global scale was visible, with a jet-like structure characterised by a disconnection event, probably due to the presence of an active area on the nucleus' surface combined with its rotational properties. U - B colour, measured for the first time for this comet, monotonically decreases as Borisov approaches perihelion, from 0.35 ± 0.05 in October 19th to -0.07 ± 0.05 in December 2nd; B - V colour shows a more chaotic behaviour, with values for October epochs quite similar to solar colours, and a higher value of 0.76 ± 0.04 in December 2nd, probably due to a combination of an increase of the B flux (CN emission) and of an increase in V flux (due to C<SUB>2</SUB>). V - R and R-I colours derived in both the October and December observing epochs depict a scenario of a coma slightly redder than the Sun, with a RI-reddening value of ∼11%/1000 Å and ∼5%/1000 Å, respectively. The R- Afρ at the reference aperture of r ∼10<SUP>4</SUP> km from the optocentre slightly decreases from ∼100 cm (October) to ∼ 70 cm (December), showing that the Borisov's dust environment is quite similar to those of Short Period Comets of our Solar System. The application of a first-order photometric model, with the plausible scenario of grains with radius a = 100 μm and bulk density ρ<SUB>d</SUB> = 1000 kg/m<SUP>3</SUP> moving at v<SUB>d</SUB> in the range of 3-30 m/s, allows to derive a dust production rate Q<SUB>d</SUB> decrease from a range of 3-25 kg/s in October to a range of 2-18 kg/s in December. 

All these results confirm that the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov has a coma environment quite similar to that of the Short Period Comets (mostly Jupiter Family targets) orbiting in our inner Solar System.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021P&SS..20805341M
Application of the principal components analysis technique to optical fiber sensors for acetone detection;;Generally, the data analysis of sensors based on spectral measurements, for instance, fiber Bragg gratings (FBG), long period fiber gratings (LPFG) is performed observing the shift or attenuation of a single wavelength. However, sometimes such spectrum variations are not evident or clearly perceptible; therefore, it becomes necessary to use other analysis techniques. One of them is principal components analysis (PCA) which allows to explore the behavior of the complete transmission spectrum pattern. In this work, we show the application of PCA to the response of fiber optical sensors for acetone detection. Two kinds of acetone sensors based upon single long period fiber gratings (LPFG) and Mach-Zehnder fiber interferometers (MZI), formed with a pair of cascaded LPFGs, coated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) were developed. The sensor response was measured inside a Teflon chamber injecting a liquid acetone sample. The transmission spectrum variations at the devices output were measured with an optical spectrum analyzer, stored in a computer and analyzed by PCA. A comparison between the performance of both kinds of sensors was carried out and it was found that the sensitivity was increased up to 13 times (from 0.7 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> ppm<SUP>-1</SUP> to 9.4 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> ppm<SUP>-1</SUP>) for the MZI sensors compared with that of single LPFG ones, which means, at best, a limit of detection (LOD) of 170 ppm.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021OptLT.14307314R
Ultra Fast Astronomy: Optimized Detection of Multimessenger Transients;;Ultra Fast Astronomy is a new frontier becoming enabled by improved detector technology allowing discovery of optical transients on millisecond to nanosecond time scales. These may reveal counterparts of energetic processes such as fast radio bursts, gamma ray bursts, gravitational wave events, or play a role in the optical search for extraterrestrial intelligence (oSETI). We explore some example science cases and their optimization under constrained resources, basically how to distribute observations along the spectrum of short duration searches of many targets or long searches over fewer targets. As a demonstration of the method we present some analytic and some numerical optimizations, of both raw detections and science characterization such as an information matrix analysis of constraining a burst delay - flash duration relation.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021OJAp....4E..14D
Spectral separation of the stochastic gravitational-wave background for LISA in the context of a modulated Galactic foreground;;Within its observational band the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, LISA, will simultaneously observe orbital modulated waveforms from Galactic white dwarf binaries, a binary black hole produced gravitational-wave background, and potentially a cosmologically created stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB). The overwhelming majority of stars end their lives as white dwarfs, making them very numerous in the Milky Way. We simulate Galactic white dwarf binary gravitational-wave emission based on distributions from various mock catalogues and determine a complex waveform from the Galactic foreground with 3.5 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> binaries. We describe the effects from the Galactic binary distribution population across mass, position within the Galaxy, core type, and orbital frequency distribution. We generate the modulated Galactic white dwarf signal detected by LISA due to its orbital motion, and present a data analysis strategy to address it. The Fisher Information and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods give an estimation of the LISA noise and the parameters for the different signal classes. We estimate the detectable limits for the future LISA observation of the SGWB in the spectral domain with the three LISA channels A, E, and T. We simultaneously estimate the Galactic foreground, the astrophysical and cosmological backgrounds. Assuming the expected astrophysical background and a Galactic foreground, a cosmological background energy density of around Ω<SUB>GW,cosmo</SUB> ≈ 8 × 10<SUP>-13</SUP> could be detected by LISA. LISA will either detect a cosmologically produced SGWB, or set a limit that will have important consequences.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508..803B

Searching for Fermi GRB optical counterparts with the prototype Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO);;The typical detection rate of ~1 gamma-ray burst (GRB) per day by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) provides a valuable opportunity to further our understanding of GRB physics. However, the large uncertainty of the Fermi localization typically prevents rapid identification of multiwavelength counterparts. We report the follow-up of 93 Fermi GRBs with the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) prototype on La Palma. We selected 53 events (based on favourable observing conditions) for detailed analysis, and to demonstrate our strategy of searching for optical counterparts. We apply a filtering process consisting of both automated and manual steps to 60 085 candidates initially, rejecting all but 29, arising from 15 events. With ≈3 GRB afterglows expected to be detectable with GOTO from our sample, most of the candidates are unlikely to be related to the GRBs. Since we did not have multiple observations for those candidates, we cannot confidently confirm the association between the transients and the GRBs. Our results show that GOTO can effectively search for GRB optical counterparts thanks to its large field of view of ≈40 deg<SUP>2</SUP> and its depth of ≈20 mag. We also detail several methods to improve our overall performance for future follow-up programmes of Fermi GRBs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507.5463M
Deep co-added sky from Catalina Sky Survey images;;A number of synoptic sky surveys are underway or being planned. Typically, they are done with small telescopes and relatively short exposure times. A search for transient or variable sources involves comparison with deeper baseline images, ideally obtained through the same telescope and camera. With that in mind, we have stacked images from the 0.68 m Schmidt telescope on Mt. Bigelow taken over 10 yr as part of the Catalina Sky Survey. In order to generate deep reference images for the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS), close to 0.8 million images over 8000 fields and covering over 27 000 sq. deg have gone into the deep stack that goes up to 3 mag deeper than individual images. CRTS system does not use a filter in imaging; hence, there is no standard passband in which the optical magnitude is measured. We estimate depth by comparing these wide-band unfiltered co-added images with images in the g band and find that the image depth ranges from 22.0 to 24.2 across the sky, with a 200-image stack attaining an equivalent AB magnitude sensitivity of 22.8. We compared various state-of-the-art software packages for co-adding astronomical images and have used SWARP for the stacking. We describe here the details of the process adopted. This methodology may be useful in other panoramic imaging applications, and to other surveys as well. The stacked images are available through a server at Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507.4983S
Very Large Array imaging rules out precessing radio jets in three DES-SDSS-selected candidate periodic quasars;;Periodic quasars have been suggested as candidates for hosting binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs), although alternative scenarios remain possible to explain the optical light-curve periodicity. To test the alternative hypothesis of precessing radio jet, we present deep 6 GHz radio imaging conducted with NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in its C configuration for the three candidate periodic quasars, DES J024703.24-010032.0, DES J024944.66-000036.8, and DES J025214.67-002813.7. Our targets were selected based on their optical variability using 20 yr long multicolour light curves from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The new VLA observations show that all three periodic quasars are radio-quiet with the radio loudness parameters measured to be $R\equiv f_{6\, {\rm cm}}/f_{{\rm 2500}}$ of ≲1.0-1.5 and the k-corrected luminosities νL<SUB>ν</SUB>[6 GHz] of ≲5-21 × 10<SUP>39</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. They are in stark contrast to previously known periodic quasars proposed as binary SMBH candidates such as the blazar OJ 287 and PG1302-102. Our results rule out optical emission contributed from precessing radio jets as the origin of the optical periodicity in the three DES-SDSS-selected candidate periodic quasars. Future continued optical monitoring and complementary multiwavelength observations are still needed to further test the binary SMBH hypothesis as well as other competing scenarios to explain the optical periodicity.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507.4638C
An instantaneous metal organic framework to prepare ultra-high pore volume porous carbon for lithium ion capacitors;;The wide application of lithium ion capacitors (LICs) is now seriously limited by the complex synthesis process of cathode carbon with a demand for high capacity. In this study, a metal organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived porous carbon with super large porous volume (3.504 cm<SUP>3</SUP> g<SUP>-1</SUP>) and specific surface area (3132 m<SUP>2</SUP> g<SUP>-1</SUP>) is obtained by carbonization at a reasonable temperature and acid pickling. The MOF can be facilely and efficiently synthesized by the coprecipitation method (for a few seconds) in deionized water from fluorine-containing organic precursors and zinc-based salts. Moreover, benefiting from the reasonable graphitization and optimized O doping, the porous carbon has a high specific capacity (123.4 mAh g<SUP>-1</SUP>) and excellent cycling stability (10000 cycles) in a half-cell with organic electrolyte. The porous carbon was also used as the cathode in LICs devices with the sucrose hard carbon as an anode. The LICs devices can possess an energy density of 157 Wh kg<SUP>-1</SUP> and a power density of 40 KW kg<SUP>-1</SUP>, as well as the the capacities remain ~ 85% after 4000 cycles. This preparation method of ultra-high pore volume MOFs-derived carbon and high-performance LICs devices can provide a unique pathway toward the more advanced energy storage equipment.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApSS..56550528X
Physical Characterization of Main-belt Comet (248370) 2005 QN<SUB>173</SUB>;;We report results from new and archival observations of the newly discovered active asteroid (248370) 2005 QN<SUB>173</SUB> (also now designated Comet 433P), which has been determined to be a likely main-belt comet based on a subsequent discovery that it is recurrently active near perihelion. From archival data analysis, we estimate $g^{\prime} $ -, $r^{\prime} $ -, $i^{\prime} $ -, and $z^{\prime} $ -band absolute magnitudes for the nucleus of H<SUB>g</SUB> = 16.62 ± 0.13, H<SUB>r</SUB> = 16.12 ± 0.10, H<SUB>i</SUB> = 16.05 ± 0.11, and H<SUB>z</SUB> = 15.93 ± 0.08, corresponding to nucleus colors of $g^{\prime} -r^{\prime} =0.50\pm 0.16$ , $r^{\prime} -i^{\prime} =0.07\pm 0.15$ , and $i^{\prime} -z^{\prime} =0.12\pm 0.14$ ; an equivalent V-band absolute magnitude of H<SUB>V</SUB> = 16.32 ± 0.08; and a nucleus radius of r<SUB>n</SUB> = 1.6 ± 0.2 km (using a V-band albedo of p<SUB>V</SUB> = 0.054 ± 0.012). Meanwhile, we find mean near-nucleus coma colors when 248370 is active of $g^{\prime} -r^{\prime} =0.47\pm 0.03$ , $r^{\prime} -i^{\prime} =0.10\pm 0.04$ , and $i^{\prime} -z^{\prime} =0.05\pm 0.05$ and similar mean dust tail colors, suggesting that no significant gas coma is present. We find approximate ratios between the scattering cross sections of near-nucleus dust (within 5000 km of the nucleus) and the nucleus of A<SUB>d</SUB>/A<SUB>n</SUB> = 0.7 ± 0.3 on 2016 July 22 and 1.8 < A<SUB>d</SUB>/A<SUB>n</SUB> < 2.9 in 2021 July and August. During the 2021 observation period, the coma declined in intrinsic brightness by ~0.35 mag (or ~25%) in 37 days, while the surface brightness of the dust tail remained effectively constant over the same period. Constraints derived from the sunward extent of the coma and width of the tail as measured perpendicular to the orbit plane suggest that the terminal velocities of ejected dust grains are extremely slow (~1 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> for 1 μm particles), suggesting that the observed dust emission may be aided by rapid rotation of the nucleus lowering the effective escape velocity.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922L...9H
Recurrent Activity from Active Asteroid (248370) 2005 QN<SUB>173</SUB>: A Main-belt Comet;;We present archival observations of main-belt asteroid (248370) 2005 QN<SUB>173</SUB> (also designated 433P) that demonstrate this recently discovered active asteroid (a body with a dynamically asteroidal orbit displaying a tail or coma) has had at least one additional apparition of activity near perihelion during a prior orbit. We discovered evidence of this second activity epoch in an image captured 2016 July 22 with the DECam on the 4 m Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. As of this writing, (248370) 2005 QN<SUB>173</SUB> is just the eighth active asteroid demonstrated to undergo recurrent activity near perihelion. Our analyses demonstrate (248370) 2005 QN<SUB>173</SUB> is likely a member of the active asteroid subset known as main-belt comets, a group of objects that orbit in the main asteroid belt that exhibit activity that is specifically driven by sublimation. We implement an activity detection technique, wedge photometry, that has the potential to detect tails in images of solar system objects and quantify their agreement with computed antisolar and antimotion vectors normally associated with observed tail directions. We present a catalog and an image gallery of archival observations. The object will soon become unobservable as it passes behind the Sun as seen from Earth, and when it again becomes visible (late 2022) it will be farther than 3 au from the Sun. Our findings suggest (248370) 2005 QN<SUB>173</SUB> is most active interior to 2.7 au (0.3 au from perihelion), so we encourage the community to observe and study this special object before 2021 December.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922L...8C
Unexpected Short-period Variability in Dwarf Carbon Stars from the Zwicky Transient Facility;;Dwarf carbon (dC) stars, main-sequence stars showing carbon molecular bands, are enriched by mass transfer from a previous asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) companion, which has since evolved to a white dwarf. While previous studies have found radial-velocity variations for large samples of dCs, there are still relatively few dC orbital periods in the literature and no dC eclipsing binaries have yet been found. Here, we analyze photometric light curves from DR5 of the Zwicky Transient Facility for a sample of 944 dC stars. From these light curves, we identify 34 periodically variable dC stars. Remarkably, of the periodic dCs, 82% have periods less than two days. We also provide spectroscopic follow-up for four of these periodic systems, measuring radial velocity variations in three of them. Short-period dCs are almost certainly post-common-envelope binary systems, because the periodicity is most likely related to the orbital period, with tidally locked rotation and photometric modulation on the dC either from spots or from ellipsoidal variations. We discuss evolutionary scenarios that these binaries may have taken to accrete sufficient C-rich material while avoiding truncation of the thermally pulsing AGB phase needed to provide such material in the first place. We compare these dCs to common-envelope models to show that dC stars probably cannot accrete enough C-rich material during the common-envelope phase, suggesting another mechanism like wind-Roche lobe overflow is necessary. The periodic dCs in this paper represent a prime sample for spectroscopic follow-up and for comparison to future models of wind-Roche lobe overflow mass transfer.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922...33R
Circumstellar Medium Constraints on the Environment of Two Nearby Type Ia Supernovae: SN 2017cbv and SN 2020nlb;;We present deep Chandra X-ray observations of two nearby Type Ia supernovae, SN 2017cbv and SN 2020nlb, which reveal no X-ray emission down to a luminosity L<SUB>X</SUB> ≲ 5.3 × 10<SUP>37</SUP> and ≲ 5.4 × 10<SUP>37</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> (0.3-10 keV), respectively, at ~16-18 days after the explosion. With these limits, we constrain the pre-explosion mass-loss rate of the progenitor system to be $\dot{M}$ < 7.2 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP> and < 9.7 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for each (at a wind velocity v<SUB>w</SUB> = 100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and a radius of R ≈ 10<SUP>16</SUP> cm), assuming any X-ray emission would originate from inverse Compton emission from optical photons upscattered by the supernova shock. If the supernova environment was a constant-density medium, we would find a number density limit of n<SUB>CSM</SUB> < 36 and < 65 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, respectively. These X-ray limits rule out all plausible symbiotic progenitor systems, as well as large swathes of parameter space associated with the single degenerate scenario, such as mass loss at the outer Lagrange point and accretion winds. We also present late-time optical spectroscopy of SN 2020nlb, and set strong limits on any swept up hydrogen (L<SUB>Hα</SUB> < 2.7 × 10<SUP>37</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) and helium (L<SUB>He,λ6678</SUB> < 2.7 × 10<SUP>37</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) from a nondegenerate companion, corresponding to M<SUB>H</SUB> ≲ 0.7-2 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and M<SUB>He</SUB> ≲ 4 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Radio observations of SN 2020nlb at 14.6 days after explosion also yield a non-detection, ruling out most plausible symbiotic progenitor systems. While we have doubled the sample of normal Type Ia supernovae with deep X-ray limits, more observations are needed to sample the full range of luminosities and subtypes of these explosions, and set statistical constraints on their circumbinary environments.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922...21S
Discovery of a 310 Day Period from the Enshrouded Massive System NaSt1 (WR 122);;We present optical and infrared (IR) light curves of NaSt1, also known as Wolf-Rayet 122, with observations from Palomar Gattini-IR (PGIR), the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, and the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). We identify a P = 309.7 ± 0.7 day photometric period from the optical and IR light curves that reveal periodic, sinusoidal variability between 2014 July and 2021 July. We also present historical IR light curves taken between 1983 July and 1989 May, which show variability consistent with the period of the present-day light curves. In the past, NaSt1 was brighter in the J band with larger variability amplitudes than the present-day PGIR values, suggesting that NaSt1 exhibits variability on longer (≳decade) timescales. Sinusoidal fits to the recent optical and IR light curves show that the amplitude of NaSt1's variability differs at various wavelengths and also reveal significant phase offsets of 17.0 ± 2.5 day between the ZTF r and PGIR J light curves. We interpret the 310 day photometric period from NaSt1 as the orbital period of an enshrouded massive binary. We suggest that the photometric variability of NaSt1 may arise from variations in the line-of-sight optical depth toward circumstellar optical/IR-emitting regions throughout its orbit due to colliding-wind dust formation. We speculate that past mass transfer in NaSt1 may have been triggered by Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) during an eruptive phase of an Ofpe/WN9 star. Lastly, we argue that NaSt1 is no longer undergoing RLOF mass transfer.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922....5L
Faintest of Them All: ZTF 21aaoryiz/SN 2021fcg-Discovery of an Extremely Low Luminosity Type Iax Supernova;;We present the discovery of ZTF 21aaoryiz/SN 2021fcg-an extremely low luminosity Type Iax supernova. SN 2021fcg was discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility in the star-forming galaxy IC0512 at a distance of ≈27 Mpc. It reached a peak absolute magnitude of M<SUB>r</SUB> = -12.66 ± 0.20 mag, making it the least luminous thermonuclear supernova discovered to date. The E(B - V) contribution from the underlying host galaxy is unconstrained. However, even if it were as large as 0.5 mag, the peak absolute magnitude would be M<SUB>r</SUB> = -13.78 ± 0.20 mag-still consistent with being the lowest-luminosity SN. Optical spectra of SN 2021fcg taken at 37 and 65 days post-maximum show strong [Ca II], Ca II, and Na I D emission and several weak [Fe II] emission lines. The [Ca II] emission in the two spectra has extremely low velocities of ≈1300 and 1000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. The spectra very closely resemble those of the very low luminosity Type Iax supernovae SN 2008 ha, SN 2010ae, and SN 2019gsc taken at similar phases. The peak bolometric luminosity of SN 2021fcg is ≈ ${2.5}_{-0.3}^{+1.5}\times {10}^{40}$ erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is a factor of 3 lower than that for SN 2008 ha. The bolometric lightcurve of SN 2021fcg is consistent with a very low ejected nickel mass (M ${}_{\mathrm{Ni}}\approx {0.8}_{-0.5}^{+0.4}\times {10}^{-3}$ M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). The low luminosity and nickel mass of SN 2021fcg pose a challenge to the picture that low-luminosity SNe Iax originate from deflagrations of near-M<SUB>ch</SUB> hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon white dwarfs. Instead, the merger of a carbon-oxygen and oxygen-neon white dwarf is a promising model to explain SN 2021fcg.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...921L...6K
Photometric Variability of the Pre-main-sequence Stars toward the Sh 2-190 Region;;We present the results from our time-series imaging data taken with the 1.3 m Devasthal fast optical telescope and 0.81 m Tenagara telescope in V, R<SUB>c</SUB>, and I<SUB>c</SUB> bands covering an area of ~18'4 × 18'4 toward the star-forming region Sh 2-190. This photometric data helped us to explore the nature of the variability of pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars. We have identified 85 PMS variables, i.e., 37 Class II and 48 Class III sources. Forty-five of the PMS variables show periodicity in their light curves. We show that the stars with thicker disks and envelopes rotate slower and exhibit larger photometric variations compared to their diskless counterparts. This result suggests that rotation of the PMS stars is regulated by the presence of circumstellar disks. We also found that the periods of the stars show a decreasing trend with increasing mass in the range of ~0.5-2.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Our result indicates that most of the variability in Class II sources is ascribed to the presence of a thick disk, while the presence of cool spots on the stellar surface causes the brightness variation in Class III sources. X-ray activities in the PMS stars were found to be at the saturation level reported for the main-sequence stars. The younger counterparts of the PMS variables show less X-ray activity, hinting at a less significant role of a stellar disk in X-ray generation.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...921..165S
No Detectable Kilonova Counterpart is Expected for O3 Neutron Star-Black Hole Candidates;;We analyze the tidal disruption probability of potential neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger gravitational-wave (GW) events, including GW190426_152155, GW190814, GW200105_162426, and GW200115_042309, detected during the third observing run of the LIGO/Virgo Collaboration and the detectability of kilonova emission in connection with these events. The posterior distributions of GW190814 and GW200105_162426 show that they must be plunging events, and hence no kilonova signal is expected from these events. With the stiffest NS equation of state allowed by the constraint of GW170817 taken into account, the probability that GW190426_152155 and GW200115_042309 can make tidal disruption is ~24% and ~3%, respectively. However, the predicted kilonova brightness is too faint to be detected for present follow-up search campaigns, which explains the lack of electromagnetic (EM) counterpart detection after triggers of these GW events. Based on the best-constrained population synthesis simulation results, we find that disrupted events account for only ≲20% of cosmological NSBH mergers, since most of the primary BHs could have low spins. The associated kilonovae for those disrupted events will still be difficult for LSST to discover after GW triggers in the future because of their low brightness and larger distances. For future GW-triggered multimessenger observations, potential short-duration gamma-ray bursts and afterglows are more probable EM counterparts of NSBH GW events.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...921..156Z
A Pixon-based Method for Reverberation-mapping Analysis in Active Galactic Nuclei;;We present an alternative method for reconstructing a velocity-delay map in reverberation mapping (RM) based on the pixon algorithm initially proposed for image reconstruction by Pina. The pixon algorithm allows for a variable pixon basis to adjust resolution of each image pixel according to the information content in that pixel, which therefore enables the algorithm to make the best possible use of measured data. The final optimal pixon basis functions would be those that minimize the number of pixons while still providing acceptable descriptions to data within the accuracy allowed by noises. We adapt the pixon algorithm to RM analysis and develop a generic framework to implement the algorithm. Simulation tests and comparisons with the widely used maximum entropy method demonstrate the feasibility and high performance of our pixon-based RM analysis. This paper serves as an introduction to the framework and the application to velocity-unresolved RM. An extension to velocity-resolved cases will be presented in a companion paper.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...921..151L
Exploring the Stellar Rotation of Early-type Stars in the LAMOST Medium-resolution Survey. II. Statistics;;Angular momentum is a key property regulating star formation and evolution. However, the physics driving the distribution of the stellar rotation rates of early-type main-sequence stars is as yet poorly understood. Using our catalog of 40,034 early-type stars with homogeneous $v\sin i$ parameters, we review the statistical properties of their stellar rotation rates. We discuss the importance of possible contaminants, including binaries and chemically peculiar stars. Upon correction for projection effects and rectification of the error distribution, we derive the distributions of our sample's equatorial rotation velocities, which show a clear dependence on stellar mass. Stars with masses less than 2.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> exhibit a unimodal distribution, with the peak velocity ratio increasing as stellar mass increases. A bimodal rotation distribution, composed of two branches of slowly and rapidly rotating stars, emerges for more massive stars (M > 2.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). For stars more massive than 3.0 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, the gap between the bifurcated branches becomes prominent. For the first time, we find that metal-poor ([M/H] < -0.2 dex) stars only exhibit a single branch of slow rotators, while metal-rich ([M/H] > 0.2 dex) stars clearly show two branches. The difference could be attributed to unexpectedly high spin-down rates and/or in part strong magnetic fields in the metal-poor subsample.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...921..145S
Ross 19B: An Extremely Cold Companion Discovered via the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 Citizen Science Project;;Through the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 citizen science project, we have identified a wide-separation (~10', ~9900 au projected) substellar companion to the nearby (~17.5 pc), mid-M dwarf Ross 19. We have developed a new formalism for determining chance alignment probabilities based on the BANYAN Σ tool, and find a 100% probability that this is a physically associated pair. Through a detailed examination of Ross 19A, we find that the system is metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -0.40 ± 0.12) with an age of ${7.2}_{-3.6}^{+3.8}$ Gyr. Combining new and existing photometry and astrometry, we find that Ross 19B is one of the coldest known wide-separation companions, with a spectral type on the T/Y boundary, an effective temperature of ${500}_{-100}^{+115}$ K, and a mass in the range 15-40 M<SUB>Jup</SUB>. This new, extremely cold benchmark companion is a compelling target for detailed characterization with future spectroscopic observations using facilities such as the Hubble Space Telescope or James Webb Space Telescope.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...921..140S
Gaia GraL: Gaia DR2 Gravitational Lens Systems. VI. Spectroscopic Confirmation and Modeling of Quadruply Imaged Lensed Quasars;;Combining the exquisite angular resolution of Gaia with optical light curves and WISE photometry, the Gaia Gravitational Lenses group (GraL) uses machine-learning techniques to identify candidate strongly lensed quasars, and has confirmed over two dozen new strongly lensed quasars from the Gaia Data Release 2. This paper reports on the 12 quadruply imaged quasars identified by this effort to date, which is a ~20% increase in the total number of confirmed quadruply imaged quasars. We discuss the candidate selection, spectroscopic follow-up, and lens modeling. We also report our spectroscopic failures as an aid for future investigations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...921...42S
Discovery of deep eclipses in the cataclysmic variable ZTF17aaaeefu (2MASS J00594349+6454419);;I performed photometric observations of the cataclysmic variable candidate ZTF17aaaeefu and discovered very deep eclipses. The observations were obtained over 8 nights covering 7 months. The eclipse profile is similar to the eclipse profiles observed in other cataclysmic variables. During the observations, ZTF17aaaeefu showed brightness changes resembling dwarf nova outbursts and quiescent states. When ZTF17aaaeefu was bright (16.0-16.2 mag), the average eclipse depth was 2.50 ±0.18 mag. When ZTF17aaaeefu was faint (17.2-17.4 mag), the average eclipse depth was 1.45 ±0.06 mag. However, these differences in the eclipse depth may be mainly caused by the contaminating effect of three faint stars around ZTF17aaaeefu. In both cases, the average width of the prominent parts of the eclipses was the same and was about 30 min. Due to the large coverage of observations, I measured the orbital period with high precision, P<SUB>orb</SUB>=0.188 211 55 ±0.000 000 14 d. I derived the eclipse ephemeris, the validity time of which is 700 years in accordance with the precision of the orbital period. This ephemeris can be used for future studies of the orbital period changes. Because ZTF17aaaeefu has a long orbital period, this cataclysmic variable is of interest for determining the masses of its stellar components. In future radial velocity measurements, my precise eclipse ephemeris may be useful for determining the orbital phases.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021Ap&SS.366..111K
Classical Cepheids in the Milky Way;;We share the most up-to-date, carefully verified list of classical Cepheids residing in the Galaxy. Based on long-term OGLE experience in the field of variable stars, we have inspected candidates for Cepheids from surveys such as ASAS, ASAS-SN, ATLAS, Gaia, NSVS, VVV, WISE, ZTF, among others, and also known sources from the General Catalogue of Variable Stars. Only objects confirmed in the optical range as classical Cepheids are included in the list. We provide Gaia EDR3 identifications of the stars. Purity of the sample exceeds 97 per cent, while its completeness is of about 88 per cent down to a magnitude G = 18. The list contains 3352 classical Cepheids, of which 2140 stars are fundamental-mode pulsators. Basic statistics and comparison between the classical Cepheids from the Milky Way, Andromeda Galaxy (M31), and Magellanic Clouds are provided. The list is available at the OGLE Internet Data Archive.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AcA....71..205P
Over 24 000 δ Scuti Stars in the Galactic Bulge and Disk from the OGLE Survey;;We present the largest collection of δ Scuti-type stars in the Milky Way. Together with the recently published OGLE collection of δ Sct variables in the inner Galactic bulge, our sample consists of 24 488 objects distributed along the Milky Way plane, over galactic longitudes ranging from about -170<SUP>o</SUP> to +60<SUP>o</SUP>. The collection data include the I- and V-band time-series photometry collected since 1997 during the OGLE-II, OGLE-III, and OGLE-IV surveys.

Searching for Changing-state AGNs in Massive Data Sets. I. Applying Deep Learning and Anomaly-detection Techniques to Find AGNs with Anomalous Variability Behaviors;;The classic classification scheme for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) was recently challenged by the discovery of the so-called changing-state (changing-look) AGNs. The physical mechanism behind this phenomenon is still a matter of open debate and the samples are too small and of serendipitous nature to provide robust answers. In order to tackle this problem, we need to design methods that are able to detect AGNs right in the act of changing state. Here we present an anomaly-detection technique designed to identify AGN light curves with anomalous behaviors in massive data sets. The main aim of this technique is to identify CSAGN at different stages of the transition, but it can also be used for more general purposes, such as cleaning massive data sets for AGN variability analyses. We used light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility data release 5 (ZTF DR5), containing a sample of 230,451 AGNs of different classes. The ZTF DR5 light curves were modeled with a Variational Recurrent Autoencoder (VRAE) architecture, that allowed us to obtain a set of attributes from the VRAE latent space that describes the general behavior of our sample. These attributes were then used as features for an Isolation Forest (IF) algorithm that is an anomaly detector for a "one class" kind of problem. We used the VRAE reconstruction errors and the IF anomaly score to select a sample of 8809 anomalies. These anomalies are dominated by bogus candidates, but we were able to identify 75 promising CSAGN candidates.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..206S
TESS and ZTF Observations of an Eclipsing Z Cam-type Dwarf Nova IPHAS J051814.34+294113.2;;We present an analysis of both Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations of the eclipsing cataclysmic variable IPHAS J051814.34+294113.2 (IPHAS J0518). The TESS light curve shows numerous eclipses superimposed on two outbursts, and ZTF data show frequently outbursts recurring on average every 20.7 days and 12.9 days for long and short outbursts, respectively. This makes IPHAS J0518 to be identified as a possible Z Cam-type dwarf nova. Its quiescent magnitude is ~16.7 in the g band. The orbital period is determined to be 4.95 hr. By combining the observed orbital period with the semiempirical relations of Knigge et al., we estimate the donor mass as M<SUB>2</SUB> = 0.48M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The eclipse phase measurements are used to constrain the binary parameters. The orbital inclination is limited in the range of 75°3 ≤ i < 81°7, and the mass ratio is derived as 0.33 < q ≤ 0.73. Furthermore, we analysis the accretion disk eclipse and find that the total disk eclipse is possible during quiescence, whereas during outburst the disk would be only partially obscured. This indicates that the disk will become larger as the outburst proceeds. We also study the changes of the eclipse depth against the out-of-eclipse flux in IPHAS J0518. The results show evidence of the expansion in the disk size and the variations in the radial-temperature gradient during outburst.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..205H
The Type II supernova SN 2020jfo in M 61, implications for progenitor system, and explosion dynamics;;We present the discovery and extensive follow-up observations of SN 2020jfo, a Type IIP supernova (SN) in the nearby (14.5 Mpc) galaxy M 61. Optical light curves (LCs) and spectra from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), complemented with data from Swift/UVOT and near-infrared photometry is presented. These were used to model the 350-day duration bolometric light curve, which exhibits a relatively short (∼65 days) plateau. This implies a moderate ejecta mass (∼5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) at the time of explosion, whereas the deduced amount of ejected radioactive nickel is ∼0.025 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. An extensive series of spectroscopy is presented, including spectropolarimetric observations. The nebular spectra are dominated by Hα, but also reveal emission lines from oxygen and calcium. Comparisons to synthetic nebular spectra indicate an initial progenitor mass of ∼12 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We also note the presence of stable nickel in the nebular spectrum, and SN 2020jfo joins a small group of SNe that have inferred super-solar Ni/Fe ratios. Several years of prediscovery data were examined, but no signs of precursor activity were found. Pre-explosion Hubble Space Telescope imaging reveals a probable progenitor star, detected only in the reddest band (M<SUB>F814W</SUB> ≈ −5.8) and it is fainter than expected for stars in the 10−15 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> range. There is thus some tension between the LC analysis, the nebular spectral modeling, and the pre-explosion imaging. To compare and contrast, we present two additional core-collapse SNe monitored by the ZTF, which also have nebular Hα-dominated spectra. This illustrates how the absence or presence of an interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) affect both the LCs and in particular the nebular spectra. Type II SN 2020amv has a LC powered by CSM interaction, in particular after ∼40 days when the LC is bumpy and slowly evolving. The late-time spectra show strong Hα emission with a structure suggesting emission from a thin, dense shell. The evolution of the complex three-horn line profile is reminiscent of that observed for SN 1998S. Finally, SN 2020jfv has a poorly constrained early-time LC, but it is of interest because of the transition from a hydrogen-poor Type IIb to a Type IIn, where the nebular spectrum after the light-curve rebrightening is dominated by Hα, although with an intermediate line width.

A low-energy explosion yields the underluminous Type IIP SN 2020cxd;;Context. We present our observations and analysis of SN 2020cxd, a low-luminosity (LL), long-lived Type IIP supernova (SN). This object is a clear outlier in the magnitude-limited SN sample recently presented by the Zwicky Transient Facility's (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey. 
 Aims: We demonstrate that SN 2020cxd is an additional member of the group of LL SNe and we discuss the rarity of LL SNe in the context of the ZTF survey. We consider how further studies of these faintest members of the core-collapse (CC) SN family might help improve the general understanding of the underlying initial mass function for stars that explode. 
 Methods: We used optical light curves (LCs) from the ZTF in the gri bands and several epochs of ultraviolet data from the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory as well as a sequence of optical spectra. We constructed the colour curves and a bolometric LC. Then we compared the evolution of the ejecta velocity and black-body temperature for LL SNe as well as for typical Type II SNe. Furthermore, we adopted a Monte Carlo code that fits semi-analytic models to the LC of SN 2020cxd, which allows for the estimation of the physical parameters. Using our late-time nebular spectra, we also make a comparison against SN II spectral synthesis models from the literature to constrain the progenitor properties of SN 2020cxd. 
 Results: The LCs of SN 2020cxd show a great similarity with those of LL SNe IIP in terms of luminosity, timescale, and colours. Also, the spectral evolution of SN 2020cxd is that of a Type IIP SN. The spectra show prominent and narrow P-Cygni lines, indicating low expansion velocities. This is one of the faintest LL SNe observed, with an absolute plateau magnitude of M<SUB>r</SUB> = −14.5 mag and also one with the longest plateau lengths, with a duration of 118 days. Finally, the velocities measured from the nebular emission lines are among the lowest ever seen in a SN, with an intrinsic full width at half maximum value of 478 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>. The underluminous late-time exponential LC tail indicates that the mass of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni ejected during the explosion is much smaller than the average of normal SNe IIP, we estimate M<SUB><SUP>56</SUP>Ni</SUB> = 0.003 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The Monte Carlo fitting of the bolometric LC suggests that the progenitor of SN 2020cxd had a radius of R<SUB>0</SUB> = 1.3 × 10<SUP>13</SUP> cm, kinetic energy of E<SUB>kin</SUB> = 4.3 × 10<SUP>50</SUP> erg, and ejecta mass of M<SUB>ej</SUB> = 9.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. From the bolometric LC, we estimated the total radiated energy E<SUB>rad</SUB> = 1.52 × 10<SUP>48</SUP> erg. Using our late-time nebular spectra, we compared these results against SN II spectral synthesis models to constrain the progenitor zero-age main sequence mass and found that it is likely to be ≲15 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. 
 Conclusions: SN 2020cxd is a LL Type IIP SN. The inferred progenitor parameters and the features observed in the nebular spectrum favour a low-energy, Ni-poor, iron CC SN from a low-mass (∼12 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) red supergiant.

Threat from Within: Excitation of Venus's Co-orbital Asteroids to Earth-crossing Orbits;;All five currently known asteroids in the 1:1 mean-motion resonance (co-orbital) with Venus cross Earth's orbit. We explore a scenario in which these near-Earth asteroids originate in a reservoir of asteroids co-orbiting with Venus on low-eccentricity orbits. Such an asteroid reservoir was proposed as the only viable source of Venus's co-orbital dust ring. So far, efforts to discover low-eccentricity Venus co-orbital (LEVCO) asteroids have been unsuccessful; however, their existence has not been ruled out. We show that LEVCO asteroids, stable for millions to billions of years, eventually evolve into Earth-crossing configurations, where they may pose a threat to Earth. We find that the orbits of these asteroids cross Earth's orbit for 22.5 million yr, on average, an order of magnitude longer than the corresponding Earth-crossing time of most asteroids escaping from the main belt. Using the results of the latest survey of LEVCO asteroids, we conclude that, given their absolute magnitudes, H, most of the observed Venus co-orbitals likely do not originate from the hypothetical population of LEVCO asteroids. However, we infer that there are up to ~500 asteroids originating from the LEVCO region with H < 26.3 (10-40 m in diameter) that currently cross the orbit of Earth. Up to ~20 of those have H < 24.1 (30-100 m in diameter), easily detectable by various near-Earth asteroid surveys. We estimate the current mass of the LEVCO reservoir as M ≍ 10<SUP>13</SUP>-10<SUP>16</SUP> kg, 3-6 orders of magnitude lower than the current mass of the main belt, depending on their size-frequency distribution.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PSJ.....2..193P
New candidates for AM Canum Venaticorum stars among ASAS-SN transients;;We studied Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) light curves of 34 dwarf nova candidates discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) between 2020 May 12 and September 9 and found six AM CVn-type candidates. All objects showed short outbursts (post-superoutburst rebrightenings) on the fading tail. Two objects (ASASSN-20eq, ASASSN-20la) showed double superoutbursts. Three objects (ASASSN-20jt, ASASSN-20ke, and ASASSN-20lr) showed short superoutbursts (5-6 d). These features in the light curve can be used in discriminating AM CVn-type candidates from hydrogen-rich systems. In contrast to hydrogen-rich systems, some object did not show red color excess during the rebrightening or fading tail phase. We interpret that this is due to the higher ionization temperature in helium disks. Two objects had long (likely) supercycles: ASASSN-20gx (8.5 yr) and ASASSN-20lr (7 yr). We provide a scheme for identifying AM CVn-type candidates based on the light curve characteristics.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASJ...73.1375K

DDOTI observations of gravitational-wave sources discovered in O3;;We present optical follow-up observations with the Deca-Degree Optical Transient Imager (DDOTI) telescope of gravitational-wave (GW) events detected during the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo O3 observing run. DDOTI is capable of responding to an alert in a few minutes, has an instantaneous field of about 69 deg<SUP>2</SUP>, and obtains 10σ upper limits of w<SUB>lim</SUB> = 18.5-20.5 AB mag in 1000 s of exposure, depending on the conditions. We observed 54 per cent (26 out of 48) of the unretracted GW alerts and did not find any electromagnetic counterparts. We compare our upper limits to various possible counterparts: the kilonova AT 2017gfo, models of radioactive- and magnetar-powered kilonovae, short gamma-ray burst afterglows, and active galactic nucleus (AGN) flares. Although the large positional uncertainties of GW sources do not allow us to place strong constraints during O3, DDOTI observations of well-localized GW events in O4 and beyond could meaningfully constrain models of compact binary mergers. We show that DDOTI is able to detect kilonovae similar to AT 2017gfo up to about 200 Mpc and magnetar-powered kilonovae up to 1 Gpc. We calculate that nearby (≲200 Mpc) afterglows have a high chance (≈70 per cent) to be detected by rapid (≲3 h) DDOTI observations if observed on-axis, whereas off-axis afterglows are unlikely to be seen. Finally, we suggest that long-term monitoring of massive BBH events with DDOTI could confirm or rule out late AGN flares associated with these events.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507.1401B
Swift/UVOT follow-up of gravitational wave alerts in the O3 era;;In this paper, we report on the observational performance of the Swift Ultra-violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) in response to the gravitational wave (GW) alerts announced by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory and the Advanced Virgo detector during the O3 period. We provide the observational strategy for follow-up of GW alerts and provide an overview of the processing and analysis of candidate optical/UV sources. For the O3 period, we also provide a statistical overview and report on serendipitous sources discovered by Swift/UVOT. Swift followed 18 GW candidate alerts, with UVOT observing a total of 424 deg<SUP>2</SUP>. We found 27 sources that changed in magnitude at the 3σ level compared with archival u- or g-band catalogued values. Swift/UVOT also followed up a further 13 sources reported by other facilities during the O3 period. Using catalogue information, we divided these 40 sources into five initial classifications: 11 candidate active galactic nuclei (AGNs)/quasars, three cataclysmic variables (CVs), nine supernovae, 11 unidentified sources that had archival photometry, and six uncatalogued sources for which no archival photometry was available. We have no strong evidence to identify any of these transients as counterparts to the GW events. The 17 unclassified sources are likely a mix of AGN and a class of fast-evolving transient, and one source may be a CV.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507.1296O
Binary evolution pathways of blue large-amplitude pulsators;;Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) are a recently discovered class of pulsating star, believed to be proto-white dwarfs, produced by mass stripping of a red giant when it has a small helium core. An outstanding question is why the stars in this class of pulsator seem to form two distinct groups by surface gravity, despite predictions that stars in the gap between them should also pulsate. We use a binary population synthesis model to identify potential evolutionary pathways that a star can take to become a BLAP. We find that BLAPs can be produced either through common envelope evolution or through Roche lobe overflow, with a main-sequence star or an evolved compact object being responsible for the envelope stripping. The mass distribution of the inferred population indicates that fewer stars would be expected in the range of masses intermediate to the two known groups of pulsators, suggesting that the lack of observational discoveries in this region may be a result of the underlying population of pre-white dwarf stars. We also consider metallicity variation and find evidence that BLAPs at Z = 0.010 (half-solar) would be pulsationally unstable and may also be more common. Based on this analysis, we expect the Milky Way to host around 12 000 BLAPs and we predict the number density of sources expected in future observations such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time at the Vera Rubin Observatory.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507..621B
Simulating a stellar contact binary merger - I. Stellar models;;We study the initial conditions of a common envelope (CE) event resulting in a stellar merger. A merger's dynamics could be understood through its light curve, but no synthetic light curve has yet been created for the full evolution. Using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code STARSMASHER, we have created three-dimensional (3D) models of a 1.52 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> star that is a plausible donor in the V1309 Sco progenitor. The integrated total energy profiles of our 3D models match their initial one-dimensional (1D) models to within a 0.1 per cent difference in the top 0.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of their envelopes. We have introduced a new method for obtaining radiative flux by linking intrinsically optically thick SPH particles to a single stellar envelope solution from a set of unique solutions. For the first time, we calculated our 3D models' effective temperatures to within a few per cent of the initial 1D models, and found a corresponding improvement in luminosity by a factor of ≳10<SUP>6</SUP> compared to ray tracing. We let our highest resolution 3D model undergo Roche lobe overflow with a 0.16 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> point-mass accretor (P ≃ 1.6 d) and found a bolometric magnitude variability amplitude of ~0.3 - comparable to that of the V1309 Sco progenitor. Our 3D models are, in the top 0.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of the envelope and in terms of total energy, the most accurate models so far of the V1309 Sco donor star. A dynamical simulation that uses the initial conditions we presented in this paper can be used to create the first ever synthetic CE evolution light curve.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507..385H
Predicting the self-lensing population in optical surveys;;The vast majority of binaries containing a compact object and a regular star spend most of their time in a quiescent state where no strong interactions occur between components. Detection of these binaries is extremely challenging and only few candidates have been detected through optical spectroscopy. Self-lensing represents a new means of detecting compact objects in binaries, where gravitational lensing of the light from the visible component by the compact object produces periodic optical flares. Here we show that current and planned large-area optical surveys can detect a significant number (~100-10 000s) of these self-lensing binaries and provide insights into the properties of the compact lenses. We show that many of the predicted population of observable self-lensing binaries will be observed with multiple self-lensing flares; this both improves the chances of detection and also immediately distinguishes them from chance-alignment micro-lensing events. Through self-lensing we can investigate long - but previously hidden - stages of binary evolution and consequently provide new constraints on evolutionary models that impact the number and nature of double compact object mergers.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507..374W
HiPERCAM: a quintuple-beam, high-speed optical imager on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias;;HiPERCAM is a portable, quintuple-beam optical imager that saw first light on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) in 2018. The instrument uses re-imaging optics and four dichroic beamsplitters to record $u_{\rm s}\, g_{\rm s}\, r_{\rm s}\, i_{\rm s}\, z_{\rm s}$ (320-1060 nm) images simultaneously on its five CCD cameras, each of 3.1-arcmin (diagonal) field of view. The detectors in HiPERCAM are frame-transfer devices cooled thermo-electrically to 183 K, thereby allowing both long-exposure, deep imaging of faint targets, as well as high-speed (over 1000 windowed frames per second) imaging of rapidly varying targets. A comparison-star pick-off system in the telescope focal plane increases the effective field of view to 6.7 arcmin for differential photometry. Combining HiPERCAM with the world's largest optical telescope enables the detection of astronomical sources to g<SUB>s</SUB> ~ 23 in 1 s and g<SUB>s</SUB> ~ 28 in 1 h. In this paper, we describe the scientific motivation behind HiPERCAM, present its design, report on its measured performance, and outline some planned enhancements.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507..350D
A survey for variable young stars with small telescopes - IV. Rotation periods of YSOs in IC 5070;;Studying rotational variability of young stars is enabling us to investigate a multitude of properties of young star-disc systems. We utilize high cadence, multiwavelength optical time series data from the Hunting Outbursting Young Stars citizen science project to identify periodic variables in the Pelican Nebula (IC 5070). A double blind study using nine different period-finding algorithms was conducted and a sample of 59 periodic variables was identified. We find that a combination of four period finding algorithms can achieve a completeness of 85 per cent and a contamination of 30 per cent in identifying periods in inhomogeneous data sets. The best performing methods are periodograms that rely on fitting a sine curve. Utilizing Gaia EDR3 data, we have identified an unbiased sample of 40 periodic young stellar objects (YSOs), without using any colour or magnitude selections. With a 98.9 per cent probability, we can exclude a homogeneous YSO period distribution. Instead, we find a bi-modal distribution with peaks at 3 and 8 d. The sample has a disc fraction of 50 per cent, and its statistical properties are in agreement with other similarly aged YSOs populations. In particular, we confirm that the presence of the disc is linked to predominantly slow rotation and find a probability of 4.8 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> that the observed relation between period and presence of a disc has occurred by chance. In our sample of periodic variables, we also find pulsating giants, an eclipsing binary, and potential YSOs in the foreground of IC 5070.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.5989F
Carbon-enhanced stars with short orbital and spin periods;;Many characteristics of dwarf carbon stars are broadly consistent with a binary origin, including mass transfer from an evolved companion. While the population overall appears to have old-disc or halo kinematics, roughly 2 per cent of these stars exhibit Hα emission, which in low-mass main-sequence stars is generally associated with rotation and relative youth. Its presence in an older population therefore suggests either irradiation or spin-up. This study presents time-series analyses of photometric and radial-velocity data for seven dwarf carbon stars with Hα emission. All are shown to have photometric periods in the range 0.2-5.2 d, and orbital periods of similar length, consistent with tidal synchronization. It is hypothesized that dwarf carbon stars with emission lines are the result of close-binary evolution, indicating that low-mass, metal-weak, or metal-poor stars can accrete substantial material prior to entering a common-envelope phase.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.4877W
A systematic reclassification of Type IIn supernovae;;Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are a relatively infrequently observed subclass of SNe whose photometric and spectroscopic properties are varied. A common thread among SNe IIn is the complex multiple-component hydrogen Balmer lines. Owing to the heterogeneity of SNe IIn, online data bases contain some outdated, erroneous, or even contradictory classifications. SN IIn classification is further complicated by SN 'impostors' and contamination from underlying H II regions. We have compiled a catalogue of systematically classified nearby (redshift z < 0.02) SNe IIn using the Open Supernova Catalogue (OSC). We present spectral classifications for 115 objects previously classified as SNe IIn. Our classification is based on results obtained by fitting multiple Gaussians to the H α profiles. We compare classifications reported by the OSC and Transient Name Server (TNS) along with the best matched templates from SNID . We find that 28 objects have been misclassified as SNe IIn. TNS and OSC can be unreliable; they disagree on the classifications of 51 of the objects and contain a number of erroneous classifications. Furthermore, OSC and TNS hold misclassifications for 34 and 12 (respectively) of the transients we classify as SNe IIn. In total, we classify 87 SNe IIn. We highlight the importance of ensuring that online data bases remain up to date when new or even contemporaneous data become available. Our work shows the great range of spectral properties and features that SNe IIn exhibit, which may be linked to multiple progenitor channels and environment diversity. We set out a classification scheme for SNe IIn based on the H α profile that is not greatly affected by the inhomogeneity of SNe IIn.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.4715R
Multi-messenger emission from the parsec-scale jet of the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 1502+106 coincident with high-energy neutrino IceCube-190730A;;On July 30th, 2019 IceCube detected a high-energy astrophysical muon neutrino candidate, IC-190730A with a 67% probability of astrophysical origin. The flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) PKS 1502 +106 is in the error circle of the neutrino. Motivated by this observation, we study PKS 1502+106 as a possible source of IC-190730A. PKS 1502+106 was in a quiet state in terms of UV/optical/X-ray/γ-ray flux at the time of the neutrino alert, we therefore model the expected neutrino emission from the source during its average long-term state, and investigate whether the emission of IC-190730A as a result of the quiet long-term emission of PKS 1502+106 is plausible. We analyse UV/optical and X-ray data and collect additional observations from the literature to construct the multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution of PKS 1502+106. We perform leptohadronic modelling of the multi-wavelength emission of the source and determine the most plausible emission scenarios and the maximum expected accompanying neutrino flux. A model in which the multi-wavelength emission of PKS 1502+106 originates beyond the broad-line region and inside the dust torus is most consistent with the observations. In this scenario, PKS 1502+106 can have produced up to of order one muon neutrino with energy exceeding 100 TeV in the lifetime of IceCube. An appealing feature of this model is that the required proton luminosity is consistent with the average required proton luminosity if blazars power the observed ultra-high-energy-cosmic-ray flux and well below the source's Eddington luminosity. If such a model is ubiquitous among FSRQs, additional neutrinos can be expected from other bright sources with energy ≳ 10 PeV.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JCAP...10..082O
Observations of Candidates for Eclipsing Cataclysmic Variables with the RTT-150 Telescope;;We present the results of our photometric and spectroscopic observations. We have studied four cataclysmic variable stars: 2XMM J183251.4-100106, MLS1809017 J224712+461815, MGAB-V330, and MGAB-V410. We have analyzed the observational data and determined the periods of the systems from our photometric data. The object MLS1809017 J224712+461815 has been classified as an SU UMa-type dwarf nova. The remaining three systems are eclipsing ones, with 2XMM J183251.4-100106 and MGAB-V410 showing signatures of polars. At the same time, for MGAB-V410 the orbital period $P_{\textrm{orb}}=2\overset{\textrm{h}}{.}2$ falls into the period gap for cataclysmic variables.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AstL...47..695G
Quantifying Variability of Young Stellar Objects in the Mid-infrared Over 6 Years with the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer;;Variability in young stellar objects (YSOs) can be caused by various time-dependent phenomena associated with star formation, including accretion rates, geometric changes in the circumstellar disks, stochastic hydromagnetic interactions between stellar surfaces and inner-disk edges, reconnections within the stellar magnetosphere, and hot/cold spots on stellar surfaces. We uncover and characterize ~1700 variables from a sample of ~5400 YSOs in nearby low-mass star-forming regions using mid-IR light curves obtained from the 6.5 yr Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer All Sky Survey. The mid-IR variability traces a wide range of dynamical, physical, and geometrical phenomenon. We classify six types of YSO mid-IR variability based on their light curves: secular variability (linear, curved, and periodic) and stochastic variability (burst, drop, and irregular). YSOs in earlier evolutionary stages have higher fractions of variables and higher amplitudes for the variability, with the recurrence timescale of FUor-type outbursts (defined here as ΔW1 or ΔW2 > 1 mag followed by inspection of candidates) of ~1000 yr in the early embedded protostellar phase. Known eruptive young stars and subluminous objects show fractions of variables similar to the fraction (~55%) found in typical protostars, suggesting that these two distinct types are not distinct in variability over the 6.5 yr timescale. Along with brightness variability, we also find a diverse range of secular color variations, which can be attributed to a competitive interplay between the variable accretion luminosity of the central source and the variable extinction by material associated with the accretion process.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...920..132P
A Comprehensive X-Ray Report on AT2019wey;;Here, we present MAXI, Swift, NICER, NuSTAR, and Chandra observations of the X-ray transient AT2019wey (SRGA J043520.9+552226, SRGE J043523.3+552234). From spectral and timing analyses we classify it as a Galactic low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) with a black hole (BH) or neutron star (NS) accretor. AT2019wey stayed in the low/hard state (LHS) from 2019 December to 2020 August 21, and the hard-intermediate state (HIMS) from 2020 August 21 to 2020 November. For the first six months of the LHS, AT2019wey had a flux of ~1 mCrab, and displayed a power-law X-ray spectrum with photon index Γ = 1.8. From 2020 June to August, it brightened to ~20 mCrab. Spectral features characteristic of relativistic reflection became prominent. On 2020 August 21, the source left the "hard line" on the rms-intensity diagram, and transitioned from LHS to HIMS. The thermal disk component became comparable to the power-law component. A low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) was observed. The QPO central frequency increased as the spectrum softened. No evidence of pulsation was detected. We are not able to decisively determine the nature of the accretor (BH or NS). However, the BH option is favored by the position of this source on the Γ-L<SUB>X</SUB>, L<SUB>radio</SUB>-L<SUB>X</SUB>, and L<SUB>opt</SUB>-L<SUB>X</SUB> diagrams. We find the BH candidate XTE J1752-223 to be an analog of AT2019wey. Both systems display outbursts with long plateau phases in the hard states. We conclude by noting the potential of SRG in finding new members of this emerging class of low luminosity and long-duration LMXB outbursts.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...920..121Y
Multi-wavelength Observations of AT2019wey: a New Candidate Black Hole Low-mass X-ray Binary;;AT2019wey (SRGA J043520.9+552226, SRGE J043523.3+552234) is a transient first reported by the ATLAS optical survey in 2019 December. It rose to prominence upon detection, three months later, by the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission in its first all-sky survey. X-ray observations reported in Yao et al. suggest that AT2019wey is a Galactic low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) with a black hole (BH) or neutron star (NS) accretor. Here we present ultraviolet, optical, near-infrared, and radio observations of this object. We show that the companion is a short-period (P ≲ 16 hr) low-mass (<1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) star. We consider AT2019wey to be a candidate BH system since its locations on the L<SUB>radio</SUB>-L<SUB>X</SUB> and L<SUB>opt</SUB>-L<SUB>X</SUB> diagrams are closer to BH binaries than NS binaries. We demonstrate that from 2020 June to August, despite the more than 10 times brightening at radio and X-ray wavelengths, the optical luminosity of AT2019wey only increased by 1.3-1.4 times. We interpret the UV/optical emission before the brightening as thermal emission from a truncated disk in a hot accretion flow and the UV/optical emission after the brightening as reprocessing of the X-ray emission in the outer accretion disk. AT2019wey demonstrates that combining current wide-field optical surveys and SRG provides a way to discover the emerging population of short-period BH LMXB systems with faint X-ray outbursts.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...920..120Y
The Final Fates of Close Hot Subdwarf-White Dwarf Binaries: Mergers Involving He/C/O White Dwarfs and the Formation of Unusual Giant Stars with C/O-Dominated Envelopes;;Recently, a class of Roche-lobe-filling binary systems consisting of hot subdwarf stars and white dwarfs (WDs) with sub-hour periods has been discovered. At present, the hot subdwarf is in a shell He-burning phase and is transferring some of its remaining thin H envelope to its WD companion. As the evolution of the hot subdwarf continues, it is expected to detach, leaving behind a low-mass C/O-core WD secondary with a thick He layer. Then, on a timescale of ~10 Myr, gravitational wave radiation will again bring the systems into contact. If the mass transfer is unstable and results in a merger and a catastrophic thermonuclear explosion is not triggered, it creates a remnant with a C/O-dominated envelope, but one still rich enough in He to support an R Corona Borealis-like shell-burning phase. We present evolutionary calculations of this phase and discuss its potential impact on the cooling of the remnant WD.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...920..110S
A Family Tree of Optical Transients from Narrow-line Seyfert 1 Galaxies;;The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) has discovered five events (0.01 < z < 0.4) belonging to an emerging class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) undergoing smooth, large-amplitude, and rapidly rising flares. This sample consists of several transients initially classified as supernovae with narrow spectral lines. However, upon closer inspection, all of the host galaxies display Balmer lines with FWHM(Hβ) ~ 900-1400 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, characteristic of a narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxy. The transient events are long lived, over 400 days on average in the observed frame. We report UV and X-ray follow-up of the flares and observe persistent UV emission, with two of the five transients detected with luminous X-ray emission, ruling out a supernova interpretation. We compare the properties of this sample to previously reported flaring NLSy1 galaxies and find that they fall into three spectroscopic categories: 1) Balmer line profiles and Fe II complexes typical of NLSy1s, 2) strong He II profiles, and 3) He II profiles including Bowen fluorescence features. The latter are members of the growing class of AGN flares attributed to enhanced accretion reported by Trakhtenbrot et al. We consider physical interpretations in the context of related transients from the literature. For example, two of the sources show high-amplitude rebrightening in the optical, ruling out a simple tidal disruption event scenario for those transients. We conclude that three of the sample belong to the Trakhtenbrot et al. class and two are tidal disruption events in NLSy1s. We also hypothesize as to why NLSy1s are preferentially the sites of such rapid enhanced flaring activity.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...920...56F
Search for Neutrinos from the Tidal Disruption Events AT2019dsg and AT2019fdr with the ANTARES Telescope;;On 2019 October 1, the IceCube Collaboration detected a muon track neutrino with a high probability of being of astrophysical origin, IC191001A. After a few hours, the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2019dsg, observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), was indicated as the most likely counterpart of the IceCube track. More recently, the follow-up campaign of the IceCube alerts by ZTF suggested a second TDE, AT2019fdr, as a promising counterpart of another IceCube muon track candidate, IC200530A, detected on 2020 May 30. Here, these intriguing associations are followed-up by searching for neutrinos in the ANTARES detector from the directions of AT2019dsg and AT2019fdr using a time-integrated approach. As no significant evidence for space clustering is found in the ANTARES data, upper limits on the one-flavor neutrino flux and fluence are set.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...920...50A
Reverberation Mapping of Two Luminous Quasars: The Broad-line Region Structure and Black Hole Mass;;We report the results of a multiyear spectroscopic and photometric monitoring campaign of two luminous quasars, PG 0923+201 and PG 1001+291, both located at the high-luminosity end of the broad-line region (BLR) size-luminosity relation with optical luminosities above 10<SUP>45</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. PG 0923+201 is monitored for the first time, while PG 1001+291 was previously monitored but our campaign has a much longer temporal baseline. We detect time lags of variations of the broad Hβ, Hγ, and Fe II lines with respect to those of the 5100 Å continuum. The velocity-resolved delay map of Hβ in PG 0923+201 indicates a complicated structure with a mix of Keplerian disk-like motion and outflow, and the map of Hβ in PG 1001+291 shows a signature of Keplerian disk-like motion. Assuming a virial factor of f<SUB>BLR</SUB> = 1 and FWHM line widths, we measure the black hole mass to be ${118}_{-16}^{+11}\times {10}^{7}{M}_{\odot }$ for PG 0923+201 and ${3.33}_{-0.54}^{+0.62}\times {10}^{7}{M}_{\odot }$ for PG 1001+291. Their respective accretion rates are estimated to be ${0.21}_{-0.07}^{+0.06}\times {L}_{\mathrm{Edd}}\,{c}^{-2}$ and ${679}_{-227}^{+259}\times {L}_{\mathrm{Edd}}\,{c}^{-2}$ , indicating that PG 0923+201 is a sub-Eddington accretor and PG 1001+291 is a super-Eddington accretor. While the Hβ time lag of PG 0923+201 agrees with the size-luminosity relation, the time lag of PG 1001+291 shows a significant deviation, confirming that in high-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the BLR size depends on both luminosity and Eddington ratio. Black hole mass estimates from single-AGN spectra will be overestimated at high luminosities and redshifts if this effect is not taken into account.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...920....9L
ZTFJ0038+2030: A Long-period Eclipsing White Dwarf and a Substellar Companion;;In a search for eclipsing white dwarfs using the Zwicky Transient Facility lightcurves, we identified a deep eclipsing white dwarf with an orbital period of 10.4 hr and an undetected substellar companion. We obtained high-speed photometry and radial velocity measurements to characterize the system. The white dwarf has a mass of 0.50 ± 0.02 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a temperature of 10,900 ± 200 K. The companion has a mass of 0.059 ± 0.004 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and is a brown dwarf. It has a radius of 0.0783 ± 0.0013 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and is one of the physically smallest transiting brown dwarfs known and likely old, ≳8 Gyr. The ZTF discovery efficiency of substellar objects transiting white dwarfs is limited by the number of epochs and as ZTF continues to collect data we expect to find more of these systems.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...919L..26V
A Bright Ultraviolet Excess in the Transitional 02es-like Type Ia Supernova 2019yvq;;We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type Ia SN 2019yvq, from its discovery ~1 day after explosion to ~100 days after its peak brightness. This SN exhibits several unusual features, most notably an extremely bright UV excess seen within ~5 days of its explosion. As seen in Swift UV data, this early excess outshines its "peak" brightness, making this object more extreme than other supernovae (SNe) with early UV/blue excesses (e.g., iPTF14atg and SN 2017cbv). In addition, it was underluminous M<SUB>B</SUB> = -18.4, relatively quickly declining (Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(B) = 1.37), and shows red colors past its early blue bump. Unusual (although not unprecedented) spectral features include extremely broad-lined and high-velocity Si absorption. Despite obvious differences in peak spectra, we classify SN 2019yvq as a transitional member of the 02es-like subclass due to its similarities in several respects (e.g., color, peak luminosity, peak Ti, and nebular [Ca II]). We model this data set with a variety of published models, including SN ejecta-companion shock interaction and sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (WD) double-detonation models. Radio constraints from the VLA place an upper limit of (4.5-20) × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> on the mass-loss rate from a symbiotic progenitor, which does not exclude a red giant or main-sequence companion. Ultimately, we find that no one model can accurately replicate all aspects of the data set, and further we find that the ubiquity of early excesses in 02es-like SNe Ia requires a progenitor system that is capable of producing isotropic UV flux, ruling out some models for this class of objects.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...919..142B
Radio Observations of an Ordinary Outflow from the Tidal Disruption Event AT2019dsg;;We present detailed radio observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2019dsg, obtained with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and spanning 55-560 days post disruption. We find that the peak brightness of the radio emission increases until ~200 days and subsequently begins to decrease steadily. Using a standard equipartition analysis, including the effects of synchrotron cooling as determined by the joint VLA-ALMA spectral energy distributions, we find that the outflow powering the radio emission is in roughly free expansion with a velocity of ≈0.07 c, while its kinetic energy increases by a factor of about 5 from 55 to 200 days and plateaus at ≈4.4 × 10<SUP>48</SUP> erg thereafter. The ambient density traced by the outflow declines as radius ≈R<SUP>-1.7</SUP> on a scale of ≈(1-4) × 10<SUP>16</SUP> cm (≈6300-25,000 R<SUB>s</SUB>), followed by a steeper decline to ≈7 × 10<SUP>16</SUP> cm (≈44,000 R<SUB>s</SUB>). Allowing for a collimated geometry, we find that to reach even mildly relativistic velocities (Γ = 2) the outflow requires an opening angle of θ<SUB>j</SUB> ≈ 2°, which is narrow even by the standards of gamma-ray burst jets; a truly relativistic outflow requires an unphysically narrow jet. The outflow velocity and kinetic energy in AT2019dsg are typical of previous non-relativistic TDEs, and comparable to those from type Ib/c supernovae, raising doubts about the claimed association with a high-energy neutrino event.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...919..127C
Phase Separation in Ultramassive White Dwarfs;;Ultramassive white dwarfs are extreme endpoints of stellar evolution. Recent findings, such as a missing multi-Gyr cooling delay for a number of ultramassive white dwarfs and a white dwarf with a quasi-Chandrasekhar mass, motivate a better understanding of their evolution. A key process still subject to important uncertainties is the crystallization of their dense cores, which are generally assumed to be constituted of <SUP>16</SUP>O, <SUP>20</SUP>Ne, and a mixture of several trace elements (most notably <SUP>23</SUP>Na and <SUP>24</SUP>Mg). In this work, we use our recently developed Clapeyron integration technique to compute accurate phase diagrams of three-component mixtures relevant to the modeling of O/Ne ultramassive white dwarfs. We show that, unlike the phase separation of <SUP>22</SUP>Ne impurities in C/O cores, the phase separation of <SUP>23</SUP>Na impurities in O/Ne white dwarfs cannot lead to the enrichment of their cores in <SUP>23</SUP>Na via a distillation process. This severely limits the prospect of transporting large quantities of <SUP>23</SUP>Na toward the center of the star, as needed in the white dwarf core-collapse mechanism recently proposed by Caiazzo et al. We also show that despite representing ≈10% of the ionic mixture, <SUP>23</SUP>Na and <SUP>24</SUP>Mg impurities only have a negligible impact on the O/Ne phase diagram, and the two-component O/Ne phase diagram can be safely used in white dwarf evolution codes. We provide analytic fits to our high-accuracy O/Ne phase diagram for implementation in white dwarf models.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...919...87B
On the Use of Field RR Lyrae as Galactic Probes. V. Optical and Radial Velocity Curve Templates;;We collected the largest spectroscopic catalog of RR Lyrae (RRLs) including ≈20,000 high-, medium-, and low-resolution spectra for ≈10,000 RRLs. We provide the analytical forms of radial velocity curve (RVC) templates. These were built using 36 RRLs (31 fundamental-split into three period bins-and five first-overtone pulsators) with well-sampled RVCs based on three groups of metallic lines (Fe, Mg, Na) and four Balmer lines (H<SUB>α</SUB>, H<SUB>β</SUB>, H<SUB>γ</SUB>, H<SUB>δ</SUB>). We tackled the long-standing problem of the reference epoch to anchor light-curve and RVC templates. For the V-band, we found that the residuals of the templates anchored to the phase of the mean magnitude along the rising branch are ~35% to ~45% smaller than those anchored to the phase of maximum light. For the RVC, we used two independent reference epochs for metallic and Balmer lines and we verified that the residuals of the RVC templates anchored to the phase of mean RV are from 30% (metallic lines) up to 45% (Balmer lines) smaller than those anchored to the phase of minimum RV. We validated our RVC templates by using both the single-point and the three phase point approaches. We found that barycentric velocities based on our RVC templates are two to three times more accurate than those available in the literature. We applied the current RVC templates to Balmer lines RVs of RRLs in the globular NGC 3201 collected with MUSE at VLT. We found the cluster barycentric RV of V<SUB>γ</SUB> = 496.89 ± 8.37(error) ± 3.43 (standard deviation) km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which agrees well with literature estimates.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...919...85B
TOI-1749: an M dwarf with a Trio of Planets including a Near-resonant Pair;;We report the discovery of one super-Earth- (TOI-1749b) and two sub-Neptune-sized planets (TOI-1749c and TOI-1749d) transiting an early M dwarf at a distance of 100 pc, which were first identified as planetary candidates using data from the TESS photometric survey. We have followed up this system from the ground by means of multiband transit photometry, adaptive optics imaging, and low-resolution spectroscopy, from which we have validated the planetary nature of the candidates. We find that TOI-1749b, c, and d have orbital periods of 2.39, 4.49, and 9.05 days, and radii of 1.4, 2.1, and 2.5 R<SUB>⊕</SUB>, respectively. We also place 95% confidence upper limits on the masses of 57, 14, and 15 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> for TOI-1749b, c, and d, respectively, from transit timing variations. The periods, sizes, and tentative masses of these planets are in line with a scenario in which all three planets initially had a hydrogen envelope on top of a rocky core, and only the envelope of the innermost planet has been stripped away by photoevaporation and/or core-powered mass-loss mechanisms. These planets are similar to other planetary trios found around M dwarfs, such as TOI-175b,c,d and TOI-270b,c,d, in the sense that the outer pair has a period ratio within 1% of 2. Such a characteristic orbital configuration, in which an additional planet is located interior to a near 2:1 period-ratio pair, is relatively rare around FGK dwarfs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..167F
THOR: An Algorithm for Cadence-independent Asteroid Discovery;;We present "Tracklet-less Heliocentric Orbit Recovery" (THOR), an algorithm for linking of observations of Solar System objects across multiple epochs that does not require intranight tracklets or a predefined cadence of observations within a search window. By sparsely covering regions of interest in the phase space with "test orbits," transforming nearby observations over a few nights into the corotating frame of the test orbit at each epoch, and then performing a generalized Hough transform on the transformed detections followed by orbit determination filtering, candidate clusters of observations belonging to the same objects can be recovered at moderate computational cost and with little to no constraint on cadence. We validate the effectiveness of this approach by running on simulations as well as on real data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Applied to a short, two-week slice of ZTF observations, we demonstrate THOR can recover 97.4% of all previously known and discoverable objects in the targeted (a > 1.7 au) population with five or more observations and with purity between 97.7% and 100%. This includes 10 likely new discoveries, and a recovery of an e ~ 1 comet C/2018 U1 (the comet would have been a ZTF discovery had THOR been running in 2018 when the data were taken). The THOR package and demo Jupyter notebooks are open source and available at https://github.com/moeyensj/thor.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..143M
TOI-532b: The Habitable-zone Planet Finder confirms a Large Super Neptune in the Neptune Desert orbiting a metal-rich M-dwarf host;;We confirm the planetary nature of TOI-532b, using a combination of precise near-infrared radial velocities with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curves, ground-based photometric follow up, and high-contrast imaging. TOI-532 is a faint (J ~ 11.5) metal-rich M dwarf with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3957 ± 69 K and [Fe/H] = 0.38 ± 0.04; it hosts a transiting gaseous planet with a period of ~2.3 days. Joint fitting of the radial velocities with the TESS and ground-based transits reveal a planet with radius of 5.82 ± 0.19 R<SUB>⊕</SUB>, and a mass of ${61.5}_{-9.3}^{+9.7}$ M<SUB>⊕</SUB>. TOI-532b is the largest and most massive super Neptune detected around an M dwarf with both mass and radius measurements, and it bridges the gap between the Neptune-sized planets and the heavier Jovian planets known to orbit M dwarfs. It also follows the previously noted trend between gas giants and host-star metallicity for M-dwarf planets. In addition, it is situated at the edge of the Neptune desert in the Radius-Insolation plane, helping place constraints on the mechanisms responsible for sculpting this region of planetary parameter space.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..135K
Identifying Periodic Variable Stars and Eclipsing Binary Systems with Long-term Las Cumbres Observatory Photometric Monitoring of ZTF J0139+5245;;We present the results of our search for variable stars using the long-term Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) monitoring of white dwarf ZTF J0139+5245 with the two 1.0 m telescope nodes located at McDonald Observatory using the Sinistro imaging instrument. In this search, we find 38 variable sources, of which 27 are newly discovered or newly classified (71%) based on comparisons with previously published catalogs, thereby increasing the number of detections in the field of view under consideration by a factor of ≈2.5. We find that the improved photometric precision per exposure due to longer exposure time for LCO images combined with the greater time sampling of LCO photometry enables us to increase the total number of detections in this field of view. Each LCO image covers a field of view of 26' × 26' and observes a region close to the Galactic plane (b = -9°4) abundant in stars with an average stellar density of ≈8 arcmin<SUP>-2</SUP>. We perform aperture photometry and Fourier analysis on over 2000 stars across 1560 LCO images spanning 537 days to find 28 candidate BY Draconis variables, three candidate eclipsing binaries of type EA, and seven candidate eclipsing binaries of type EW. In assigning preliminary classifications to our detections, we demonstrate the applicability of the Gaia color-magnitude diagram as a powerful classification tool for variable-star studies.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..133S
V-band photometry of asteroids from ASAS-SN. Finding asteroids with slow spin;;We present V-band photometry of the 20 000 brightest asteroids using data from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) between 2012 and 2018. We were able to apply the convex inversion method to more than 5000 asteroids with more than 60 good measurements in order to derive their sidereal rotation periods, spin axis orientations, and shape models. We derive unique spin state and shape solutions for 760 asteroids, including 163 new determinations. This corresponds to a success rate of about 15%, which is significantly higher than the success rate previously achieved using photometry from surveys. We derive the first sidereal rotation periods for additional 69 asteroids. We find good agreement in spin periods and pole orientations for objects with prior solutions. We obtain a statistical sample of asteroid physical properties that is sufficient for the detection of several previously known trends, such as the underrepresentation of slow rotators in current databases, and the anisotropic distribution of spin orientations driven by the nongravitational forces. We also investigate the dependence of spin orientations on the rotation period. Since 2018, ASAS-SN has been observing the sky with higher cadence and a deeper limiting magnitude, which will lead to many more new solutions in just a few years.

Exploring the nature of ambiguous merging systems: GW190425 in low latency;;GW190425 is a recently discovered gravitational wave (GW) source whose individual binary components are consistent with being neutron stars (NSs). However, the source-frame chirp mass 1.44 ± 0.02 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> is larger than that of any double NS system known as yet, and it falls in the `ambiguous' interval for which the presence of a black hole (BH) cannot be ruled out from the GW signal analysis alone. GW190425 might host an NS and a light BH, with a mass in the so-called lower mass gap. No electromagnetic (EM) counterpart has been associated with this event, due to the poorly informative sky localisation and larger distance compared to GW170817. We construct kilonova (KN) light curve models for GW190425, in both the double NS and BH-NS scenarios, considering two equations of state (EoSs) consistent with current constraints from GW170817 and the NICER results, including BH spin effects, and testing different fitting formulae for the ejecta mass. According to our models, the putative presence of a light BH in GW190425 would have produced a brighter KN emission compared to the double NS case, ideally leading to the possibility of distinguishing the nature of the binary. However, depending on the adopted fitting formula for the ejecta, the feasibility of this distinction might depend on the EoS and on the BH spin. Concerning candidate counterparts of GW190425, classified later on as supernovae, our models could have been used to discard two transients detected in their early r-band evolution, as these fall outside the phase space encompassed by our models. We conclude that combining the chirp mass and distance information from the GW signal with a library of KN light curves can help in identifying the EM counterpart early on, and we stress that the low-latency release of the chirp mass in this interval of ambiguous values can be vital for successful EM follow-ups.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...654A..12B
A transient radio source consistent with a merger-triggered core collapse supernova;;A core collapse supernova occurs when exothermic fusion ceases in the core of a massive star, which is typically caused by exhaustion of nuclear fuel. Theory predicts that fusion could be interrupted earlier by merging of the star with a compact binary companion. We report a luminous radio transient, VT J121001+495647, found in the Very Large Array Sky Survey. The radio emission is consistent with supernova ejecta colliding with a dense shell of material, potentially ejected by binary interaction in the centuries before explosion. We associate the supernova with an archival x-ray transient, which implies that a relativistic jet was launched during the explosion. The combination of an early relativistic jet and late-time dense interaction is consistent with expectations for a merger-driven explosion.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021Sci...373.1125D
The origins of massive black holes;;Massive black holes (MBHs) inhabit galactic centres, and power luminous quasars and active galactic nuclei, shaping their cosmic environment with the energy they produce. The origins of MBHs remain a mystery, and the recent detection by LIGO/Virgo of a black hole of almost 150 solar masses has revitalized the questions of whether there is a continuum between `stellar' and `massive' black holes, and what the seeds of MBHs are. Seeds could have formed in the first galaxies or could be related to the collapse of horizon-sized regions in the early Universe. Understanding the origins of MBHs straddles fundamental physics, cosmology and astrophysics, and bridges the fields of gravitational-wave physics and traditional astronomy. With several existing and upcoming facilities in the next 10-15 years, we foresee the possibility of discovering the avenues of formation of MBHs. This Review links three main topics: the channels of black hole seed formation, the journey from seeds to MBHs, and the diagnostics on the origins of MBHs. We highlight and critically discuss current unsolved problems, touching on recent developments.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatRP...3..732V
Spectroscopic and photometric analysis of symbiotic candidates - I. Ten candidates on classical symbiotic stars;;Symbiotic stars belong to a group of interacting binaries that display a wide variety of phenomena, including prominent outbursts connected with mass transfer, as well as stellar winds, jets, eclipses, or intrinsic variability of the components. Dozens of new symbiotic stars and candidates have been discovered in recent years. However, there are many objects that are still poorly studied. Some symbiotic candidates suspected in the literature have never been studied spectroscopically. In this contribution, we present the first results of the ongoing campaign focused on symbiotic candidates. In the first paper in the series, we study the nature of 10 candidate classical symbiotic stars suspected based on their photometric behaviour, colours or abundance pattern. To confirm or reject the symbiotic nature of the studied candidates, we obtained new spectra and analysed them in detail together with available multifrequency photometric and spectroscopic observations of the objects. Hen 3-860 and V2204 Oph are genuine symbiotic systems showing typical spectral features of burning symbiotic stars and outbursts in the last 100 yr. The first object belongs to the uncommon group of eclipsing symbiotic stars. V1988 Sgr cannot be classified as a genuine burning symbiotic star, but the scenario of an accreting-only symbiotic system cannot be ruled out. Hen 4-204 might be a bonafide symbiotic star due to its similarity with the known symbiotic binary BD Cam. Six other symbiotic candidates (V562 Lyr, IRAS 19050+0001, EC 19249-7343, V1017 Cyg, PN K1-6, V379 Peg) are either single dwarf or giant stars or non-symbiotic binaries.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.4151M
White dwarf planetary debris dependence on physical structure distributions within asteroid belts;;White dwarfs that exhibit transit signatures of planetary debris and accreted planetary material provide exceptional opportunities to probe the material composition and dynamical structure of planetary systems. Although previous theoretical work investigating the role of minor body disruption around white dwarfs has focused on spherical bodies, Solar system asteroids can be more accurately modelled as triaxial ellipsoids. Here, we present an analytical framework to identify the type of disruption (tidal fragmentation, total sublimation, or direct impact) experienced by triaxial asteroids approaching white dwarfs on extremely eccentric (e ~ 1) orbits. This framework is then used to identify the outcomes for simplified Main belt analogues of 100 bodies across five different white dwarf temperatures. We also present an empirical relationship between cooling age and effective temperature for both DA and DB white dwarfs to identify the age of the white dwarfs considered here. We find that using a purely spherical shape model can underestimate the physical size and radial distance at which an asteroid is subjected to complete sublimation, and these differences increase with greater elongation of the body. Contrastingly, fragmentation always occurs in the largest semi-axis of a body and so can be modelled by a sphere of that radius. Both fragmentation and sublimation are greatly affected by the body's material composition, and hence by the composition of their progenitor asteroid belts. The white dwarf temperature, and hence cooling age, can affect the expected debris distribution: higher temperatures sublimate large elongated asteroids, and cooler temperatures accommodate more direct impacts.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.4031M
Discovery of superslow rotating asteroids with ATLAS and ZTF photometry;;We present here the discovery of a new class of superslow rotating asteroids (P<SUB>rot</SUB> ≳1000 h) in data extracted from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) all-sky surveys. Of the 39 rotation periods we report here, 32 have periods longer than any previously reported unambiguous rotation periods currently in the Asteroid Light Curve Data base. In our sample, seven objects have a rotation period >4000 h and the longest period we report here is 4812 h (~200 d). We do not observe any correlation between taxonomy, albedo, or orbital properties with superslow rotating status. The most plausible mechanism for the creation of these very slow rotators is if their rotations were slowed by YORP spin-down. Superslow rotating asteroids may be common, with at least 0.4 per cent of the main-belt asteroid population with a size range between 2 and 20 km in diameter rotating with periods longer than 1000 h.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.3872E
A microlensing search of 700 million VVV light curves;;The VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey and its extension have been monitoring about 560 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of sky centred on the Galactic bulge and inner disc for nearly a decade. The photometric catalogue contains of order 10$^9$ sources monitored in the $K_s$ band down to 18 mag over hundreds of epochs from 2010 to 2019. Using these data we develop a decision tree classifier to identify microlensing events. As inputs to the tree, we extract a few physically motivated features as well as simple statistics ensuring a good fit to a microlensing model both on and off the event amplification. This produces a fast and efficient classifier trained on a set of simulated microlensing events and catacylsmic variables, together with flat baseline light curves randomly chosen from the VVV data. The classifier achieves 97 per cent accuracy in identifying simulated microlensing events in a validation set. We run the classifier over the VVV data set and then visually inspect the results, which produces a catalogue of 1959 microlensing events. For these events, we provide the Einstein radius crossing time via a Bayesian analysis. The spatial dependence on recovery efficiency of our classifier is well characterized, and this allows us to compute spatially resolved completeness maps as a function of Einstein crossing time over the VVV footprint. We compare our approach to previous microlensing searches of the VVV. We highlight the importance of Bayesian fitting to determine the microlensing parameters for events with surveys like VVV with sparse data.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.2482H
Binary neutron star merger in common envelope jets supernovae;;I explore a triple-star scenario where a tight neutron star (NS)-NS binary system enters the envelope of a red supergiant (RSG) star and spirals-in towards its core. The two NSs accrete mass through accretion discs and launch jets that power a very luminous and long transient event, a common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) event. Dynamical friction brings the two NSs to merge either in the RSG envelope or core. The total energy of the event, radiation and kinetic, is $rsim 10^{52} {~\rm erg}$. The light curve stays luminous for months to years and a signal of gravitational waves might be detected. The ejecta contain freshly synthesized r-process elements not only from the NS-NS merger as in kilonova events, but possibly also from the pre-merger jets that the NSs launch inside the core, as in the r-process CEJSN scenario. This scenario shortens the time to NS-NS merger compared with that of kilonovae, and might somewhat ease the problem of the NS-NS r-process scenario to account for r-process nucleosynthesis in the early Universe. I estimate the ratio of NS-NS merger in CEJSN events to core collapse supernova (CCSN) events to be ≲10<SUP>-6</SUP> - 2 × 10<SUP>-5</SUP>. However, because they are much more luminous I expect their detection fraction to that of CCSNe to be much larger than this number. This study calls for considering this and similar CEJSN scenarios in binary and in triple-star systems when explaining peculiar and puzzling superluminous supernovae.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.2445S
The Heraklion Extragalactic Catalogue (HECATE): a value-added galaxy catalogue for multimessenger astrophysics;;We present the Heraklion Extragalactic Catalogue, or HECATE, an all-sky value-added galaxy catalogue, aiming to facilitate present and future multiwavelength and multimessenger studies in the local Universe. It contains 204 733 galaxies up to a redshift of 0.047 (D${\lesssim }200\, \text{Mpc}{}$), and it is >50 per cent complete in terms of the B-band luminosity density at distances in the 0-170 Mpc range. By incorporating and homogenizing data from astronomical data bases and multiwavelength surveys, the catalogue offers positions, sizes, distances, morphological classifications, star formation rates, stellar masses, metallicities, and nuclear activity classifications. This wealth of information can enable a wide range of applications, such as (i) demographic studies of extragalactic sources, (ii) initial characterization of transient events, and (iii) searches for electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational-wave events. The catalogue is publicly available to the community at a dedicated portal, which will also host future extensions in terms of the covered volume and data products.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.1896K
SN 2020cpg: an energetic link between Type IIb and Ib supernovae;;Stripped-envelope supernovae (SE-SNe) show a wide variety of photometric and spectroscopic properties. This is due to the different potential formation channels and the stripping mechanism that allows for a large diversity within the progenitors outer envelope compositions. Here, the photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2020cpg covering ~130 d from the explosion date are presented. SN 2020cpg (z = 0.037) is a bright SE-SNe with the B-band peaking at M<SUB>B</SUB> = -17.75 ± 0.39 mag and a maximum pseudo-bolometric luminosity of L<SUB>max</SUB> = 6.03 ± 0.01 × 10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Spectroscopically, SN 2020cpg displays a weak high- and low-velocity H α feature during the photospheric phase of its evolution, suggesting that it contained a detached hydrogen envelope prior to explosion. From comparisons with spectral models, the mass of hydrogen within the outer envelope was constrained to be ~0.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. From the pseudo-bolometric light curve of SN 2020cpg a <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass of M<SUB>Ni</SUB> ~ 0.27 ± 0.08 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> was determined using an Arnett-like model. The ejecta mass and kinetic energy of SN 2020cpg were determined using an alternative method that compares the light curve of SN 2020cpg and several modelled SE-SNe, resulting in an ejecta mass of M<SUB>ejc</SUB> ~ 5.5 ± 2.0 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a kinetic energy of E<SUB>K</SUB> ~ 9.0 ± 3.0 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg. The ejected mass indicates a progenitor mass of 18-25 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The use of the comparative light curve method provides an alternative process to the commonly used Arnett-like model to determine the physical properties of SE-SNe.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.1832M
Rare events of a peculiar thermonuclear supernova that precedes a core-collapse supernova;;We study stellar binary evolution that leads to the formation of a white dwarf (WD) that explodes in a thermonuclear supernova at the termination of a common envelope evolution (CEE) shortly before the core of its companion explodes as a core-collapse supernova (CCSN). The CCSN explosion of the core, which is the remnant of a red supergiant (RSG) star, might take place few months to several years after the explosion of the WD as a thermonuclear supernova, i.e. a Type Ia peculiar supernova (peculiar SN Ia). Using the evolutionary code MESA-BINARY, we simulate the evolution of binary systems with stars of initial masses of $6\!-\!7.5\, {\rm M}_\odot$. The more massive star, the primary, transfers mass to the secondary star and leaves a CO WD remnant. The secondary becomes massive enough to end in a CCSN. As the secondary evolves to the RSG phase, it engulfs the WD and the system experiences a CEE that ends with a WD-core binary system at an orbital separation of a<SUB>f</SUB> ≃ 1-5 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Our simulations show that the core explodes as a CCSN at $t_{\rm CEE-CCSN} \simeq 3000 \!-\! 10^5 {~\rm yr}$ after the CEE. We assume that if the WD accretes helium-rich gas from the core it might explode as an SN Ia in the frame of the double detonation scenario for SNe Ia and peculiar SNe Ia. We predict the very rare occurrence of a peculiar SN Ia followed within months to years by a CCSN.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506..919B
The population of near-earth asteroids revisited and updated;;In this paper we update, extend, and improve upon the recent paper on Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) population by Harris and D'Abramo (2015). We update the population estimate taking into account discoveries to August 3, 2020. Shortly after the previous paper was published, we identified a problem in our previous studies due to rounding off of absolute magnitude H by the Minor Planet Center to 0.1 magnitude that implicitly shifted our bin boundaries by 0.05 magnitude. Here we correct the problem by choosing H bin boundaries at 0.25-0.75 magnitude, rather than 0.00-0.50 magnitude thereby eliminating the round-off shift. We also introduce an updated model distribution of NEA orbits (Granvik et al. 2018) in our survey simulations. This new population model includes orbital distributions as a function of size, allowing us to test our presumption that distributions are homologous with respect to size. The change in distribution of orbits between that used by Harris and D'Abramo (2015) and the newer Granvik et al. (2018) distributions was substantially greater than the range over size given in the latter, but made almost no difference in population estimates, suggesting that the re-detection algorithm is robust and does not depend strongly on the detailed orbit distribution, and also validates our presumption of homologous distribution over size. For the current analysis, we have added ATLAS and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to our analysis. We have separately analyzed the re-detection ratio versus size (H magnitude) for each of four surveys (Catalina + Mt. Lemmon, Pan-STARRS, ATLAS and ZTF) to investigate any differences between the various systems and cadences, and found none of significance, thus again, the re-detection algorithm appears very robust and mostly independent of survey parameters. With these changes and more recent discovery statistics to 2020, we estimate the number of NEAs of absolute magnitude H < 17.75 (nominally D > 1 km) to be 940 ± 10. Following the updated population estimate, we examine more closely the rates of discovery of the largest NEAs (absolute magnitude H < 17.75, nominally diameter D > 1 km) to make a more detailed estimate of the numbers of these large objects that remain undiscovered. Lastly we use the distribution of albedos of NEAs from NEOWISE observations (Mainzer et al. 2011) to transform our population estimate from number versus H, N(<H), to number versus D, N(>D). Unfortunately this transformation depends substantially on only minor uncertainties in the albedo distribution, so N(>D) remains much less certain than N(<H).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021Icar..36514452H
Yukawa-Casimir wormholes;;In this work, we consider a Yukawa modification of the Casimir wormhole. With the help of an Equation of State, we impose Zero Tidal Forces. We will examine two different approaches: in a first approach, we will fix the form of the shape function of the Casimir wormholes modified by a Yukawa term in three different ways and finally a superposition of different profiles. In the second approach, we will consider the original Casimir source modified by a Yukawa term in three different ways and we will deduce the form of the shape function In both the approaches the reference energy density will be that of the Casimir source. Connection with the Absurdly Benign Traversable Wormhole are also discussed.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021EPJC...81..824G
The Discovery of Two LISA Sources within 0.5 kpc;;We report the discovery of the brightest detached binary white dwarfs with periods less than an hour, which provide two new gravitational-wave verification binaries for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The first one, SMSS J033816.16-813929.9 (hereafter J0338), is a 30.6 minute orbital period, g = 17.2 mag detached double white dwarf binary with a Gaia parallax measurement that places it at a distance of 533 pc. The observed radial velocity and photometric variability provide precise constraints on the system parameters. J0338 contains a 0.230 ± 0.015 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> white dwarf with a ${0.38}_{-0.03}^{+0.05}\,{M}_{\odot }$ companion at an inclination of 69° ± 9°. The second system, SDSS J063449.92+380352.2 (hereafter J0634), is a 26.5 minute orbital period, g = 17.0 mag detached double white dwarf binary at a distance of 435 pc. J0634 contains a ${0.452}_{-0.062}^{+0.070}\,{M}_{\odot }$ white dwarf with a ${0.209}_{-0.021}^{+0.034}\,{M}_{\odot }$ companion at an inclination of 37° ± 7°. The more massive white dwarf in J0634 is hotter than its companion, even though tidal dissipation is predicted to be relatively inefficient at such periods. This suggests that the more massive white dwarf formed last. J0338 and J0634 will be detected by LISA with a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 and 19, respectively, after four years. We identified these two systems based on their overluminosity and u-band photometry. Follow-up of u-band selected Gaia targets will likely yield additional LISA verification binaries.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...918L..14K
Fast-transient Searches in Real Time with ZTFReST: Identification of Three Optically Discovered Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows and New Constraints on the Kilonova Rate;;The most common way to discover extragalactic fast transients, which fade within a few nights in the optical, is via follow-up of gamma-ray burst and gravitational-wave triggers. However, wide-field surveys have the potential to identify rapidly fading transients independently of such external triggers. The volumetric survey speed of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) makes it sensitive to objects as faint and fast fading as kilonovae, the optical counterparts to binary neutron star mergers, out to almost 200 Mpc. We introduce an open-source software infrastructure, the ZTF REaltime Search and Triggering, ZTFReST, designed to identify kilonovae and fast transients in ZTF data. Using the ZTF alert stream combined with forced point-spread-function photometry, we have implemented automated candidate ranking based on their photometric evolution and fitting to kilonova models. Automated triggering, with a human in the loop for monitoring, of follow-up systems has also been implemented. In 13 months of science validation, we found several extragalactic fast transients independently of any external trigger, including two supernovae with post-shock cooling emission, two known afterglows with an associated gamma-ray burst (ZTF20abbiixp, ZTF20abwysqy), two known afterglows without any known gamma-ray counterpart (ZTF20aajnksq, ZTF21aaeyldq), and three new fast-declining sources (ZTF20abtxwfx, ZTF20acozryr, ZTF21aagwbjr) that are likely associated with GRB200817A, GRB201103B, and GRB210204A. However, we have not found any objects that appear to be kilonovae. We constrain the rate of GW170817-like kilonovae to R < 900 Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> (95% confidence). A framework such as ZTFReST could become a prime tool for kilonova and fast-transient discovery with the Vera Rubin Observatory.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...918...63A
Mass, Spin, and Ultralight Boson Constraints from the Intermediate-mass Black Hole in the Tidal Disruption Event 3XMM J215022.4-055108;;We simultaneously and successfully fit the multiepoch X-ray spectra of the tidal disruption event (TDE) 3XMM J215022.4-055108 using a modified version of our relativistic slim disk model that now accounts for angular momentum losses from radiation. We explore the effects of different disk properties and of uncertainties in the spectral hardening factor f<SUB>c</SUB> and redshift z on the estimation of the black hole mass M<SUB>•</SUB> and spin a<SUB>•</SUB>. Across all choices of theoretical priors, we constrain M<SUB>•</SUB> to less than 2.2 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> at 1σ confidence. Assuming that the TDE host is a star cluster associated with the adjacent, brighter, barred lenticular galaxy at z = 0.055, we constrain M<SUB>•</SUB> and a<SUB>•</SUB> to be ${1.75}_{-0.05}^{+0.45}\times {10}^{4}$ M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and ${0.8}_{-0.02}^{+0.12}$ , respectively, at 1σ confidence. The high, but sub-extremal, spin suggests that, if this intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) has grown significantly since formation, it has acquired its last e-fold in mass in a way incompatible with both the "standard" and "chaotic" limits of gas accretion. Ours is the first clear IMBH with a spin measurement. As such, this object represents a novel laboratory for astroparticle physics; its M<SUB>•</SUB> and a<SUB>•</SUB> place tight limits on the existence of ultralight bosons, ruling out those with masses from ~10<SUP>-15</SUP> to 10<SUP>-16</SUP> eV.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...918...46W
Blueshifted Hydrogen Emission and Shock Wave of RR Lyrae Variables in SDSS and LAMOST;;Hydrogen emissions of RR Lyrae variables are the imprints of shock waves traveling through their atmospheres. We develop a pattern recognition algorithm, which is then applied to single-epoch spectra of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope survey. These two spectroscopic surveys covered ~10,000 photometrically confirmed RR Lyrae stars. We discovered in total 127 RR Lyrae stars with blueshifted Balmer emission features, including 103 fundamental mode (RRab), 20 first-overtone (RRc), 3 double-mode (RRd), and 1 Blazhko-type (temporary classification for RR Lyrae stars with strong Blazhko modulation in the Catalina sky survey that cannot be characterized) RR Lyrae variable. This forms the largest database to date of the properties of hydrogen emission in RR Lyrae variables. Based on Zwicky Transient Facility DR5, we carried out a detailed light-curve analysis for the Blazhko-type RR Lyrae star with hydrogen emission of long-term modulations. We characterize the Blazhko-type RR Lyrae star as an RRab and point out a possible Blazhko period. Finally, we set up simulations on mock spectra to test the performance of our algorithm and on the real observational strategy to investigate the occurrence of the "first apparition.";;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...918....3D
Tidal Disruption Events;;The concept of stars being tidally ripped apart and consumed by a massive black hole (MBH) lurking in the center of a galaxy first captivated theorists in the late 1970s. The observational evidence for these rare but illuminating phenomena for probing otherwise dormant MBHs first emerged in archival searches of the soft X-ray ROSAT All-Sky Survey in the 1990s, but has recently accelerated with the increasing survey power in the optical time domain, with tidal disruption events (TDEs) now regarded as a class of optical nuclear transients with distinct spectroscopic features. Multiwavelength observations of TDEs have revealed panchromatic emission, probing a wide range of scales, from the innermost regions of the accretion flow to the surrounding circumnuclear medium. I review the current census of 56 TDEs reported in the literature, and their observed properties can be summarized as follows: The optical light curves follow a power-law decline from peak that scales with the inferred central black hole mass as expected for the fallback rate of the stellar debris, but the rise time does not. The UV-optical and soft X-ray thermal emission come from different spatial scales, and their intensity ratio has a large dynamic range and is highly variable, providing important clues as to what is powering the two components. They can be grouped into three spectral classes, and those with Bowen fluorescence line emission show a preference for a hotter and more compact line-emitting region, whereas those with only HeII emission lines are the rarest class.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ARA&A..59...21G
A Systematic Search for Outbursting AM CVn Systems with the Zwicky Transient Facility;;AM CVn systems are a rare type of accreting binary that consists of a white dwarf and a helium-rich, degenerate donor star. Using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), we searched for new AM CVn systems by focusing on blue, outbursting stars. We first selected outbursting stars using the ZTF alerts. We cross matched the candidates with Gaia and Pan-STARRS catalogs. The initial selection of candidates based on the Gaia BP-RP contains 1751 unknown objects. We used the Pan-STARRS g-r and r-i color in combination with the Gaia color to identify 59 strong AM CVn candidates. We obtained identification spectra of 35 sources, of which 18 are high-priority candidates, and discovered nine new AM CVn systems and one magnetic CV that shows only He-II lines. Using the outburst recurrence time, we estimate the orbital periods of the nine new AM CVn systems that are in the range of 29-50 minutes. We conclude that targeted follow up of blue, outbursting sources is an efficient method to find new AM CVn systems and we plan to follow up all candidates we identified to systematically study the population of outbursting AM CVn systems.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..113V
Combining Astrometry and Elemental Abundances: The Case of the Candidate Pre-Gaia Halo Moving Groups G03-37, G18-39, and G21-22;;While most moving groups are young and nearby, a small number have been identified in the Galactic halo. Understanding the origin and evolution of these groups is an important piece of reconstructing the formation history of the halo. Here we report on our analysis of three putative halo moving groups: G03-37, G18-39, and G21-22. Based on Gaia EDR3 data, the stars associated with each group show some scatter in velocity (e.g., Toomre diagram) and integrals of motion (energy, angular momentum) spaces, counter to expectations of moving-group stars. We choose the best candidate of the three groups, G21-22, for follow-up chemical analysis based on high-resolution spectroscopy of six presumptive members. Using a new Python code that uses a Bayesian method to self-consistently propagate uncertainties from stellar atmosphere solutions in calculating individual abundances and spectral synthesis, we derive the abundances of α- (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), Fe-peak (Cr, Sc, Mn, Fe, Ni), odd-Z (Na, Al, V), and neutron-capture (Ba, Eu) elements for each star. We find that the G21-22 stars are not chemically homogeneous. Based on the kinematic analysis for all three groups and the chemical analysis for G21-22, we conclude the three are not genuine moving groups. The case for G21-22 demonstrates the benefit of combining kinematic and chemical information in identifying conatal populations when either alone may be insufficient. Comparing the integrals of motion and velocities of the six G21-22 stars with those of known structures in the halo, we tentatively associate them with the Gaia-Enceladus accretion event. <SUP>*</SUP> Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory under ESO program 090.B-0605(A).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..109S
Cataclysmic Variables in the Second Year of the Zwicky Transient Facility;;Using a filter in the GROWTH Marshal based on color and the amplitude and timescale of variability, we have identified 372 objects as known or candidate cataclysmic variables (CVs) during the second year of the operation of the Zwicky Transient Facility. From the available difference imaging data, we found that 93 are previously confirmed CVs and 279 are strong candidates. Spectra of four of the candidates confirm them as CVs by the presence of Balmer emission lines, while one of the four has prominent He II lines indicative of containing a magnetic white dwarf. Gaia EDR3 parallaxes are available for 154 of these systems, resulting in distances from 108-2096 pc and absolute magnitudes in the range of 7.5-15.0, with the largest number of candidates between 10.5 and 12.5. The total numbers are 21% higher than from the previous year of the survey with a greater number of distances available but a smaller percentage of systems close to the Galactic plane. Comparison of these findings with a machine-learning method of searching all the light curves reveals large differences in each data set related to the parameters involved in the search process.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162...94S
Deep transfer learning for the classification of variable sources;;Ongoing or upcoming surveys such as Gaia, ZTF, or LSST will observe the light curves of billions or more astronomical sources. This presents new challenges for identifying interesting and important types of variability. Collecting a sufficient amount of labeled data for training is difficult, especially in the early stages of a new survey. Here we develop a single-band light-curve classifier based on deep neural networks and use transfer learning to address the training data paucity problem by conveying knowledge from one data set to another. First we train a neural network on 16 variability features extracted from the light curves of OGLE and EROS-2 variables. We then optimize this model using a small set (e.g., 5%) of periodic variable light curves from the ASAS data set in order to transfer knowledge inferred from OGLE and EROS-2 to a new ASAS classifier. With this we achieve good classification results on ASAS, thereby showing that knowledge can be successfully transferred between data sets. We demonstrate similar transfer learning using HIPPARCOS and ASAS-SN data. We therefore find that it is not necessary to train a neural network from scratch for every new survey; rather, transfer learning can be used, even when only a small set of labeled data is available in the new survey.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...653A..22K
A characteristic optical variability time scale in astrophysical accretion disks;;Accretion disks around supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei produce continuum radiation at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths. Physical processes in the accretion flow lead to stochastic variability of this emission on a wide range of time scales. We measured the optical continuum variability observed in 67 active galactic nuclei and the characteristic time scale at which the variability power spectrum flattens. We found a correlation between this time scale and the black hole mass extending over the entire mass range of supermassive black holes. This time scale is consistent with the expected thermal time scale at the ultraviolet-emitting radius in standard accretion disk theory. Accreting white dwarfs lie close to this correlation, suggesting a common process for all accretion disks.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021Sci...373..789B
Bounds on GUP parameters from GW150914 and GW190521;;We compute bounds on the GUP parameters for two versions of GUP using gravitational wave data from the events GW150914 and GW190521. The speed of the graviton and photon are calculated in a curved spacetime modified by GUP, assuming that these particles have a small mass. The observational bound on the difference in their speeds translates to bounds on the GUP parameters. These bounds are some of the best obtained so far in the context of quantum gravity phenomenology.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PhLB..81936429D
Six Outbursts of Comet 46P/Wirtanen;;Cometary activity is a manifestation of sublimation-driven processes at the surface of nuclei. However, cometary outbursts may arise from other processes that are not necessarily driven by volatiles. In order to fully understand nuclear surfaces and their evolution, we must identify the causes of cometary outbursts. In that context, we present a study of mini-outbursts of comet 46P/Wirtanen. Six events are found in our long-term lightcurve of the comet around its perihelion passage in 2018. The apparent strengths range from -0.2 to -1.6 mag in a 5″ radius aperture and correspond to dust masses between ~10<SUP>4</SUP> and 10<SUP>6</SUP> kg, but with large uncertainties due to the unknown grain size distributions. However, the nominal mass estimates are on the same order of magnitude as the mini-outbursts at comet 9P/Tempel 1 and 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, events that were notably lacking at comet 103P/Hartley 2. We compare the frequency of outbursts at the four comets, and suggest that the surface of 46P has large-scale (~10-100 m) roughness that is intermediate to that of 67P and 103P, if not similar to the latter. The strength of the outbursts appear to be correlated with time since the last event, but a physical interpretation with respect to solar insolation is lacking. We also examine Hubble Space Telescope images taken about two days following a near-perihelion outburst. No evidence for macroscopic ejecta was found in the image, with a limiting radius of about 2 m.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PSJ.....2..131K
Error Analysis of the Light Curve Solution of Contact Binaries Based on the W-D Code;;We use the idea of repeat measurement to determine the mean value and error of light curve solution parameters of contact binaries. Our simulation is realized by the Monte Carlo algorithm and Wilson-Devinney code. This method can obtain systematic and random errors simultaneously. Within our 48 models, the systematic errors are smaller than the random errors in most cases. According to the numerical calculations, it is found that the relative errors of photometric mass ratios are less than 1% for totally eclipsing contact binaries, while they are generally between 10% and 20% for partly eclipsing ones. The effect of third light on the errors of the photometric solution is also investigated. With a third light, these errors are close to 10% for totally eclipsing contact binaries. Especially, it is better to set the third light to zero in flux if that light is very faint (e.g., less than 1% contribution in luminosity), because such faint third light will bring big errors to the light curve solutions.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASP..133h4202L
The GALAH survey and symbiotic stars - I. Discovery and follow-up of 33 candidate accreting-only systems;;We have identified a first group of 33 new candidates for symbiotic stars (SySt) of the accreting-only variety among the 600 255 stars so far observed by the GALactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) high-resolution spectroscopic survey of the Southern hemisphere, more than doubling the number of those previously known. GALAH aims to high latitudes and this offers the possibility to sound the Galaxy for new SySt away from the usual plane and bulge hunting regions. In this paper, we focus on SySt of the M spectral type, showing an Hα emission with a peak in excess of 0.5 above the adjacent continuum level, and not affected by coherent radial pulsations. These constraints will be relaxed in future studies. The 33 new candidate SySt were subjected to an array of follow-up confirmatory observations [X-ray/ultraviolet (UV) observations with the Swift satellite, search for optical flickering, presence of a near-UV upturn in ground-based photometric and spectroscopic data, radial velocity changes suggestive of orbital motion, and variability of the emission-line profiles]. According to Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) parallaxes, the candidate new SySt are located at the tip of the giant branch, sharing the same distribution in M(K<SUB>s</SUB>) of the well-established SySt. The accretion luminosities of the candidate new SySt are in the range 1-10 L<SUB>⊙</SUB>, corresponding to mass accretion rates of 0.1-1 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for white dwarfs of 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>.

SN 2015bf: A fast declining type II supernova with flash-ionized signatures;;We present optical and ultraviolet photometry, as well as optical spectra, for the type II supernova (SN) 2015bf. Our observations cover the phases from ~2 to ~200 d after explosion. The first spectrum is characterized by a blue continuum with a blackbody temperature of ~24 000 K and flash-ionized emission lines. After about 1 week, the spectra of SN 2015bf evolve like those of a regular SN II. From the luminosity of the narrow emission component of H α, we deduce that the mass-loss rate is larger than ${\sim}3.7\times 10^{-3}\, {\rm M_\odot \, yr^{-1}}$. The disappearance of the flash features in the first week after explosion indicates that the circumstellar material is confined within ~6 × 10<SUP>14</SUP> cm. Thus, we suggest that the progenitor of SN 2015bf experienced violent mass loss shortly before the supernova explosion. The multiband light curves show that SN 2015bf has a high peak luminosity with an absolute visual magnitude M<SUB>V</SUB> = -18.11 ± 0.08 mag and a fast post-peak decline with a V-band decay of 1.22 ± 0.09 mag within ~50 d after maximum light. Moreover, the R-band tail luminosity of SN 2015bf is fainter than that of SNe II with similar peak by 1-2 mag, suggesting a small amount of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni (${\sim}0.009\, {\rm M_\odot }$) synthesized during the explosion. Such a low nickel mass indicates that the progenitor of SN 2015bf could be a super-asymptotic-giant-branch star that collapsed owing to electron capture.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.4890L
Light-curve classification with recurrent neural networks for GOTO: dealing with imbalanced data;;The advent of wide-field sky surveys has led to the growth of transient and variable source discoveries. The data deluge produced by these surveys has necessitated the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms to sift through the vast incoming data stream. A problem that arises in real-world applications of learning algorithms for classification is imbalanced data, where a class of objects within the data is underrepresented, leading to a bias for overrepresented classes in the ML and DL classifiers. We present a recurrent neural network (RNN) classifier that takes in photometric time-series data and additional contextual information (such as distance to nearby galaxies and on-sky position) to produce real-time classification of objects observed by the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer, and use an algorithm-level approach for handling imbalance with a focal loss function. The classifier is able to achieve an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.972 when using all available photometric observations to classify variable stars, supernovae, and active galactic nuclei. The RNN architecture allows us to classify incomplete light curves, and measure how performance improves as more observations are included. We also investigate the role that contextual information plays in producing reliable object classification.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.4345B
Predicting electromagnetic counterparts using low-latency gravitational-wave data products;;Searches for gravitational-wave counterparts have been going in earnest since GW170817 and the discovery of AT2017gfo. Since then, the lack of detection of other optical counterparts connected to binary neutron star or black hole-neutron star candidates has highlighted the need for a better discrimination criterion to support this effort. At the moment, low-latency gravitational-wave alerts contain preliminary information about binary properties and hence whether a detected binary might have an electromagnetic counterpart. The current alert method is a classifier that estimates the probability that there is a debris disc outside the black hole created during the merger as well as the probability of a signal being a binary neutron star, a black hole-neutron star, a binary black hole, or of terrestrial origin. In this work, we expand upon this approach to both predict the ejecta properties and provide contours of potential light curves for these events, in order to improve the follow-up observation strategy. The various sources of uncertainty are discussed, and we conclude that our ignorance about the ejecta composition and the insufficient constraint of the binary parameters by low-latency pipelines represent the main limitations. To validate the method, we test our approach on real events from the second and third Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)-Virgo observing runs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.4235S
The ZTF Source Classification Project - II. Periodicity and variability processing metrics;;The current generation of all-sky surveys is rapidly expanding our ability to study variable and transient sources. These surveys, with a variety of sensitivities, cadences, and fields of view, probe many ranges of time-scale and magnitude. Data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) yields an opportunity to find variables on time-scales from minutes to months. In this paper, we present the codebase, ztfperiodic, and the computational metrics employed for the catalogue based on ZTF's Second Data Release. We describe the publicly available, graphical-process-unit optimized period-finding algorithms employed, and highlight the benefit of existing and future graphical-process-unit clusters. We show how generating metrics as input to catalogues of this scale is possible for future ZTF data releases. Further work will be needed for future data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.2954C
A high-rate foreground of sub-second flares from geosynchronous satellites;;The Weizmann Fast Astronomical Survey Telescope is a 55 cm optical survey telescope with a high-cadence (25 Hz) monitoring of the sky over a wide field of view (≈7 deg<SUP>2</SUP>). The high frame rate allows detection of sub-second transients over multiple images. We present a sample of ~0.1-0.3 s duration flares detected in an untargeted survey for such transients. We show that most, if not all of them, are glints of sunlight reflected off geosynchronous and graveyard orbit satellites. The flares we detect have a typical magnitude of 9-11, which translates to ~14-16th magnitude if diluted by a 30 s exposure time. We estimate the rate of events brighter than ~11 mag to be of the order of 30-40 events per day per deg<SUP>2</SUP>, for declinations between -20° and +10°, not including the declination corresponding to the geostationary belt directly above the equator, where the rate can be higher. We show that such glints are common in large area surveys (e.g. Zwicky Transient Facility and Legacy Survey of Space and Time), and that some of them have a point-like appearance, confounding searches for fast transients such as fast radio burst counterparts and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). By observing in the direction of the Earth's shadow, we are able to put an upper limit on the rate of fast astrophysical transients of 0.052 deg<SUP>-2</SUP> day<SUP>-1</SUP> (95 per cent confidence limit) for events brighter than 11 mag. We also suggest that the single image, high declination flare observed in coincidence with the GN-z11 galaxy and assumed to be a GRB, is also consistent with such a satellite glint.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.2477N
Peculiar-velocity cosmology with Types Ia and II supernovae;;We present the Democratic Samples of Supernovae (DSS), a compilation of 775 low-redshift Type Ia and II supernovae (SNe Ia and II), of which 137 SN Ia distances are derived via the newly developed snapshot distance method. Using the objects in the DSS as tracers of the peculiar-velocity field, we compare against the corresponding reconstruction from the 2M++ galaxy redshift survey. Our analysis - which takes special care to properly weight each DSS subcatalogue and cross-calibrate the relative distance scales between them - results in a measurement of the cosmological parameter combination $f\sigma _8 = 0.390_{-0.022}^{+0.022}$ as well as an external bulk flow velocity of $195_{-23}^{+22}$ km s<SUP>-1</SUP> in the direction $(\ell , b) = (292_{-7}^{+7}, -6_{-4}^{+5})$ deg, which originates from beyond the 2M++ reconstruction. Similarly, we find a bulk flow of $245_{-31}^{+32}$ km s<SUP>-1</SUP> towards $(\ell , b) = (294_{-7}^{+7}, 3_{-5}^{+6})$ deg on a scale of $\sim 30\, h^{-1}$ Mpc if we ignore the reconstructed peculiar-velocity field altogether. Our constraint on fσ<SUB>8</SUB> - the tightest derived from SNe to date (considering only statistical error bars), and the only one to utilize SNe II - is broadly consistent with other results from the literature. We intend for our data accumulation and treatment techniques to become the prototype for future studies that will exploit the unprecedented data volume from upcoming wide-field surveys.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.2349S
LAMOST J0140355 + 392651: an evolved cataclysmic variable donor transitioning to become an extremely low-mass white dwarf;;We present LAMOST J0140355 + 392651 (hereafter J0140), a close (P<SUB>orb</SUB> = 3.81 h) binary containing a bloated, low-mass ($M \approx 0.15 \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) proto-white dwarf (WD) and a massive ($M \approx 0.95\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) WD companion. The system's optical light curve is dominated by large-amplitude ellipsoidal variability but also exhibits additional scatter, likely driven by pulsations. The proto-WD is cooler (T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 6800 ± 100 K) and more puffy ($\log \left[g/\left({\rm cm\, s^{-2}}\right)\right]=4.74\pm 0.07$) than any known extremely low-mass (ELM) WD, but hotter than any known cataclysmic variable (CV) donor. It either completely or very nearly fills its Roche lobe ($R/R_{{\rm Roche\, lobe}}=0.99\pm 0.01$), suggesting ongoing or recently terminated mass transfer. No dwarf nova-like outbursts have been observed. The spectrum is dominated by the proto-WD but shows tentative hints of H α emission, perhaps due to accretion on to the massive WD. The properties of the system are well-matched by MESA binary evolution models of CVs with donors that underwent significant nuclear evolution before the onset of mass transfer. In these models, the bloated proto-WD is either still losing mass via stable Roche lobe overflow or was doing so until very recently. In either case, it is evolving towards higher temperatures at near-constant luminosity to become an ELM WD. If the system is detached, mass transfer likely ended when the donor became too hot for magnetic braking to remain efficient. Evolutionary models predict that the binary will shrink to P<SUB>orb</SUB> ≲ 10 min within a few Gyr, when it will either merge or become an AM CVn binary. J0140 provides an observational link between the formation channels of CVs, ELM WDs, detached ultracompact WD binaries, and AM CVn systems.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.2051E
Peculiarities of the chemical abundance distribution in galaxies NGC 3963 and NGC 7292;;Spectroscopic observations of 32 H II regions in the spiral galaxy NGC 3963 and the barred irregular galaxy NGC 7292 were carried out with the 2.5-m telescope of the Caucasus Mountain Observatory of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute using the Transient Double-beam Spectrograph with a dispersion of ≈1 Å pixel<SUP>-1</SUP> and a spectral resolution of ≈3 Å. These observations were used to estimate the oxygen and nitrogen abundances and the electron temperatures in H II regions through modern strong-line methods. In general, the galaxies have oxygen and nitrogen abundances typical of stellar systems with similar luminosities, sizes, and morphology. However, we have found some peculiarities in chemical abundance distributions in both galaxies. The distorted outer segment of the southern arm of NGC 3963 shows an excess oxygen and nitrogen abundances. Chemical elements abundances in NGC 7292 are constant and do not depend on the galactocentric distance. These peculiarities can be explained in terms of external gas accretion in the case of NGC 3963 and major merging for NGC 7292.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.2009G
The iron yield of normal Type II supernovae;;We present <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass estimates for 110 normal Type II supernovae (SNe II), computed here from their luminosity in the radioactive tail. This sample consists of SNe from the literature, with at least three photometric measurements in a single optical band within 95-320 d since explosion. To convert apparent magnitudes to bolometric ones, we compute bolometric corrections (BCs) using 15 SNe in our sample having optical and near-IR photometry, along with three sets of SN II atmosphere models to account for the unobserved flux. We find that the I- and i-bands are best suited to estimate luminosities through the BC technique. The <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass distribution of our SN sample has a minimum and maximum of 0.005 and 0.177 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, respectively, and a selection-bias-corrected average of 0.037 ± 0.005 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Using the latter value together with iron isotope ratios of two sets of core-collapse (CC) nucleosynthesis models, we calculate a mean iron yield of 0.040 ± 0.005 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> for normal SNe II. Combining this result with recent mean <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass measurements for other CC SN subtypes, we estimate a mean iron yield <0.068 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> for CC SNe, where the contribution of normal SNe II is >36 per cent. We also find that the empirical relation between <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass and steepness parameter (S) is poorly suited to measure the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass of normal SNe II. Instead, we present a correlation between <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass, S, and absolute magnitude at 50 d since explosion. The latter allows to measure <SUP>56</SUP>Ni masses of normal SNe II with a precision around 30 per cent.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.1742R
Cosmology with LIGO/Virgo dark sirens: Hubble parameter and modified gravitational wave propagation;;We present a detailed study of the methodology for correlating `dark sirens' (compact binaries coalescences without electromagnetic counterpart) with galaxy catalogs. We propose several improvements on the current state of the art, and we apply them to the GWTC-2 catalog of LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave (GW) detections, and the GLADE galaxy catalog, performing a detailed study of several sources of systematic errors that, with the expected increase in statistics, will eventually become the dominant limitation. We provide a measurement of H<SUB>0</SUB> from dark sirens alone, finding as the best result H<SUB>0</SUB> = 67.3<SUP>+27.6</SUP><SUB>-17.9</SUB> km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> (68% c.l.) which is, currently, the most stringent constraint obtained using only dark sirens. Combining dark sirens with the counterpart for GW170817 we find H<SUB>0</SUB> = 72.2<SUP>+13.9</SUP><SUB>-7.5</SUB> km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>. We also study modified GW propagation, which is a smoking gun of dark energy and modifications of gravity at cosmological scales, and we show that current observations of dark sirens already start to provide interesting limits. From dark sirens alone, our best result for the parameter Ξ<SUB>0</SUB> that measures deviations from GR (with Ξ<SUB>0</SUB> = 1 in GR) is Ξ<SUB>0</SUB> = 2.1<SUP>+3.2</SUP><SUB>-1.2</SUB>. We finally discuss limits on modified GW propagation under the tentative identification of the flare ZTF19abanrhr as the electromagnetic counterpart of the binary black hole coalescence GW190521, in which case our most stringent result is Ξ<SUB>0</SUB> = 1.8<SUP>+0.9</SUP><SUB>-0.6</SUB>.

NEOExchange - an online portal for NEO and Solar System science;;Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) has deployed a homogeneous telescope network of ten 1-m telescopes to four locations in the northern and southern hemispheres, with a planned network size of twelve 1-m telescopes at 6 locations. This network is very versatile and is designed to respond rapidly to target of opportunity events and also to perform long term monitoring of slowly changing astronomical phenomena. The global coverage, available telescope apertures, and flexibility of the LCO network make it ideal for discovery, follow-up, and characterization of Solar System objects such as asteroids, Kuiper Belt Objects, comets, and especially Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). 

We describe the development of the "LCO NEO Follow-up Network" which makes use of the LCO network of robotic telescopes and an online, cloud-based web portal, NEOexchange, to perform photometric characterization and spectroscopic classification of NEOs and follow-up astrometry for both confirmed NEOs and unconfirmed NEO candidates. 

The follow-up astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic characterization efforts are focused on those NEO targets that are due to be observed by the planetary radar facilities and those on the Near-Earth Object Human Space Flight Accessible Targets Study (NHATS) lists. Our astrometric observations allow us to improve target orbits, making radar observations possible for objects with a short arc or large orbital uncertainty, which could be greater than the radar beam width. Astrometric measurements also allow for the detection and measurement of the Yarkovsky effect on NEOs. The photometric and spectroscopic data allows us to determine the light curve shape and amplitude, measure rotation periods, determine the taxonomic classification, and improve the overall characterization of these targets. We are also using a small amount of the LCO NEO Follow-up Network time to confirm newly detected NEO candidates produced by the major sky surveys such as ATLAS, Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) and PanSTARRS (PS1). We will describe the construction of the NEOexchange NEO follow-up portal and the development and deployment methodology adopted which allows the software to be packaged and deployed anywhere, including in off-site cloud services. This allows professionals, amateurs, and citizen scientists to plan, schedule and analyze NEO imaging and spectroscopy data using the LCO network and acts as a coordination hub for the NEO follow-up efforts. We illustrate the capabilities of NEOexchange and the LCO NEO Follow-up Network with examples of first period determinations for radar-targeted NEOs and its use to plan and execute multi-site photometric and spectroscopic observations of (66391) 1999 KW4, the subject of the most recent planetary defense exercise campaign.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021Icar..36414387L
The Palomar Transient Factory Core-collapse Supernova Host-galaxy Sample. I. Host-galaxy Distribution Functions and Environment Dependence of Core-collapse Supernovae;;Several thousand core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) of different flavors have been discovered so far. However, identifying their progenitors has remained an outstanding open question in astrophysics. Studies of SN host galaxies have proven to be powerful in providing constraints on the progenitor populations. In this paper, we present all CCSNe detected between 2009 and 2017 by the Palomar Transient Factory. This sample includes 888 SNe of 12 distinct classes out to redshift z ≈ 1. We present the photometric properties of their host galaxies from the far-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared and model the host-galaxy spectral energy distributions to derive physical properties. The galaxy mass function of Type Ic, Ib, IIb, II, and IIn SNe ranges from 10<SUP>5</SUP> to 10<SUP>11.5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, probing the entire mass range of star-forming galaxies down to the least-massive star-forming galaxies known. Moreover, the galaxy mass distributions are consistent with models of star-formation-weighted mass functions. Regular CCSNe are hence direct tracers of star formation. Small but notable differences exist between some of the SN classes. Type Ib/c SNe prefer galaxies with slightly higher masses (i.e., higher metallicities) and star formation rates than Type IIb and II SNe. These differences are less pronounced than previously thought. H-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and SNe Ic-BL are scarce in galaxies above 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Their progenitors require environments with metallicities of < 0.4 and < 1 solar, respectively. In addition, the hosts of H-poor SLSNe are dominated by a younger stellar population than all other classes of CCSNe. Our findings corroborate the notion that low metallicity and young age play an important role in the formation of SLSN progenitors.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..255...29S
A Deep-learning Approach for Live Anomaly Detection of Extragalactic Transients;;There is a shortage of multiwavelength and spectroscopic follow-up capabilities given the number of transient and variable astrophysical events discovered through wide-field optical surveys such as the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory and its associated Legacy Survey of Space and Time. From the haystack of potential science targets, astronomers must allocate scarce resources to study a selection of needles in real time. Here we present a variational recurrent autoencoder neural network to encode simulated Rubin Observatory extragalactic transient events using 1% of the PLAsTiCC data set to train the autoencoder. Our unsupervised method uniquely works with unlabeled, real-time, multivariate, and aperiodic data. We rank 1,129,184 events based on an anomaly score estimated using an isolation forest. We find that our pipeline successfully ranks rarer classes of transients as more anomalous. Using simple cuts in anomaly score and uncertainty, we identify a pure (≈95% pure) sample of rare transients (i.e., transients other than Type Ia, Type II, and Type Ibc supernovae), including superluminous and pair-instability supernovae. Finally, our algorithm is able to identify these transients as anomalous well before peak, enabling real-time follow-up studies in the era of the Rubin Observatory.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..255...24V
SNIascore: Deep-learning Classification of Low-resolution Supernova Spectra;;We present SNIascore, a deep-learning-based method for spectroscopic classification of thermonuclear supernovae (SNe Ia) based on very low-resolution (R ~ 100) data. The goal of SNIascore is the fully automated classification of SNe Ia with a very low false-positive rate (FPR) so that human intervention can be greatly reduced in large-scale SN classification efforts, such as that undertaken by the public Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey (BTS). We utilize a recurrent neural network architecture with a combination of bidirectional long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit layers. SNIascore achieves a <0.6% FPR while classifying up to 90% of the low-resolution SN Ia spectra obtained by the BTS. SNIascore simultaneously performs binary classification and predicts the redshifts of secure SNe Ia via regression (with a typical uncertainty of <0.005 in the range from z = 0.01 to z = 0.12). For the magnitude-limited ZTF BTS survey (≈70% SNe Ia), deploying SNIascore reduces the amount of spectra in need of human classification or confirmation by ≈60%. Furthermore, SNIascore allows SN Ia classifications to be automatically announced in real time to the public immediately following a finished observation during the night.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...917L...2F
The Blue Supergiant Progenitor of the Supernova Imposter AT 2019krl;;Extensive archival Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer Space Telescope, and Large Binocular Telescope imaging of the recent intermediate-luminosity transient, AT 2019krl in M74, reveal a bright optical and mid-infrared progenitor star. While the optical peak of the event was missed, a peak was detected in the infrared with an absolute magnitude of M<SUB>4.5 μm</SUB> = -18.4 mag, leading us to infer a visual-wavelength peak absolute magnitude of -13.5 to -14.5. The pre-discovery light curve indicated no outbursts over the previous 16 yr. The colors, magnitudes, and inferred temperatures of the progenitor best match a 13-14 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yellow or blue supergiant (BSG) if only foreground extinction is taken into account, or a hotter and more massive star if any additional local extinction is included. A pre-eruption spectrum of the star reveals strong Hα and [N II] emission with wings extending to ±2000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The post-eruption spectrum is fairly flat and featureless with only Hα, Na I D, [Ca II], and the Ca II triplet in emission. As in many previous intermediate-luminosity transients, AT 2019krl shows remarkable observational similarities to luminous blue variable (LBV) giant eruptions, SN 2008S-like events, and massive-star mergers. However, the information about the pre-eruption star favors either a relatively unobscured BSG or a more extinguished LBV with M > 20 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> likely viewed pole-on.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...917...63A
Recurring Planetary Debris Transits and Circumstellar Gas around White Dwarf ZTF J0328-1219;;We present follow-up photometry and spectroscopy of ZTF J0328-1219, strengthening its status as a white dwarf exhibiting transiting planetary debris. Using TESS and Zwicky Transient Facility photometry, along with follow-up high-speed photometry from various observatories, we find evidence for two significant periods of variability at 9.937 and 11.2 hr. We interpret these as most likely the orbital periods of different debris clumps. Changes in the detailed dip structures within the light curves are observed on nightly, weekly, and monthly timescales, reminiscent of the dynamic behavior observed in the first white dwarf discovered to harbor a disintegrating asteroid, WD 1145+017. We fit previously published spectroscopy along with broadband photometry to obtain new atmospheric parameters for the white dwarf, with M<SUB>⋆</SUB> = 0.731 ± 0.023 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 7630 ± 140 K, and [Ca/He] = - 9.55 ± 0.12. With new high-resolution spectroscopy, we detect prominent and narrow Na D absorption features likely of circumstellar origin, with velocities 21.4 ± 1.0 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> blueshifted relative to atmospheric lines. We attribute the periodically modulated photometric signal to dusty effluents from small orbiting bodies such as asteroids or comets, but we are unable to identify the most likely material that is being sublimated, or otherwise ejected, as the environmental temperatures range from roughly 400 to 700 K.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...917...41V
Illuminating Black Hole Subsystems in Young Star Clusters;;There is increasing evidence that globular clusters retain sizeable black hole populations at present day. This is supported by dynamical simulations of cluster evolution, which have unveiled the spatial distribution and mass spectrum of black holes in clusters across cosmic age. However, black hole populations of young, high metallicity clusters remain unconstrained. Black holes hosted by these clusters mass segregate early in their evolutionary history, forming central subsystems of hundreds to thousands of black holes. We argue that after supernova feedback has subsided (≳50 Myr), the host cluster can accumulate gas from its dense surroundings, from which the black hole subsystem accretes at highly enhanced rates. The collective accretion luminosity can be substantial and provides a novel observational constraint for young massive clusters. We test this hypothesis by performing 3D hydrodynamic simulations where we embed discretized potentials, representing our black holes, within the potential of a massive cluster. This system moves supersonically with respect to a gaseous medium from which it accretes. We study the accretion of this black hole subsystem for different subsystem populations and determine the integrated accretion luminosity of the black hole subsystem. We apply our results to the young massive clusters of the Antennae Galaxies and find that a typical subsystem accretion luminosity should be in excess of ≈ 10<SUP>40</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We argue that no strong candidates of this luminous signal have been observed and constrain the subsystem population of a typical cluster in the Antennae Galaxies to ≲ 10-2 × 10<SUP>2</SUP> 10 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> black holes, given that feedback does not significantly impede accretion and that the gas remains optically thin.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...917...36K
Kilonova Emission from Black Hole-Neutron Star Mergers. II. Luminosity Function and Implications for Target-of-opportunity Observations of Gravitational-wave Triggers and Blind Searches;;We present detailed simulations of the kilonova and gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow and kilonova luminosity function from black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) mergers, and discuss the detectability of an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart in connection with gravitational wave (GW) detections, GW-triggered target-of-opportunity observations, and time-domain blind searches. The predicted absolute magnitude of BH-NS kilonovae at 0.5 days after the merger falls in the range [-10, -15.5]. The simulated luminosity function contains potential information on the viewing-angle distribution of the anisotropic kilonova emission. We simulate the GW detection rates, detectable distances, and signal duration for future networks of 2nd/2.5th/3rd generation GW detectors. BH-NSs tend to produce brighter kilonovae and afterglows if the BH has a higher aligned spin, and a less massive NS with a stiffer equation of state. The detectability of kilonovae is especially sensitive to the BH spin. If BHs typically have low spins, the BH-NS EM counterparts are hard to discover. For 2nd generation GW detector networks, a limiting magnitude of m<SUB>limit</SUB> ~ 23-24 mag is required to detect kilonovae even if high BH spin is assumed. Thus, a plausible explanation for the lack of BH-NS-associated kilonova detection during LIGO/Virgo O3 is that either there is no EM counterpart (plunging events) or the current follow-ups are too shallow. These observations still have the chance to detect the on-axis jet afterglow associated with a short GRB or an orphan afterglow. Follow-up observations can detect possible associated short GRB afterglows, from which kilonova signatures may be studied. For time-domain observations, a high-cadence search in redder filters is recommended to detect more BH-NS-associated kilonovae and afterglows.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...917...24Z
Discovery of a Fast Iron Low-ionization Outflow in the Early Evolution of the Nearby Tidal Disruption Event AT 2019qiz;;We report the results of ultraviolet (UV) and optical photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT 2019qiz. Our follow-up observations started <10 days after the source began to brighten in the optical and lasted for a period of six months. Our late-time host-dominated spectrum indicates that the host galaxy likely harbors a weak active galactic nucleus. The initial Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectrum of AT 2019qiz exhibits an iron and low-ionization broad absorption line (FeLoBAL) system that is seen for the first time in a TDE. This spectrum also bears a striking resemblance to that of Gaia16apd, a superluminous supernova. Our observations provide insights into the outflow properties in TDEs and show evidence for a connection between TDEs and engine-powered supernovae at early phases, as originally suggested by Metzger & Stone. In a time frame of 50 days, the UV spectra of AT 2019qiz started to resemble those of previous TDEs with only high-ionization broad absorption lines. The change in UV spectral signatures is accompanied by a decrease in the outflow velocity, which began at 15,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and decelerated to ~10,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. A similar evolution in the H&agr; emission-line width further supports the speculation that the broad Balmer emission lines are formed in TDE outflows. In addition, we detect narrow absorption features on top of the FeLoBAL signatures in the early HST UV spectrum of AT 2019qiz. The measured H I column density corresponds to a Lyman-limit system, whereas the metal absorption lines (such as N V, C IV, Fe II, and Mg II) are likely probing the circumnuclear gas and interstellar medium in the host galaxy.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...917....9H
Accretion-modified Stars in Accretion Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei: Gravitational-wave Bursts and Electromagnetic Counterparts from Merging Stellar Black Hole Binaries;;The recent advanced LIGO/Virgo detections of gravitational waves (GWs) from stellar binary black hole (BBH) mergers, in particular GW190521, which is potentially associated with a quasar, have stimulated renewed interest in active galactic nuclei as factories of merging BBHs. Compact objects evolving from massive stars are unavoidably enshrouded by a massive envelope to form accretion-modified stars (AMSs) in the dense gaseous environment of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion disk. We show that most AMSs form binaries due to gravitational interaction with each other during radial migration in the SMBH disk, forming BBHs inside the AMS. When a BBH is born, its orbit is initially governed by the tidal torque of the SMBH. Bondi accretion onto a BBH at a hyper-Eddington rate naturally develops and then controls the evolution of its orbits. We find that Bondi accretion leads to efficient removal of the orbital angular momentum of the binary, whose final merger produces a GW burst. Meanwhile, the Blandford-Znajek mechanism pumps the spin energy of the merged BH to produce an electromagnetic counterpart (EMC). Moreover, hyper-Eddington accretion onto the BBH develops powerful outflows and triggers a Bondi explosion, which manifests itself as an EMC of the GW burst, depending on the viscosity of the accretion flow. Thermal emission from the Bondi sphere appears as one of the EMCs. The BBHs radiate GWs with frequencies of ~10<SUP>2</SUP> Hz, which are accessible to LIGO.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...916L..17W
Cooling Models for the Most Massive White Dwarfs;;We present a set of ultramassive white dwarf models, focused on masses above 1.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Given the uncertainties about the formation and compositions of such objects, we construct parameterized model sequences, guided by evolutionary calculations including both single star and double white dwarf merger formation channels. We demonstrate that the cooling of objects with central densities in excess of 10<SUP>9</SUP> g cm<SUP>-3</SUP> is dominated by neutrino cooling via the Urca process in the first ≈100 Myr after formation. Our models indicate that the recently discovered ultramassive white dwarf ZTF J190132.9+145808.7 is likely to have experienced this Urca-dominated cooling regime. We also show that the high densities imply that diffusion is unlikely to significantly alter the core compositions of these objects before they crystallize.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...916..119S
Zwicky Transient Facility and Globular Clusters: the Period-Luminosity and Period-Luminosity-Color Relations for Late-type Contact Binaries;;In this work, we aimed to derive the gri-band period-luminosity (PL) and period-luminosity-color (PLC) relations for late-type contact binaries, for the first time, located in globular clusters, using the homogeneous light curves collected by the Zwicky Transient Factory (ZTF). We started with 79 contact binaries in 15 globular clusters, and retained 30 contact binaries in 10 globular clusters that have adequate numbers of data points in the ZTF light curves and are unaffected by blending. Magnitudes at mean and maximum light of these contact binaries were determined using a fourth-order Fourier expansion, while extinction corrections were done using the Bayerstar2019 3D reddening map together with adopting the homogeneous distances to their host globular clusters. After removing early-type and "anomaly" contact binaries, our derived gri-band PL and period-Wesenheit (PW) relations exhibited a much larger dispersion with large errors on the fitted coefficients. Nevertheless, the gr-band PL and PW relations based on this small sample of contact binaries in globular clusters were consistent with those based on a larger sample of nearby contact binaries. Good agreements of the PL and PW relations suggested both samples of contact binaries in the local Solar neighborhood and in the distant globular clusters can be combined and used to derive and calibrate the PL, PW, and PLC relations. The final derived gr-band PL, PW, and PLC relations were much improved over those based on the limited sample of contact binaries in the globular clusters.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162...63N
SN 2020bqj: A Type Ibn supernova with a long-lasting peak plateau;;Context. Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn) are a rare class of stripped envelope supernovae interacting with a helium-rich circumstellar medium (CSM). The majority of the SNe Ibn reported in the literature display a surprising homogeneity in their fast-evolving lightcurves and are typically found in actively starforming spiral galaxies. 
 Aims: We present the discovery and the study of SN 2020bqj (ZTF20aalrqbu), a SN Ibn with a long-duration peak plateau lasting 40 days and hosted by a faint low-mass galaxy. We aim to explain its peculiar properties using an extensive photometric and spectroscopic data set. 
 Methods: We compare the photometric and spectral evolution of SN 2020bqj with regular SNe Ibn from the literature, as well as with other outliers in the SN Ibn subclass. We fit the bolometric and multi-band lightcurves with powering mechanism models such as radioactive decay and CSM interaction. We also model the host galaxy of SN 2020bqj. 
 Results: The risetime, peak magnitude and spectral features of SN 2020bqj are consistent with those of most SNe Ibn, but the SN is a clear outlier in the subclass based on its bright, long-lasting peak plateau and the low mass of its faint host galaxy. We show through modeling that the lightcurve of SN 2020bqj can be powered predominantly by shock heating from the interaction of the SN ejecta and a dense CSM, combined with radioactive decay. The peculiar Type Ibn SN 2011hw is a close analog to SN 2020bqj in terms of lightcurve and spectral evolution, suggesting a similar progenitor and CSM scenario. In this scenario a very massive progenitor star in the transitional phase between a luminous blue variable and a compact Wolf-Rayet star undergoes core-collapse, embedded in a dense helium-rich CSM with an elevated opacity compared to normal SNe Ibn, due to the presence of residual hydrogen. This scenario is consistent with the observed properties of SN 2020bqj and the modeling results. 
 Conclusions: SN 2020bqj is a compelling example of a transitional SN Ibn/IIn based on not only its spectral features, but also its lightcurve, host galaxy properties and the inferred progenitor properties. The strong similarity with SN 2011hw suggests this subclass may be the result of a progenitor in a stellar evolution phase that is distinct from those of progenitors of regular SNe Ibn.

Gaia Early Data Release 3. Gaia photometric science alerts;;Context. Since July 2014, the Gaia mission has been engaged in a high-spatial-resolution, time-resolved, precise, accurate astrometric, and photometric survey of the entire sky. 
 Aims: We present the Gaia Science Alerts project, which has been in operation since 1 June 2016. We describe the system which has been developed to enable the discovery and publication of transient photometric events as seen by Gaia. 
 Methods: We outline the data handling, timings, and performances, and we describe the transient detection algorithms and filtering procedures needed to manage the high false alarm rate. We identify two classes of events: (1) sources which are new to Gaia and (2) Gaia sources which have undergone a significant brightening or fading. Validation of the Gaia transit astrometry and photometry was performed, followed by testing of the source environment to minimise contamination from Solar System objects, bright stars, and fainter near-neighbours. 
 Results: We show that the Gaia Science Alerts project suffers from very low contamination, that is there are very few false-positives. We find that the external completeness for supernovae, C<SUB>E</SUB> = 0.46, is dominated by the Gaia scanning law and the requirement of detections from both fields-of-view. Where we have two or more scans the internal completeness is C<SUB>I</SUB> = 0.79 at 3 arcsec or larger from the centres of galaxies, but it drops closer in, especially within 1 arcsec. 
 Conclusions: The per-transit photometry for Gaia transients is precise to 1% at G = 13, and 3% at G = 19. The per-transit astrometry is accurate to 55 mas when compared to Gaia DR2. The Gaia Science Alerts project is one of the most homogeneous and productive transient surveys in operation, and it is the only survey which covers the whole sky at high spatial resolution (subarcsecond), including the Galactic plane and bulge.

The NAROO digitization center. Overview and scientific program;;The New Astrometric Reduction of Old Observations (NAROO) center can be found at the Paris Observatory in Meudon, and it is dedicated to the measurement of astrophotographic plates and the analysis of old observations. The NAROO digitizer consists of a granite-based Newport-Microcontrol open-frame air-bearing XY positioning table, a scientific sCMOS camera, and a telecentric optical system. The plate holder assembly is suited for mounting glass plates up to 350 mm squared. The machine positioning stability is better than 15 nm, and its repeatability is better than 40 nm. With real photographic plate data, we were able to produce measurements with an accuracy better than 65 nm. The renewed interest about photographic plates concerns the expansion of the database of transient objects evolving in time, since digitization now makes it possible to measure images with a high level of accuracy and to identify all the available objects. The information extracted from such materials can be of an astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic nature, when not purely imaging, with consequences in planetology, near-Earth asteroid risk assessment, astrophysical phenomena, and general relativity, to mention but a few. Through our scientific program in the Gaia era, we detail examples of current and upcoming uses for the community. We invite researchers to use our facilities and digitize their collection by answering our call for proposals.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...652A...3R
The potential role of binary neutron star merger afterglows in multimessenger cosmology;;Binary neutron star mergers offer a new and independent means of measuring the Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB> by combining the gravitational-wave inferred source luminosity distance with its redshift obtained from electromagnetic follow-up. This method is limited by the intrinsic degeneracy between the system distance and orbital inclination in the gravitational-wave signal. Observing the afterglow counterpart to a merger can further constrain the inclination angle, allowing this degeneracy to be partially lifted and improving the measurement of H<SUB>0</SUB>. In the case of the binary neutron star merger GW170817, afterglow light-curve and imaging modeling thus allowed the H<SUB>0</SUB> measurement to be improved by a factor of three. However, systematic access to afterglow data is far from guaranteed. In fact, though each one allows a leap in H<SUB>0</SUB> precision, these afterglow counterparts should prove rare in forthcoming multimessenger campaigns. We combine models for emission and detection of gravitational-wave and electromagnetic radiation from binary neutron star mergers with realistic population models and estimates for afterglow inclination angle constraints. Using these models, we quantify how fast H<SUB>0</SUB> will be narrowed down by successive multimessenger events with and without the afterglow. We find that because of its rareness and though it greatly refines angle estimates, the afterglow counterpart should not significantly contribute to the measurement of H<SUB>0</SUB> in the long run.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...652A...1M
Discovery and confirmation of the shortest gamma-ray burst from a collapsar;;Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the brightest and most energetic events in the Universe. The duration and hardness distribution of GRBs has two clusters<SUP>1</SUP>, now understood to reflect (at least) two different progenitors<SUP>2</SUP>. Short-hard GRBs (SGRBs; T<SUB>90</SUB> < 2 s) arise from compact binary mergers, and long-soft GRBs (LGRBs; T<SUB>90</SUB> > 2 s) have been attributed to the collapse of peculiar massive stars (collapsars)<SUP>3</SUP>. The discovery of SN 1998bw/GRB 980425 (ref. <SUP>4</SUP>) marked the first association of an LGRB with a collapsar, and AT 2017gfo (ref. <SUP>5</SUP>)/GRB 170817A/GW170817 (ref. <SUP>6</SUP>) marked the first association of an SGRB with a binary neutron star merger, which also produced a gravitational wave. Here, we present the discovery of ZTF20abwysqy (AT2020scz), a fast-fading optical transient in the Fermi satellite and the Interplanetary Network localization regions of GRB 200826A; X-ray and radio emission further confirm that this is the afterglow. Follow-up imaging (at rest-frame 16.5 days) reveals excess emission above the afterglow that cannot be explained as an underlying kilonova, but which is consistent with being the supernova. Although the GRB duration is short (rest-frame T<SUB>90</SUB> of 0.65 s), our panchromatic follow-up data confirm a collapsar origin. GRB 200826A is the shortest LGRB found with an associated collapsar; it appears to sit on the brink between a successful and a failed collapsar. Our discovery is consistent with the hypothesis that most collapsars fail to produce ultra-relativistic jets.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatAs...5..917A
A peculiarly short-duration gamma-ray burst from massive star core collapse;;Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been phenomenologically classified into long and short populations based on the observed bimodal distribution of duration<SUP>1</SUP>. Multi-wavelength and multi-messenger observations in recent years have revealed that in general long GRBs originate from massive star core collapse events<SUP>2</SUP>, whereas short GRBs originate from binary neutron star mergers<SUP>3</SUP>. It has been known that the duration criterion is sometimes unreliable, and multi-wavelength criteria are needed to identify the physical origin of a particular GRB<SUP>4</SUP>. Some apparently long GRBs have been suggested to have a neutron star merger origin<SUP>5</SUP>, whereas some apparently short GRBs have been attributed to genuinely long GRBs<SUP>6</SUP> whose short, bright emission is slightly above the detector's sensitivity threshold. Here, we report the comprehensive analysis of the multi-wavelength data of the short, bright GRB 200826A. Characterized by a sharp pulse, this burst shows a duration of 1 second and no evidence of an underlying longer-duration event. Its other observational properties such as its spectral behaviours, total energy and host galaxy offset are, however, inconsistent with those of other short GRBs believed to originate from binary neutron star mergers. Rather, these properties resemble those of long GRBs. This burst confirms the existence of short-duration GRBs with stellar core-collapse origin<SUP>4</SUP>, and presents some challenges to the existing models.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatAs...5..911Z
Hierarchical mergers of stellar-mass black holes and their gravitational-wave signatures;;While most of the compact-binary mergers detected by LIGO and Virgo are expected to consist of first-generation black holes formed from the collapse of stars, others might instead be of second (or higher) generation, containing the remnants of previous black-hole mergers. We review theoretical findings, astrophysical modelling and current gravitational-wave evidence of hierarchical stellar-mass black-hole mergers. Such a subpopulation of hierarchically assembled black holes presents distinctive gravitational-wave signatures, namely higher masses, possibly within the pair-instability mass gap, and dimensionless spins clustered at the characteristic value of ~0.7. To produce hierarchical mergers, astrophysical environments need to overcome the relativistic recoils imparted to black-hole merger remnants, a condition that prefers hosts with escape speeds of ≳100 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>. Promising locations for efficient production of hierarchical mergers include nuclear star clusters and accretion disks surrounding active galactic nuclei, though environments that are less efficient at retaining merger products such as globular clusters may still contribute significantly to the detectable population of repeated mergers. While GW190521 is the single most promising hierarchical-merger candidate to date, constraints from large population analyses are becoming increasingly more powerful.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatAs...5..749G
The observable supernova rate in galaxy-galaxy lensing systems with the TESS satellite;;The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is the latest observational effort to find exoplanets and map bright transient optical phenomena. Supernovae (SNe) are particularly interesting as cosmological standard candles for cosmological distance measures. The limiting magnitude of TESS strongly constrains SN detection to the very nearby Universe (m ~ 19, z < 0.05). We explore the possibility that more distant SNe that are gravitationally lensed and magnified by a foreground galaxy can be detected by TESS, an opportunity to measure the time delay between light paths and constrain the Hubble constant independently. We estimate the rate of occurrence of such systems, assuming reasonable distributions of magnification, host dust attenuation, and redshift. There are approximately 16 Type Ia SNe (SNIa) and 43 core-collapse SNe (SNcc) expected to be observable with TESS each year, which translates to 18 and 43 per cent chance of detection per year, respectively. Monitoring the largest collections of known strong galaxy-galaxy lenses from Petrillo et al., this translates into 0.6 and 1.3 per cent chances of an SNIa and an SNcc per year. The TESS all-sky detection rates are lower than those of the Zwicky Transient Facility and Vera Rubin Observatory. However, on the ecliptic poles, TESS performs almost as well as its all-sky search, thanks to its continuous coverage: 2 and 4 per cent chance of an observed SN (Ia or cc) each year. These rates argue for timely processing of full-frame TESS imaging to facilitate follow-up and should motivate further searches for low-redshift lensing system.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.1316H
Year 1 of the ZTF high-cadence Galactic plane survey: strategy, goals, and early results on new single-mode hot subdwarf B-star pulsators;;We present the goals, strategy, and first results of the high-cadence Galactic plane survey using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The goal of the survey is to unveil the Galactic population of short-period variable stars, including short-period binaries, and stellar pulsators with periods less than a few hours. Between 2018 June and 2019 January, we observed 64 ZTF fields resulting in 2990 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of high stellar density in the ZTF-r band along the Galactic plane. Each field was observed continuously for 1.5 to 6 h with a cadence of 40 sec. Most fields have between 200 and 400 observations obtained over 2-3 continuous nights. As part of this survey, we extract a total of ≈230 million individual objects with at least 80 epochs obtained during the high-cadence Galactic plane survey reaching an average depth of ZTF-r ≈ 20.5 mag. For four selected fields with 2-10 million individual objects per field, we calculate different variability statistics and find that ≈1-2 per cent of the objects are astrophysically variable over the observed period. We present a progress report on recent discoveries, including a new class of compact pulsators, the first members of a new class of Roche lobe filling hot subdwarf binaries as well as new ultracompact double white dwarfs and flaring stars. Finally, we present a sample of 12 new single-mode hot subdwarf B-star pulsators with pulsation amplitudes between ZTF-r = 20-76 mmag and pulsation periods between P = 5.8-16 min with a strong cluster of systems with periods ≈6 min. All of the data have now been released in either ZTF Data Release 3 or Data Release 4.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.1254K
A novel bivariate autoregressive model for predicting and forecasting irregularly observed time series;;In several disciplines, it is common to find time series measured at irregular observational times. In particular, in astronomy there are a large number of surveys that gather information over irregular time gaps and in more than one passband. Some examples are Pan-STARRS, ZTF, and also the LSST. However, current commonly used time series models that estimate the time dependence in astronomical light curves consider the information of each band separately (e.g, CIAR, IAR, and CARMA models) disregarding the dependence that might exist between different passbands. In this paper, we propose a novel bivariate model for irregularly sampled time series, called the Bivariate Irregular Autoregressive (BIAR) model. The BIAR model assumes an autoregressive structure on each time series; it is stationary, and it allows to estimate the autocorrelation, the cross-correlation and the contemporary correlation between two unequally spaced time series. We implemented the BIAR model on light curves, in the g and r bands, obtained from the ZTF alerts processed by the ALeRCE broker. We show that if the light curves of the two bands are highly correlated, the model has more accurate forecast and prediction using the bivariate model than a similar method that uses only univariate information. Further, the estimated parameters of the BIAR are useful to characterize long-period variable stars and to distinguish between classes of stochastic objects, providing promising features that can be used for classification purposes.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.1105E
The outburst of a 60 min AM CVn reveals peculiar colour evolution: implications for outbursts in long-period double white dwarfs;;We report on multiwavelength observations during quiescence and of the first detected outburst of the ≈60 min orbital period AM CVn SDSS J113732+405458. Using X-ray and UV observations, we determined an upper limit duration of the event of about 1 yr. The amplitude of the outburst was remarkably small, of around 1 mag in r and 0.5 mag in g. We have also investigated the colour variations of SDSS J113732+405458 and other long-period AM CVns in outbursts and identified a track on the colour-magnitude diagram that is not compatible with the predictions of the disc instability model, suggesting that some outbursts in long-period AM CVns are caused by enhanced mass-transfer. To our knowledge, these are the first studies of the colour evolution in AM CVns. During quiescence we measured an X-ray luminosity for SDSS J113732+405458 of ≈3 × 10<SUP>29</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> in the 0.5-10 keV band. This indicates a very low accretion rate, in agreement with the disc instability model for long-period systems. However, such a model predicts stable discs at somewhat long periods. The discovery of this system outburst, along with similarities to the long-period system SDSS J080710+485259 with a comparably long, weak outburst, indicates that these enhanced mass-transfer events may be more common in long-period AM CVns. A larger sample would be needed to determine empirically at what period, if any, the disc instability stops functioning entirely. Finally, we identified an infrared excess in the quiescence spectrum attributable to the donor. This makes SDSS J113732+405458 the second AM CVn to have a directly detected donor.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505..215R
Correlated time variability of multicomponent high-velocity outflows in J162122.54+075808.4;;We present a detailed analysis of time variability of two distinct C IV broad absorption line (BAL) components seen in the spectrum of J162122.54+075808.4 (z<SUB>em</SUB> = 2.1394) using observations from SDSS, NTT, and SALT taken at seven different epochs spanning about 15 yr. The blue-BAL component (with an ejection velocity, $v_{\rm e}\sim 37\, 500$ km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) is an emerging absorption that shows equivalent width variations and kinematic shifts consistent with acceleration. The red-BAL component ($v_{\rm e} \sim 15\, 400$ km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) is a three-component absorption. One of the components is emerging and subsequently disappearing. The two other components show kinematic shifts consistent with acceleration coupled with equivalent width variability. Interestingly, we find the kinematic shifts and equivalent width variability of the blue- and red-BAL components to be correlated. While the C IV emission-line flux varies by more than 17 per cent during our monitoring period, the available light curves (covering rest frame 1300-2300 Å) do not show more than a 0.1 mag variability in the continuum. This suggests that the variations in the ionizing flux are larger than that of the near-ultraviolet flux. However, the correlated variability seen between different BAL components cannot be explained solely by photoionization models without structural changes. In the framework of disc wind models, any changes in the radial profiles of density and/or velocity triggered either by disc instabilities or by changes in the ionizing radiation can explain our observations. High-resolution spectroscopic monitoring of J1621+0758 is important to understand the physical conditions of the absorbing gas and thereby to constrain the parameters of disc wind models.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.5975A
Double common envelope jets supernovae (CEJSNe) by triple-star systems;;I propose a new type of common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) events where instead of a single neutron star (NS; or a black hole; BH) a tight binary system of an NS and a main-sequence star enters a common envelope evolution (CEE) with a red supergiant. The NS and the main-sequence star of the tight binary system merge inside the red supergiant envelope and enter a CEE of their own. The NS accretes some mass through an accretion disc and launches jets that explodes the main-sequence star. I estimate that the two jets that the NS launches at this phase carry an energy of $\approx 10^{52} {~\rm erg}$, about the same order of magnitude as the energy that the jets will carry when the NS or its BH remnant will enter the core in a later phase. For that, I term the entire event a double CEJSN. The outcome of the double CEJSN is a very long, months to years, and very energetic event, a total energy of $\approx 10^{52} \!-\! 10^{53} {~\rm erg}$, that will be observationally classified as a peculiar superenergetic event. I crudely estimate that new transient surveys should detect about one CEJSN event from a triple-star system per year.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.5967S
Search for dormant black holes in ellipsoidal variables - III. The OGLE BULGE short-period sample;;This is the third of a series of papers that presents an algorithm to search for close binaries with massive, possibly compact, unseen secondaries. The detection of such a binary is based on identifying a star that displays a large ellipsoidal periodic modulation, induced by tidal interaction with its companion. In the second paper of the series, we presented a simple approach to derive a robust modified minimum mass ratio (mMMR), based on the observed ellipsoidal amplitude, without knowing the primary mass and radius, assuming the primary fills its Roche lobe. The newly defined mMMR is always smaller than the actual mass ratio. Therefore, a binary with an mMMR larger than unity is a good candidate for having a massive secondary, which might be a black hole or a neutron star. This paper considers 10 956 OGLE short-period ellipsoidals observed towards the Galactic bulge. We re-analyse their modulation and identify 136 main-sequence systems with mMMR significantly larger than unity as candidates for having compact-object secondaries, assuming their observed periodic modulations reflect indeed the ellipsoidal effect. Obviously, one needs follow-up observations to find out the true nature of these companions.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.5907G
The double-peaked Type Ic supernova 2019cad: another SN 2005bf-like object;;We present the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of supernova (SN) 2019cad during the first ~100 d from explosion. Based on the light-curve morphology, we find that SN 2019cad resembles the double-peaked Type Ib/c SN 2005bf and the Type Ic PTF11mnb. Unlike those two objects, SN 2019cad also shows the initial peak in the redder bands. Inspection of the g-band light curve indicates the initial peak is reached in ~8 d, while the r-band peak occurred ~15 d post-explosion. A second and more prominent peak is reached in all bands at ~45 d past explosion, followed by a fast decline from ~60 d. During the first 30 d, the spectra of SN 2019cad show the typical features of a Type Ic SN, however, after 40 d, a blue continuum with prominent lines of Si II λ6355 and C II λ6580 is observed again. Comparing the bolometric light curve to hydrodynamical models, we find that SN 2019cad is consistent with a pre-SN mass of 11 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and an explosion energy of 3.5 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg. The light-curve morphology can be reproduced either by a double-peaked <SUP>56</SUP>Ni distribution with an external component of 0.041 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and an internal component of 0.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> or a double-peaked <SUP>56</SUP>Ni distribution plus magnetar model (P ~ 11 ms and B ~ 26 × 10<SUP>14</SUP> G). If SN 2019cad were to suffer from significant host reddening (which cannot be ruled out), the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni model would require extreme values, while the magnetar model would still be feasible.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.4907G
Galactic open cluster Cepheids - a census based on Gaia EDR3;;In the Gaia era, the membership analysis and parameter determination of open clusters (OCs) are more accurate. We performed a census of OC's classical Cepheids based on Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) and obtained a sample of 33 OC Cepheids fulfilling the constraints of the spatial position, proper motion, parallax, and evolution state. 13 of 33 OC Cepheids are newly discovered. Among them, CM Sct is the first first-crossing Cepheid with direct evidence of evolution. DP Vel is likely a fourth- or fifth-crossing Cepheid. Based on independent distances from OCs, W<SUB>1</SUB>-band period-luminosity relation of Cepheids is determined with a 3.5 per cent accuracy: <M<SUB>W1</SUB>> = -(3.274 ± 0.090)log P - (- 2.567 ± 0.080). The $Gaia$-band period-Wesenheit relation agrees well with Ripepi et al. (2019). A direct period-age relation for fundamental Cepheids are also determined based on OC's age, that is log t = -(0.638 ± 0.063)log P + (8.569 ± 0.057).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.4768Z
PyTorchDIA: a flexible, GPU-accelerated numerical approach to Difference Image Analysis;;We present a GPU-accelerated numerical approach for fast kernel and differential background solutions. The model image proposed in the Bramich Difference Image Analysis (DIA) algorithm is analogous to a very simple convolutional neural network (CNN), with a single convolutional filter (i.e. the kernel) and an added scalar bias (i.e. the differential background). Here, we do not solve for the discrete pixel array in the classical, analytical linear least-squares sense. Instead, by making use of PyTorch tensors (GPU compatible multidimensional matrices) and associated deep learning tools, we solve for the kernel via an inherently massively parallel optimization. By casting the DIA problem as a GPU-accelerated optimization that utilizes automatic differentiation tools, our algorithm is both flexible to the choice of scalar objective function, and can perform DIA on astronomical data sets at least an order of magnitude faster than its classical analogue. More generally, we demonstrate that tools developed for machine learning can be used to address generic data analysis and modelling problems.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.3561H
On the role of resonances in polluting white dwarfs by asteroids;;Pollution of white dwarf atmospheres may be caused by asteroids that originate from the locations of secular and mean-motion resonances in planetary systems. Asteroids in these locations experience increased eccentricity, leading to tidal disruption by the white dwarf. We examine how the ν<SUB>6</SUB> secular resonance shifts outwards into a previously stable region of the asteroid belt, as the star evolves to a white dwarf. Analytic secular models require a planet to be engulfed in order to shift the resonance. We show with numerical simulations that as a planet gets engulfed by the evolving star, the secular resonance shifts and the rate of tidal disruption events increases with the engulfed planet's mass and its orbital separation. We also investigate the behaviour of mean-motion resonances. The width of a mean-motion resonance increases as the star loses mass and becomes a white dwarf. The ν<SUB>6</SUB> secular resonance is more efficient at driving tidal disruptions than mean-motion resonances with Jupiter. By examining 230 observed exoplanetary systems whose central star will evolve into a white dwarf, we find that along with an Earth mass planet at $1\, \rm au$, hot Jupiters at a semimajor axis $arsim 0.05\, \rm au$ and super-Earths of mass $10\, \rm M_\oplus$ at $arsim 0.3\, \rm au$ represent planet types whose engulfment shifts resonances enough to cause pollution of the white dwarfs to a degree in agreement with observations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.3375S
In the realm of the Hubble tension-a review of solutions;;The simplest ΛCDM model provides a good fit to a large span of cosmological data but harbors large areas of phenomenology and ignorance. With the improvement of the number and the accuracy of observations, discrepancies among key cosmological parameters of the model have emerged. The most statistically significant tension is the 4σ to 6σ disagreement between predictions of the Hubble constant, H <SUB>0</SUB>, made by the early time probes in concert with the 'vanilla' ΛCDM cosmological model, and a number of late time, model-independent determinations of H <SUB>0</SUB> from local measurements of distances and redshifts. The high precision and consistency of the data at both ends present strong challenges to the possible solution space and demands a hypothesis with enough rigor to explain multiple observations-whether these invoke new physics, unexpected large-scale structures or multiple, unrelated errors. A thorough review of the problem including a discussion of recent Hubble constant estimates and a summary of the proposed theoretical solutions is presented here. We include more than 1000 references, indicating that the interest in this area has grown considerably just during the last few years. We classify the many proposals to resolve the tension in these categories: early dark energy, late dark energy, dark energy models with 6 degrees of freedom and their extensions, models with extra relativistic degrees of freedom, models with extra interactions, unified cosmologies, modified gravity, inflationary models, modified recombination history, physics of the critical phenomena, and alternative proposals. Some are formally successful, improving the fit to the data in light of their additional degrees of freedom, restoring agreement within 1-2σ between Planck 2018, using the cosmic microwave background power spectra data, baryon acoustic oscillations, Pantheon SN data, and R20, the latest SH0ES Team Riess, et al (2021 Astrophys. J. 908 L6) measurement of the Hubble constant (H <SUB>0</SUB> = 73.2 ± 1.3 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> at 68% confidence level). However, there are many more unsuccessful models which leave the discrepancy well above the 3σ disagreement level. In many cases, reduced tension comes not simply from a change in the value of H <SUB>0</SUB> but also due to an increase in its uncertainty due to degeneracy with additional physics, complicating the picture and pointing to the need for additional probes. While no specific proposal makes a strong case for being highly likely or far better than all others, solutions involving early or dynamical dark energy, neutrino interactions, interacting cosmologies, primordial magnetic fields, and modified gravity provide the best options until a better alternative comes along. * In honor of the seminal work by E Hubble [];;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021CQGra..38o3001D
On the Binary Neutron Star Post-merger Magnetar Origin of XRT 210423;;XRT 201423 is an X-ray transient with a nearly flat plateau lasting 4.1 ks followed by a steep decay. This feature indicates that it might come from a magnetar formed through a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, similar to CDF-S XT2 and as predicted as a type of electromagnetic counterpart of BNS mergers. We test the compliance of the data with this model and use the observed duration and flux of the X-ray signal as well as upper limits of optical emission to pose constraints on the parameters of the underlying putative magnetar. Both the free zone and trapped zone geometric configurations are considered. We find that the data are generally consistent with such a model.

The nondetection of an optical counterpart places a conservative lower limit on the distance of the source, i.e., z > 0.045 regardless of the geometric configuration.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...915L..11A
The Exotic Type Ic Broad-lined Supernova SN 2018gep: Blurring the Line between Supernovae and Fast Optical Transients;;In the last decade a number of rapidly evolving transients have been discovered that are not easily explained by traditional supernova models. We present optical and UV data on one such object, SN 2018gep, that displayed a fast rise with a mostly featureless blue continuum around peak, and evolved to develop broad features typical of an SN Ic-bl while retaining significant amounts of blue flux throughout its observations. This blue excess is most evident in its near-UV flux, which is over 4 mag brighter than other stripped-envelope supernovae, and is still visible in optical g-r colors. Its fast rise time of t<SUB>rise,V</SUB> = 5.6 ± 0.5 days puts it squarely in the emerging class of Fast Evolving Luminous Transients, or Fast Blue Optical Transients. With a peak absolute magnitude of M<SUB>v</SUB> = -19.53 ± 0.23 mag it is on the extreme end of both the rise time and peak magnitude distribution for SNe Ic-bl. These observations are consistent with a simple SN Ic-bl model that has an additional form of energy injection at early times that drives the observed rapid, blue rise. We show that SN 2018gep and the literature SN iPTF16asu have similar photometric and spectroscopic properties and that they overall share many similarities with both SNe Ic-bl and Fast Evolving Transients. Based on our SN 2018gep host galaxy data we derive a number of properties, and we show that the derived host galaxy properties for both SN 2018gep and iPTF16asu are consistent with the SNe Ic-bl and gamma-ray burst/supernova sample while being on the extreme edge of the observed Fast Evolving Transient sample.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...915..121P
Fast Blue Optical Transients Due to Circumstellar Interaction and the Mysterious Supernova SN 2018gep;;The discovery of SN 2018gep (ZTF 18abukavn) challenged our understanding of the late-phase evolution of massive stars and their supernovae (SNe). The fast rise in luminosity of this SN (spectroscopically classified as a broad-lined Type Ic SN) indicates that the ejecta interacts with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM), while an additional energy source such as <SUP>56</SUP>Ni decay is required to explain the late-time light curve. These features hint at the explosion of a massive star with pre-SN mass loss. In this work, we examine the physical origins of rapidly evolving astrophysical transients like SN 2018gep. We investigate the wave-driven mass-loss mechanism and how it depends on model parameters such as progenitor mass and deposition energy, searching for stellar progenitor models that can reproduce the observational data. A model with an ejecta mass ~2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, explosion energy ~10<SUP>52</SUP> erg, a CSM of mass ~0.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radius ~1000 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and a <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass ~0.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> provides a good fit to the bolometric light curve. We also examine how interaction-powered light curves depend more generally on these parameters and how ejecta velocities can help break degeneracies. We find both wave-driven mass loss and mass ejection via pulsational pair instability can plausibly create the dense CSM in SN 2018gep, but we favor the latter possibility.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...915...80L
ASTRONOMALY: Personalised active anomaly detection in astronomical data;;Survey telescopes such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Square Kilometre Array will discover billions of static and dynamic astronomical sources. Properly mined, these enormous datasets will likely be wellsprings of rare or unknown astrophysical phenomena. The challenge is that the datasets are so large that most data will never be seen by human eyes; currently the most robust instrument we have to detect relevant anomalies. Machine learning is a useful tool for anomaly detection in this regime. However, it struggles to distinguish between interesting anomalies and irrelevant data such as instrumental artefacts or rare astronomical sources that are simply not of interest to a particular scientist. Active learning combines the flexibility and intuition of the human brain with the raw processing power of machine learning. By strategically choosing specific objects for expert labelling, it minimises the amount of data that scientists have to look through while maximising potential scientific return. Here we introduce ASTRONOMALY: a general anomaly detection framework with a novel active learning approach designed to provide personalised recommendations. ASTRONOMALY can operate on most types of astronomical data, including images, light curves and spectra. We use the Galaxy Zoo dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of ASTRONOMALY, as well as simulated data to thoroughly test our new active learning approach. We find that for both datasets, ASTRONOMALY roughly doubles the number of interesting anomalies found in the first 100 objects viewed by the user. ASTRONOMALY is easily extendable to include new feature extraction techniques, anomaly detection algorithms and even different active learning approaches.

Fast period searches using the Lomb-Scargle algorithm on Graphics Processing Units for large datasets and real-time applications;;Computing the periods of variable objects is well-known to be computationally expensive. Modern astronomical catalogs contain a significant number of observed objects. Therefore, even if the period ranges for particular classes of objects are well-constrained due to expected physical properties, periods must be derived for a tremendous number of objects. In this paper, we propose a GPU-accelerated Lomb-Scargle period finding algorithm that computes periods for single objects or for batches of objects as is necessary in many data processing pipelines. We demonstrate the performance of several optimizations, including comparing the use of shared and global memory GPU kernels and using multiple CUDA streams to copy periodogram data from the GPU to the host. Also, we quantify the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit floating point precision on two classes of GPUs, and show that the performance degradation of using 64-bit over 32-bit is greater on the CPU than a GPU designed for scientific computing. We find that the GPU algorithm achieves superior performance over the baseline parallel CPU implementation, achieving a speedup of up to 174.53 ×. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will carry out the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We perform an analysis that shows we can derive the rotation periods of batches of Solar System objects at LSST scale in near real-time, which will be employed in a future LSST event broker.

HiSS-Cube: A scalable framework for Hierarchical Semi-Sparse Cubes preserving uncertainties;;A wide variety of approaches are available for big data cube visualization and analysis. However, few exploit the power of array databases and none preserve the scientific uncertainties in measurements when constructing lower resolutions. In machine learning applications, we often need to rapidly search data for regions of interest and then focus on these areas, but without having to retrain the model every time we change the resolution. However, the reliable verification of these areas also requires details of the accuracy of the measured values. In this study, we developed a new software infrastructure called Hierarchical Semi-Sparse Cube (HiSS-Cube) based on Hierarchical Data Format version 5. HiSS-Cube enables visualization and machine learning using combined heterogeneous data and it was designed to be scalable for big data. HiSS-Cube allows data from multiple domains (imaging, spectral, and time-series data) to be combined and the construction of a multi-resolution semi-sparse data cube that preserves the uncertainties of scientific measurement at all resolutions. The functionality of HiSS-Cube was verified based on a subset of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 survey. We compared the times and volumes for visualizations and machine learning data exported to HiSS-Cube and the original format (FITS). Using these data, we demonstrated that HiSS-Cube is faster by several orders of magnitude. HiSS-Cube supports export to the VOTable format and it is compatible with common Virtual Observatory tools. The source code for our prototype HiSS-Cube is available from GitHub and the data are available from Zenodo.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&C....3600463N
A CHEOPS white dwarf transit search;;White dwarf spectroscopy shows that nearly half of white dwarf atmospheres contain metals that must have been accreted from planetary material that survived the red giant phases of stellar evolution. We can use metal pollution in white dwarf atmospheres as flags, signalling recent accretion, in order to prioritize an efficient sample of white dwarfs to search for transiting material. We present a search for planetesimals orbiting six nearby white dwarfs with the CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS). The targets are relatively faint for CHEOPS, 11 mag < G < 12.8 mag. We used aperture photometry data products from the CHEOPS mission as well as custom point-spread function photometry to search for periodic variations in flux due to transiting planetesimals. We detect no significant variations in flux that cannot be attributed to spacecraft systematics, despite reaching a photometric precision of < 2 ppt in 60 s exposures on each target. We simulate observations to show that the small survey is sensitive primarily to Moon-sized transiting objects with periods between 3 h < P < 10 h, with radii of R ≳ 1000 km.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...651L..12M
Galactic spiral structure revealed by Gaia EDR3;;Using the astrometry and integrated photometry from the Gaia Early Data Release 3, we map the density variations in the distribution of young upper main sequence (UMS) stars, open clusters, and classical Cepheids in the Galactic disc within several kiloparsecs of the Sun. We derive maps of relative over- and under-dense regions for UMS stars in the Galactic disc using both bivariate kernel density estimators and wavelet transformations. The resulting overdensity maps exhibit large-scale arches that extend in a clumpy but coherent way over the entire sampled volume, indicating the location of the spiral arm segments in the vicinity of the Sun. Peaks in the UMS overdensity are well matched by the distribution of young and intrinsically bright open clusters. By applying a wavelet transformation to a sample of classical Cepheids, we find that their overdensities possibly extend the spiral arm segments on a larger scale (≃10 kpc from the Sun). While the resulting map based on the UMS sample is generally consistent with previous models of the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm, the geometry of the arms in the III quadrant (galactic longitudes 180° < l < 270°) differs significantly from that suggested by many previous models. In particular, we find that our maps favour a larger pitch angle for the Perseus arm, and that the Local Arm extends into the III quadrant at least 4 kpc past the position of the Sun, giving it a total length of at least 8 kpc. 

The overdensity maps produced in this work are publicly available at <A href="https://github.com/epoggio/Spiral_arms_EDR3.git">https://github.com/epoggio/Spiral_arms_EDR3.git</A>.

Prospects for kilonova signals in the gravitational-wave era;;The binary neutron star merger gravitational-wave signal GW170817 was followed by three electromagnetic counterparts, including a kilonova arising from the radioactivity of freshly synthesized r-process elements in ejecta from the merger. Finding kilonovae after gravitational-wave triggers is crucial for (i) the search for further counterparts, such as the afterglow, (ii) probing the diversity of kilonovae and their dependence on the system's inclination angle, and (iii) building a sample for multi-messenger cosmology. During the third observing run of the gravitational-wave interferometer network, no kilonova counterpart was found. We aim to predict the expected population of detectable kilonova signals for the upcoming O4 and O5 observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA instruments. Using a simplified criterion for gravitational-wave detection and a simple GW170817-calibrated model for the kilonova peak magnitude, we determine the rate of kilonovae in reach of follow-up campaigns and their distributions in magnitude for various bands. We briefly consider the case of GW190425, the only binary neutron star merger confirmed since GW170817, and obtain constraints on its inclination angle from the non-detection of its kilonova, assuming the source was below the follow-up thresholds. We also show that non-gravitational-wave-triggered kilonovae can be a numerous class of sources in future surveys and briefly discuss associations with short bright gamma-ray bursts. We finally discuss the detection of the jetted outflow afterglow in addition to the kilonova.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...651A..83M
Type Ic supernovae from the (intermediate) Palomar Transient Factory;;Context. Type Ic supernovae represent the explosions of the most stripped massive stars, but their progenitors and explosion mechanisms remain unclear. Larger samples of observed supernovae can help characterize the population of these transients. 
 Aims: We present an analysis of 44 spectroscopically normal Type Ic supernovae, with focus on the light curves. The photometric data were obtained over 7 years with the Palomar Transient Factory and its continuation, the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory. This is the first homogeneous and large sample of SNe Ic from an untargeted survey, and we aim to estimate explosion parameters for the sample. 
 Methods: We present K-corrected Bgriz light curves of these SNe, obtained through photometry on template-subtracted images. We performed an analysis on the shape of the r-band light curves and confirmed the correlation between the rise parameter Δm<SUB>−10</SUB> and the decline parameter Δm<SUB>15</SUB>. Peak r-band absolute magnitudes have an average of −17.71 ± 0.85 mag. To derive the explosion epochs, we fit the r-band lightcurves to a template derived from a well-sampled light curve. We computed the bolometric light curves using r and g band data, g − r colors and bolometric corrections. Bolometric light curves and Fe II λ5169 velocities at peak were used to fit to the Arnett semianalytic model in order to estimate the ejecta mass M<SUB>ej</SUB>, the explosion energy E<SUB>K</SUB> and the mass of radioactive nickel M(<SUP>56</SUP>Ni) for each SN. 
 Results: Including 41 SNe, we find average values of ⟨M<SUB>ej</SUB>⟩ = 4.50 ± 0.79 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, ⟨E<SUB>K</SUB>⟩ = 1.79 ± 0.29 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg, and ⟨M<SUB><SUP>56</SUP>Ni</SUB>⟩ = 0.19 ± 0.03 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The explosion-parameter distributions are comparable to those available in the literature, but our large sample also includes some transients with narrow and very broad light curves leading to more extreme ejecta masses values. 

Light curves are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/">cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/651/A81">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/651/A81</A>;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...651A..81B
Removing Atmospheric Fringes from Zwicky Transient Facility i-band Images using Principal Component Analysis;;The Zwicky Transient Facility is a time-domain optical survey that has substantially increased our ability to observe and construct massive catalogs of astronomical objects by use of its 47 square degree camera that can observe in multiple filters. However the telescope's i-band filter suffers from significant atmospheric fringes that reduce photometric precision, especially for faint sources and in multi-epoch co-additions. Here we present a method for constructing models of these atmospheric fringes using Principal Component Analysis that can be used to identify and remove these artifacts from contaminated images. In addition, we present the Uniform Background Indicator as a quantitative measurement of the reduced correlated background noise and photometric error present after removing fringes. We conclude by evaluating the effect of our method on measuring faint sources through the injection and recovery of artificial stars in both single-image epochs and co-additions. Our method for constructing atmospheric fringe models and applying those models to produce cleaned images is available for public download in the open source Python package fringez (https://github.com/MichaelMedford/fringez).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASP..133f4503M
Spectroscopic and photometric observations of dwarf nova superoutbursts by the 3.8 m telescope Seimei and the Variable Star Network;;We present spectroscopic and photometric observations of 17 dwarf-nova superoutbursts obtained by KOOLS-IFU mounted on the 3.8 m telescope Seimei at the Okayama Observatory of Kyoto University and through the Variable Star Network collaboration (VSNET). Our spectroscopic observations for six outbursts were performed within 1 d of their optical peak. 11 objects (TCP J00590972+3438357, ASASSN-19ado, TCP J06073081-0101501, ZTF20aavnpug, ASASSN-19ady, MASTER OT J061642.05+435617.9, TCP J20034647+1335125, ASASSN-20kv, ASASSN-20kw, MASTER OT J213908.79+161240.2, and ASASSN-20mf) were previously unknown systems, and our observations enabled quick classification of their transient type. These results illustrate that the Seimei telescope has the capability to conduct quick follow-up observations of unknown transients. Our photometric observations yielded that 11 of the objects are WZ Sge-type dwarf novae and their candidates, and the other six are SU UMa-type dwarf novae and their candidates. The He II 4686 Å emission line was clearly detected among ASASSN-19ado, TCP J06073081-0101501 and MASTER OT J213908.79+161240.2, the association of which with a spiral arm structure in an accretion disk has been suggested in previous studies. Our result suggests that a higher-inclination system shows a stronger emission line of He II 4686 Å, as well as larger-amplitude early superhumps.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASJ...73..753T
Processing GOTO survey data with the Rubin Observatory LSST Science Pipelines II: Forced Photometry and lightcurves;;We have adapted the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Science Pipelines to process data from the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) prototype. In this paper, we describe how we used the LSST Science Pipelines to conduct forced photometry measurements on nightly GOTO data. By comparing the photometry measurements of sources taken on multiple nights, we find that the precision of our photometry is typically better than 20 mmag for sources brighter than 16 mag. We also compare our photometry measurements against colour-corrected Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System photometry and find that the two agree to within 10 mmag (1 $σ$ ) for bright (i.e., $∼ 14th mag$ ) sources to 200 mmag for faint (i.e., $∼ 18th mag$ ) sources. Additionally, we compare our results to those obtained by GOTO's own in-house pipeline, GOTOPHOTO, and obtain similar results. Based on repeatability measurements, we measure a $5σ$ L-band survey depth of between 19 and 20 magnitudes, depending on observing conditions. We assess, using repeated observations of non-varying standard Sloan Digital Sky Survey stars, the accuracy of our uncertainties, which we find are typically overestimated by roughly a factor of two for bright sources (i.e., $< 15th mag$ ), but slightly underestimated (by roughly a factor of 1.25) for fainter sources ( $> 17th mag$ ). Finally, we present lightcurves for a selection of variable sources and compare them to those obtained with the Zwicky Transient Factory and GAIA. Despite the LSST Software Pipelines still undergoing active development, our results show that they are already delivering robust forced photometry measurements from GOTO data.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASA...38...25M

Gamma-ray burst jets in supernovae;;We review the current observational status and theoretical interpretations for the class of broad lines type Ic supernovae. They are characterized by fast photospheric expansion and lack of H and He absorption. They have a larger than normal energy budget, suggesting that they are powered or, at least, augmented by a central engine, like a magnetar or an accreting black hole. There appears therefore to be a link between these supernovae and long-duration gamma-ray bursts. However, its nature has not been satisfactorily demystified.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NewAR..9201614C
A highly magnetized and rapidly rotating white dwarf as small as the Moon;;White dwarfs represent the last stage of evolution of stars with mass less than about eight times that of the Sun and, like other stars, are often found in binaries<SUP>1,2</SUP>. If the orbital period of the binary is short enough, energy losses from gravitational-wave radiation can shrink the orbit until the two white dwarfs come into contact and merge<SUP>3</SUP>. Depending on the component masses, the merger can lead to a supernova of type Ia or result in a massive white dwarf<SUP>4</SUP>. In the latter case, the white dwarf remnant is expected to be highly magnetized<SUP>5,6</SUP> because of the strong magnetic dynamo that should arise during the merger, and be rapidly spinning from the conservation of the orbital angular momentum<SUP>7</SUP>. Here we report observations of a white dwarf, ZTF J190132.9+145808.7, that exhibits these properties, but to an extreme: a rotation period of 6.94 minutes, a magnetic field ranging between 600 megagauss and 900 megagauss over its surface, and a stellar radius of 2140<SUB>−230</SUB><SUP>+160</SUP>? kilometres, only slightly larger than the radius of the Moon. Such a small radius implies that the star's mass is close to the maximum white dwarf mass, or Chandrasekhar mass. ZTF J190132.9+145808.7 is likely to be cooling through the Urca processes (neutrino emission from electron capture on sodium) because of the high densities reached in its core.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021Natur.595...39C
Infrared spectropolarimetric detection of intrinsic polarization from a core-collapse supernova;;Massive stars die an explosive death as a core-collapse supernova (CCSN). The exact physical processes that cause the collapsing star to rebound into an explosion are not well understood<SUP>1-3</SUP>, and the key to resolving this issue may lie in the measurement of the shape of CCSNe ejecta. Spectropolarimetry is the only way to perform this measurement for CCSNe outside the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. We present the infrared spectropolarimetric detection of a CCSN enabled by the new highly sensitive WIRC+Pol instrument at Palomar Observatory, which can observe CCSNe (magnitude M = −17 mag) out to 20 Mpc at ~0.1% polarimetric precision. Infrared spectropolarimetry is less affected than optical spectropolarimetry by dust scattering in the circumstellar and interstellar media, thereby providing a less biased probe of the intrinsic geometry of the supernova ejecta. SN 2018hna, a SN 1987A-like explosion, shows 2.0 ± 0.3% continuum polarization in the J band oriented at ~160° on sky 182 days after the explosion. Assuming a prolate geometry as in SN 1987A, we infer an ejecta axis ratio of <0.48 with the axis of symmetry pointing at a 70° position angle. The axis ratio is similar to that of SN 1987A, suggesting that the two CCSNe may share intrinsic geometry and inclination angles. Our data do not rule out oblate ejecta. We also observe one other CCSN and two thermonuclear supernovae in the J band. Supernova 2020oi, a stripped-envelope type Ic SN in Messier 100 has broadband p = 0.37 ± 0.09% at peak light, indicative of either a 10% asymmetry or host interstellar polarization. The type Ia SNe 2019ein and 2020ue have <0.33% and <1.08% polarization near peak light, indicative of asymmetries of less than 10% and 20%, respectively.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatAs...5..544T
Optimizing serendipitous detections of kilonovae: cadence and filter selection;;The rise of multimessenger astronomy has brought with it the need to exploit all available data streams and learn more about the astrophysical objects that fall within its breadth. One possible avenue is the search for serendipitous optical/near-infrared counterparts of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and gravitational-wave (GW) signals, known as kilonovae. With surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which observes the sky with a cadence of ~3 d, the existing counterpart locations are likely to be observed; however, due to the significant amount of sky to explore, it is difficult to search for these fast-evolving candidates. Thus, it is beneficial to optimize the survey cadence for realtime kilonova identification and enable further photometric and spectroscopic observations. We explore how the cadence of wide field-of-view surveys like ZTF can be improved to facilitate such identifications. We show that with improved observational choices, e.g. the adoption of three epochs per night on a ~ nightly basis, and the prioritization of redder photometric bands, detection efficiencies improve by about a factor of two relative to the nominal cadence. We also provide realistic hypothetical constraints on the kilonova rate as a form of comparison between strategies, assuming that no kilonovae are detected throughout the long-term execution of the respective observing plan. These results demonstrate how an optimal use of ZTF increases the likelihood of kilonova discovery independent of GWs or GRBs, thereby allowing for a sensitive search with less interruption of its nominal cadence through Target of Opportunity programs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.2822A
The first Hubble diagram and cosmological constraints using superluminous supernovae;;We present the first Hubble diagram of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) out to a redshift of two, together with constraints on the matter density, Ω<SUB>M</SUB>, and the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, w(≡p/ρ). We build a sample of 20 cosmologically useful SLSNe I based on light curve and spectroscopy quality cuts. We confirm the robustness of the peak-decline SLSN I standardization relation with a larger data set and improved fitting techniques than previous works. We then solve the SLSN model based on the above standardization via minimization of the χ<SUP>2</SUP> computed from a covariance matrix that includes statistical and systematic uncertainties. For a spatially flat Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model, we find $\Omega _{\rm M}=0.38^{+0.24}_{-0.19}$, with an rms of 0.27 mag for the residuals of the distance moduli. For a w<SUB>0</SUB>w<SUB>a</SUB>CDM cosmological model, the addition of SLSNe I to a 'baseline' measurement consisting of Planck temperature together with Type Ia supernovae, results in a small improvement in the constraints of w<SUB>0</SUB> and w<SUB>a</SUB> of 4 per cent. We present simulations of future surveys with 868 and 492 SLSNe I (depending on the configuration used) and show that such a sample can deliver cosmological constraints in a flat ΛCDM model with the same precision (considering only statistical uncertainties) as current surveys that use Type Ia supernovae, while providing a factor of 2-3 improvement in the precision of the constraints on the time variation of dark energy, w<SUB>0</SUB> and w<SUB>a</SUB>. This paper represents the proof of concept for superluminous supernova cosmology, and demonstrates they can provide an independent test of cosmology in the high-redshift (z > 1) universe.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.2535I
Towards a volumetric census of close white dwarf binaries - I. Reference samples;;Close white dwarf binaries play an important role across a range of astrophysics, including thermonuclear supernovae, the Galactic low-frequency gravitational wave signal, and the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. Progress in developing a detailed understanding of the complex, multithreaded evolutionary pathways of these systems is limited by the lack of statistically sound observational constraints on the relative fractions of various sub-populations and their physical properties. The available samples are small, heterogeneous, and subject to a multitude of observational biases. Our overarching goal is to establish a volume-limited sample of all types of white dwarf binaries that is representative of the underlying population as well as sufficiently large to serve as a benchmark for future binary population models. In this first paper, we provide an overview of the project, and assemble reference samples within a distance limit of 300 pc of known white dwarf binaries spanning the most common sub-classes: post-common envelope binaries containing a white dwarf plus a main-sequence star, cataclysmic variables, and double-degenerate binaries. We carefully vet the members of these "Gold" samples, which span most of the evolutionary parameter space of close white dwarf binary evolution. We also explore the differences between magnitude and volume limited close white dwarf binary samples, and discuss how these systems evolve in their observational properties across the Gaia Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.2420I
A cool and inflated progenitor candidate for the Type Ib supernova 2019yvr at 2.6 yr before explosion;;We present Hubble Space Telescope imaging of a pre-explosion counterpart to SN 2019yvr obtained 2.6 yr before its explosion as a type Ib supernova (SN Ib). Aligning to a post-explosion Gemini-S/GSAOI image, we demonstrate that there is a single source consistent with being the SN 2019yvr progenitor system, the second SN Ib progenitor candidate after iPTF13bvn. We also analysed pre-explosion Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) imaging, but we do not detect any counterparts at the SN location. SN 2019yvr was highly reddened, and comparing its spectra and photometry to those of other, less extinguished SNe Ib we derive $E(B-V)=0.51\substack{+0.27\\ -0.16}$ mag for SN 2019yvr. Correcting photometry of the pre-explosion source for dust reddening, we determine that this source is consistent with a log (L/L<SUB>⊙</SUB>) = 5.3 ± 0.2 and $T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 6800\substack{+400\\ -200}$ K star. This relatively cool photospheric temperature implies a radius of 320$\substack{+30\\ -50}~\mathrm{ R}_{\odot}$, much larger than expectations for SN Ib progenitor stars with trace amounts of hydrogen but in agreement with previously identified SN IIb progenitor systems. The photometry of the system is also consistent with binary star models that undergo common envelope evolution, leading to a primary star hydrogen envelope mass that is mostly depleted but still seemingly in conflict with the SN Ib classification of SN 2019yvr. SN 2019yvr had signatures of strong circumstellar interaction in late-time (>150 d) spectra and imaging, and so we consider eruptive mass-loss and common envelope evolution scenarios that explain the SN Ib spectroscopic class, pre-explosion counterpart, and dense circumstellar material. We also hypothesize that the apparent inflation could be caused by a quasi-photosphere formed in an extended, low-density envelope, or circumstellar matter around the primary star.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.2073K
Detectability of kilonovae in optical surveys: post-mortem examination of the LVC O3 run follow-up;;The detection of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and the associated electromagnetic (EM) counterpart, the 'kilonova' (kN) AT2017gfo, opened a new era in multimessenger astronomy. However, despite many efforts, it has been proven very difficult to find additional kNe, even though LIGO/Virgo has reported at least one BNS event during their latest run, O3. The focus of this work is the exploration of the sensitivity of the adopted optical surveys searching for kNe during O3. We propose ways to optimize the choices of filters and survey depth to boost the detection efficiency for these faint and fast-evolving transients in the future. In particular, we use kN models to explore the dependence on ejecta mass, geometry, viewing angle, wavelength coverage, and source distance. We find that the kN detection efficiency has a strong viewing-angle dependence, especially for filters blueward of i-band. This loss of sensitivity can be mitigated by early, deep, observations. Efficient gri counterpart searches for kNe at ~200 Mpc would require reaching a limiting magnitude m<SUB>lim</SUB> = 23 mag, to ensure good sensitivity over a wide range of the model phase-space. We conclude that kN searches during O3 were generally too shallow to detect BNS optical counterparts, even under optimistic assumptions.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.1294S
Accretion disc cooling and narrow absorption lines in the tidal disruption event AT 2019dsg;;We present the results of a large multiwavelength follow-up campaign of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT 2019dsg, focusing on low to high resolution optical spectroscopy, X-ray, and radio observations. The galaxy hosts a super massive black hole of mass $\rm (5.4\pm 3.2)\times 10^6\, M_\odot$ and careful analysis finds no evidence for the presence of an active galactic nucleus, instead the TDE host galaxy shows narrow optical emission lines that likely arise from star formation activity. The transient is luminous in the X-rays, radio, UV, and optical. The X-ray emission becomes undetected after ~100 d, and the radio luminosity density starts to decay at frequencies above 5.4 GHz by ~160 d. Optical emission line signatures of the TDE are present up to ~200 d after the light-curve peak. The medium to high resolution spectra show traces of absorption lines that we propose originate in the self-gravitating debris streams. At late times, after ~200 d, narrow Fe lines appear in the spectra. The TDE was previously classified as N-strong, but after careful subtraction of the host galaxy's stellar contribution, we find no evidence for these N lines in the TDE spectrum, even though O Bowen lines are detected. The observed properties of the X-ray emission are fully consistent with the detection of the inner regions of a cooling accretion disc. The optical and radio properties are consistent with this central engine seen at a low inclination (i.e. seen from the poles).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504..792C
On the AGN nature of broad balmer emission in four low-redshift metal-poor galaxies;;We report on continued, ~15-yr long, broad Balmer emission lines in three metal-poor dwarf emission-line galaxies selected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy. The persistent luminosity of the broad Balmer emission indicates the galaxies are active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with virial black hole masses of ~10<SUP>6.7</SUP>-10<SUP>7.0</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The lack of observed hard X-ray emission and the possibility that the Balmer emission could be due to a long-lived stellar transient motivated additional follow-up spectroscopy. We also identify a previously unreported blueshifted narrow absorption line in the broad H α feature in one of the AGNs, indicating an AGN-driven outflow with hydrogen column densities of order 10<SUP>17</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. We also extract light curves from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey and the Zwicky Transient Facility. We detect probable AGN-like variability in three galaxies, further supporting the AGN scenario. This also suggests the AGNs are not strongly obscured. This sample of galaxies are among the most metal-poor that host an AGN (Z = 0.05-0.16 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>). We speculate they may be analogues to seed black holes which formed in unevolved galaxies at high redshift. Given the rarity of metal-poor AGNs and small sample size available, we investigate prospects for their identification in future spectroscopic and photometric surveys.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504..543B
Dipper-like variability of the Gaia alerted young star V555 Ori;;V555 Ori is a T Tauri star, whose 1.5 mag brightening was published as a Gaia science alert in 2017. We carried out optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometric, and optical spectroscopic observations to understand the light variations. The light curves show that V555 Ori was faint before 2017, entered a high state for about a year, and returned to the faint state by mid-2018. In addition to the long-term flux evolution, quasi-periodic brightness oscillations were also evident, with a period of about 5 d. At optical wavelengths both the long-term and short-term variations exhibited colourless changes, while in the NIR they were consistent with changing extinction. We explain the brightness variations as the consequence of changing extinction. The object has a low accretion rate whose variation in itself would not be enough to reproduce the optical flux changes. This behaviour makes V555 Ori similar to the pre-main sequence star AA Tau, where the light changes are interpreted as periodic eclipses of the star by a rotating inner disc warp. The brightness maximum of V555 Ori was a moderately obscured (A<SUB>V</SUB> = 2.3 mag) state, while the extinction in the low state was A<SUB>V</SUB> = 6.4 mag. We found that while the Gaia alert hinted at an accretion burst, V555 Ori is a standard dipper, similar to the prototype AA Tau. However, unlike in AA Tau, the periodic behaviour was also detectable in the faint phase, implying that the inner disc warp remained stable in both the high and low states of the system.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504..185N
No velocity-kicks are required to explain large-distance offsets of Ca-rich supernovae and short-GRBs;;Environments of supernovae (SNe) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) link their progenitors to the underlying stellar population, providing critical clues for their origins. However, various transients including Ca-rich SNe and short-GRBs, appear to be located at remote locations, far from the stellar population of their host galaxy, challenging our understanding of their origin and/or physical evolution. These findings instigated models suggesting that either large velocity-kicks were imparted to the transient progenitors, allowing them to propagate to large distances and attain their remote locations; or that they formed in dense globular-clusters residing in the haloes. Here we show that instead, large spatial-offsets of such transients are naturally explained by observations of highly extended stellar populations in (mostly early-type) galaxy haloes, typically missed since they can only be identified through ultra-deep/stacked images. Consequently, no large velocity kicks, nor halo globular-cluster environments are required in order to explain the origin of these transients. These findings support thermonuclear explosions on white-dwarfs, for the origins of Ca-rich SNe progenitors, and the existence of small (or zero) kick-velocities given to short-GRB progenitors. Furthermore, since stacked/ultra-deep imaging show that early-type galaxies are more extended than late-type galaxies, studies of transients' offset-distribution (e.g. type Ia SNe or FRBs) should account for host galaxy-type. Since early-type galaxies contain older stellar populations, transient arising from older stellar populations would have larger fractions of early-type hosts, and consequently larger fractions of large-offset transients. In agreement with our results for short-GRBs and Ca-rich SNe showing different offset distributions in early versus late-type galaxies.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.5997P
Thermonuclear explosion of a massive hybrid HeCO white dwarf triggered by a He detonation on a companion;;Normal type Ia supernovae (SNe) are thought to arise from the thermonuclear explosion of massive (>0.8 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (WDs), although the exact mechanism is debated. In some models, helium accretion on to a carbon-oxygen (CO) WD from a companion was suggested to dynamically trigger a detonation of the accreted helium shell. The helium detonation then produces a shock that after converging on itself close to the core of the CO WD, triggers a secondary carbon detonation, and gives rise to an energetic explosion. However, most studies of such scenarios have been done in one or two dimensions, and/or did not consider self-consistent models for the accretion and the He donor. Here, we make use of detailed 3D simulation to study the interaction of a He-rich hybrid $0.69\, \mathrm{M_\odot }$ HeCO WD with a more massive $0.8\, \mathrm{M_\odot }$ CO WD. We find that accretion from the hybrid WD on to the CO WD gives rise to a helium detonation. However, the helium detonation does not trigger a carbon detonation in the CO WD. Instead, the helium detonation burns through the accretion stream to also burn the helium shell of the donor hybrid HeCO WD. The detonation of its massive helium shell then compresses its CO core, and triggers its detonation and full destruction. The explosion gives rise to a faint, likely highly reddened transient, potentially observable by the Vera Rubin survey, and the high-velocity ( $\sim \! 1000\, \mathrm{km s^{-1}}$ ) ejection of the heated surviving CO WD companion. Pending on uncertainties in stellar evolution, we estimate the rate of such transient to be up to $\sim \! 10{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the rate of type Ia SNe.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.4734P
IceCube-Gen2: the window to the extreme Universe;;The observation of electromagnetic radiation from radio to γ-ray wavelengths has provided a wealth of information about the Universe. However, at PeV (10<SUP>15</SUP> eV) energies and above, most of the Universe is impenetrable to photons. New messengers, namely cosmic neutrinos, are needed to explore the most extreme environments of the Universe where black holes, neutron stars, and stellar explosions transform gravitational energy into non-thermal cosmic rays. These energetic particles have millions of times higher energies than those produced in the most powerful particle accelerators on Earth. As neutrinos can escape from regions otherwise opaque to radiation, they allow an unique view deep into exploding stars and the vicinity of the event horizons of black holes. The discovery of cosmic neutrinos with IceCube has opened this new window on the Universe. IceCube has been successful in finding first evidence for cosmic particle acceleration in the jet of an active galactic nucleus. Yet, ultimately, its sensitivity is too limited to detect even the brightest neutrino sources with high significance, or to detect populations of less luminous sources. In this white paper, we present an overview of a next-generation instrument, IceCube-Gen2, which will sharpen our understanding of the processes and environments that govern the Universe at the highest energies. IceCube-Gen2 is designed to:;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JPhG...48f0501A
MeerCRAB: MeerLICHT classification of real and bogus transients using deep learning;;Astronomers require efficient automated detection and classification pipelines when conducting large-scale surveys of the (optical) sky for variable and transient sources. Such pipelines are fundamentally important, as they permit rapid follow-up and analysis of those detections most likely to be of scientific value. We therefore present a deep learning pipeline based on the convolutional neural network architecture called MeerCRAB. It is designed to filter out the so called "bogus" detections from true astrophysical sources in the transient detection pipeline of the MeerLICHT telescope. Optical candidates are described using a variety of 2D images and numerical features extracted from those images. The relationship between the input images and the target classes is unclear, since the ground truth is poorly defined and often the subject of debate. This makes it difficult to determine which source of information should be used to train a classification algorithm. We therefore used two methods for labelling our data (i) thresholding and (ii) latent class model approaches. We deployed variants of MeerCRAB that employed different network architectures trained using different combinations of input images and training set choices, based on classification labels provided by volunteers. The deepest network worked best with an accuracy of 99.5% and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value of 0.989. The best model was integrated to the MeerLICHT transient vetting pipeline, enabling the accurate and efficient classification of detected transients that allows researchers to select the most promising candidates for their research goals.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ExA...tmp...61H
MASTER OT J172758.09+380021.5: a peculiar ER UMa-type dwarf nova, probably a missed nova in the recent past;;A CCD photometry of the dwarf nova MASTER OT J172758.09+380021.5 was carried out in 2019 during 134 nights. Observations covered three superoutbursts, five normal outbursts and quiescence between them. The available ASASSN and ZTF data for 2014 -- 2020 were also examined. Spectral observations were done in 2020 when the object was in quiescence. Spectra and photometry revealed that the star is an H-rich active ER UMa-type dwarf nova with a highly variable supercycle (time interval between two successive superoutbursts) of ∼ 50 -- 100 d that implies a high and variable mass-transfer rate. MASTER OT J172758.09+380021.5 demonstrated peculiar behaviour: short-lasted superoutbursts (a week); a slow superoutburst decline and cases of rebrightenings; low frequency (from none to a few) of the normal outbursts during the supercycle. In 2019 a mean period of positive superhumps was found to be 0.05829 d during the superoutbursts. Late superhumps with a mean period of 0.057915 d which lasted about ∼ 20 d after the end of superoutburst and were replaced by an orbital period of 0.057026 d or its orbital-negative superhump beat period were detected. An absence of eclipse in the orbital light curve and its moderate amplitude are consistent with the orbital inclination of about 40\degr found from spectroscopy. The blue peaks of the V-Ic and B-Rc colour indices of superhumps during the superoutburst coincided with minima of the light curves, while B-Rc of the late superhumps coincided with a rising branch of the light curves. We found that a low mass ratio q = 0.08 could explain most of the peculiarities of MASTER OT J172758.09+380021.5. The mass-transfer rate should be accordingly higher than what is expected from gravitational radiation only, this assumes the object is in a post-nova state and underwent a nova eruption relatively recently -- hundreds of years ago. This object would provide probably the first observational evidence that a nova eruption can occur even in CVs near the period minimum.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021CoSka..51..138P
New SU UMa-type star ZTF18abdlzhd in the Zwicky Transient Facility data;;We carried out a search for unknown dwarf novae in a public data release of the Zwicky Transient Facility survey and suspected that the object ZTF18abdlzhd is a SU UMa-type star. Performed multicolor CCD observations permit us to follow its fading from an outburst in August and an entire superoutburst in October 2020. The duration of the superoutburst is 13 days. We detected superhumps with period P = 0.06918(3) d that are characteristic of UGSU type stars.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021CoSka..51..132A
SPICY: The Spitzer/IRAC Candidate YSO Catalog for the Inner Galactic Midplane;;We present ∼120,000 Spitzer/IRAC candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) based on surveys of the Galactic midplane between ℓ ∼ 255° and 110°, including the GLIMPSE I, II, and 3D, Vela-Carina, Cygnus X, and SMOG surveys (613 square degrees), augmented by near-infrared catalogs. We employed a classification scheme that uses the flexibility of a tailored statistical learning method and curated YSO data sets to take full advantage of Spitzer's spatial resolution and sensitivity in the mid-infrared ∼3-9 μm range. Multiwavelength color/magnitude distributions provide intuition about how the classifier separates YSOs from other red IRAC sources and validate that the sample is consistent with expectations for disk/envelope-bearing pre-main-sequence stars. We also identify areas of IRAC color space associated with objects with strong silicate absorption or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission. Spatial distributions and variability properties help corroborate the youthful nature of our sample. Most of the candidates are in regions with mid-IR nebulosity, associated with star-forming clouds, but others appear distributed in the field. Using Gaia DR2 distance estimates, we find groups of YSO candidates associated with the Local Arm, the Sagittarius-Carina Arm, and the Scutum-Centaurus Arm. Candidate YSOs visible to the Zwicky Transient Facility tend to exhibit higher variability amplitudes than randomly selected field stars of the same magnitude, with many high-amplitude variables having light-curve morphologies characteristic of YSOs. Given that no current or planned instruments will significantly exceed IRAC's spatial resolution while possessing its wide-area mapping capabilities, Spitzer-based catalogs such as ours will remain the main resources for mid-infrared YSOs in the Galactic midplane for the near future.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..254...33K
Do LIGO/Virgo Black Hole Mergers Produce AGN Flares? The Case of GW190521 and Prospects for Reaching a Confident Association;;The recent report of an association of the gravitational-wave (GW) binary black hole (BBH) merger GW190521 with a flare in the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) J124942.3 344929 has generated tremendous excitement. However, GW190521 has one of the largest localization volumes among all of the GW events detected so far. The 90 localization volume likely contains 7400 unobscured AGNs brighter than g 20.5 AB mag, and it results in a 70 probability of chance coincidence for an AGN flare consistent with the GW event. We present a Bayesian formalism to estimate the confidence of an AGN association by analyzing a population of BBH events with dedicated follow-up observations. Depending on the fraction of BBHs arising from AGNs, counterpart searches of ${ \mathcal O }(1)-{ \mathcal O }(100)$ GW events are needed to establish a confident association, and more than an order of magnitude more for searches without follow-up (i.e., using only the locations of AGN and GW events). Follow-up campaigns of the top 5 (based on volume localization and binary mass) of BBH events with total rest-frame mass 50 M are expected to establish a confident association during the next LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing run (O4), as long as the true value of the fraction of BBHs giving rise to AGN flares is >0.1. Our formalism allows us to jointly infer cosmological parameters from a sample of BBH events that include chance coincidence flares. Until the confidence of AGN associations is established, the probability of chance coincidence must be taken into account to avoid biasing astrophysical and cosmological constraints.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...914L..34P
Thermonuclear Explosions and Accretion-induced Collapses of White Dwarfs in Active Galactic Nucleus Accretion Disks;;White dwarfs (WDs) embedded in the gaseous disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can rapidly accrete materials from these disks and grow in mass to reach, or even exceed, the Chandrasekhar limit. Binary WD (BWD) mergers are also believed to occur in AGN accretion disks. We study observational signatures from these events. We suggest that mass-accreting WDs and BWD mergers in AGN disks can lead to thermonuclear explosions that drive an ejecta shock breakout from the disk surface and power a slow-rising, relatively dim Type Ia supernova (SN). It is possible that such SNe Ia may be outshone by the emission of the AGN disk around a supermassive black hole (BH) with a mass of M<SUB>SMBH</SUB> ≳ 10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. In addition, accretion-induced collapses (AICs) of WDs in AGN disks may sometimes occur, which may form highly magnetized millisecond neutron stars (NSs). The subsequent spindown process of this nascent magnetar can deposit its rotational energy into the disk materials, resulting in a magnetar-driven shock breakout and a luminous magnetar-powered transient. We show that such an AIC event could power a rapidly evolving and luminous transient for a magnetic field of B ∼ 10<SUP>15</SUP> G. The rising time and peak luminosity of the transient, powered by a magnetar with B ∼ 10<SUP>14</SUP> G, are predicted to have similar properties to those of superluminous SNe. AIC events taking place in the inner parts of disks around relatively less massive supermassive BHs (M<SUB>SMBH</SUB> ≲ 10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) are more likely to power transients that are much brighter than the AGN disk emission, and hence easily identified.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...914L..19Z
The Gaia-ASAS-SN Classical Cepheid Sample. I. Sample Selection;;We present a well-defined and characterized all-sky sample of classical Cepheids in the Milky Way, obtained by combining two time-domain all-sky surveys: Gaia DR2 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018) and All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN; Shappee et al. 2014). We first use parallax and variability information from Gaia to select ~30,000 bright (G < 17) Cepheid candidates with M<SUB>K</SUB> < - 1. We then analyze their ASAS-SN V-band light curves, determining periods and classifying the light curves using their Fourier parameters. This results in ~1900 likely Galactic Cepheids, which we estimate to be ≳90% complete and pure within our adopted selection criteria. This is the largest all-sky sample of Milky Way Cepheids that has such a well-characterized selection function, needed for population modeling and for systematic spectroscopic follow-up foreseen with Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V. About 130 of these potential Cepheids have not been documented in the literature even as possible candidates.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...914..127I
Light Curves of Partial Tidal Disruption Events;;Tidal disruption events (TDEs) can uncover the quiescent black holes (BHs) at the center of galaxies and also offer a promising method to study them. In a partial TDE (PTDE), the BH's tidal force cannot fully disrupt the star, so the stellar core survives and only a varied portion of the stellar mass is bound to the BH and feeds it. We calculate the event rate of PTDEs and full TDEs (FTDEs). In general, the event rate of PTDEs is higher than that of FTDEs, especially for the larger BHs, and the detection rate of PTDEs is approximately dozens per year, as observed by the Zwicky Transient Factory. During the circularization process of the debris stream in PTDEs, no outflow can be launched due to the efficient radiative diffusion. The circularized debris ring then experiences viscous evolution and forms an accretion disk. We calculate the light curves of PTDEs contributed by these two processes, along with their radiation temperature evolution. The light curves have double peaks and peak in the UV spectra. Without obscuration or reprocessing of the radiation by an outflow, PTDEs provide a clean environment to study the circularization and transient disk formation in TDEs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...914...69C
SN 2019yvq Does Not Conform to SN Ia Explosion Models;;We present new photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2019yvq, a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) exhibiting several peculiar properties including an excess of UV/optical flux within days of explosion, a high Si II velocity, and a low peak luminosity. Photometry near the time of first light places new constraints on the rapid rise of the UV/optical flux excess. A near-infrared spectrum at +173 days after maximum light places strict limits on the presence of H or He emission, effectively excluding the presence of a nearby nondegenerate star at the time of explosion. New optical spectra, acquired at +128 and +150 days after maximum light, confirm the presence of [Ca II] λ7300 and persistent Ca II NIR triplet emission as SN 2019yvq transitions into the nebular phase. The lack of [O I] $\lambda 6300$ emission disfavors the violent merger of two C/O white dwarfs (WDs) but the merger of a C/O WD with a He WD cannot be excluded. We compare our findings with several models in the literature postulated to explain the early flux excess including double-detonation explosions, <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mixing into the outer ejecta during ignition, and interaction with H- and He-deficient circumstellar material. Each model may be able to explain both the early flux excess and the nebular [Ca II] emission, but none of the models can reconcile the high photospheric velocities with the low peak luminosity without introducing new discrepancies.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...914...50T
The Luminous and Double-peaked Type Ic Supernova 2019stc: Evidence for Multiple Energy Sources;;We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2019stc (=ZTF19acbonaa), an unusual Type Ic supernova (SN Ic) at a redshift of z = 0.117. SN 2019stc exhibits a broad double-peaked light curve, with the first peak having an absolute magnitude of M<SUB>r</SUB> = -20.0 mag, and the second peak, about 80 rest-frame days later, M<SUB>r</SUB> = -19.2 mag. The total radiated energy is large, E<SUB>rad</SUB> ≈ 2.5 × 10<SUP>50</SUP> erg. Despite its large luminosity, approaching those of Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), SN 2019stc exhibits a typical SN Ic spectrum, bridging the gap between SLSNe and SNe Ic. The spectra indicate the presence of Fe-peak elements, but modeling of the first light-curve peak with radioactive heating alone leads to an unusually high nickel mass fraction of f<SUB>Ni</SUB> ≈ 0.31 (M<SUB>Ni</SUB> ≈ 3.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). Instead, if we model the first peak with a combined magnetar spin-down and radioactive heating model we find a better match with M<SUB>ej</SUB> ≈ 4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, a magnetar spin period of P<SUB>spin</SUB> ≈ 7.2 ms, and magnetic field of B ≈ 10<SUP>14</SUP> G, and f<SUB>Ni</SUB> ≲ 0.2 (consistent with SNe Ic). The prominent second peak cannot be naturally accommodated with radioactive heating or magnetar spin-down, but instead can be explained as circumstellar interaction with ≈0.7 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of hydrogen-free material located ≈400 au from the progenitor. Accounting for the ejecta mass, circumstellar shell mass, and remnant neutron star mass, we infer a CO core mass prior to explosion of ≈6.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The host galaxy has a metallicity of ≈0.26 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>, low for SNe Ic but consistent with SLSNe. Overall, we find that SN 2019stc is a transition object between normal SNe Ic and SLSNe.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...913..143G
Minimum Orbital Periods of H-rich Bodies;;In this work we derive the minimum allowed orbital periods of H-rich bodies ranging in mass from Saturn's mass to 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, emphasizing gas giants and brown dwarfs (BDs) over the range 0.0003-0.074 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Analytic fitting formulae for ${P}_{\min }$ as a function of the mass of the body and as a function of the mean density are presented. We assume that the density of the host star is sufficiently high so as not to limit the minimum period. In many instances this implies that the host star is a white dwarf. This work is aimed, in part, toward distinguishing BDs from planets that are found transiting the host white dwarf without recourse to near-infrared or radial velocity measurements. In particular, orbital periods of ≲100 minutes are very likely to be BDs. The overall minimum period over this entire mass range is ≃37 minutes.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...913..118R
AGNs on the Move: A Search for Off-nuclear AGNs from Recoiling Supermassive Black Holes and Ongoing Galaxy Mergers with the Zwicky Transient Facility;;A supermassive black hole (SMBH) ejected from the potential well of its host galaxy via gravitational wave recoil carries important information about the mass ratio and spin alignment of the pre-merger SMBH binary. Such a recoiling SMBH may be detectable as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) broad-line region offset by up to 10 kpc from a disturbed host galaxy. We describe a novel methodology using forward modeling with The Tractor to search for such offset AGNs in a sample of 5493 optically variable AGNs detected with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We present the discovery of nine AGNs that may be spatially offset from their host galaxies and are candidates for recoiling SMBHs. Five of these offset AGNs exhibit double-peaked broad Balmer lines, which may have arisen from unobscured accretion disk emission, and four show radio emission indicative of a relativistic jet. The fraction of double-peaked emitters in our spatially offset AGN sample is significantly larger than the 16% double-peaked emitter fraction observed for ZTF AGNs overall. In our sample of variable AGNs we also identified 52 merging galaxies, including a new spectroscopically confirmed dual AGN. Finally, we detected the dramatic rebrightening of SDSS 1133, a previously discovered variable object and recoiling SMBH candidate, in ZTF. The flare was accompanied by the reemergence of strong P Cygni line features, indicating that SDSS 1133 may be an outbursting luminous blue variable star.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...913..102W
The ZTF Source Classification Project. I. Methods and Infrastructure;;The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) has been observing the entire northern sky since the start of 2018 down to a magnitude of 20.5 (5σ for 30 s exposure) in the g, r, and i filters. Over the course of two years, ZTF has obtained light curves of more than a billion sources, each with 50-1000 epochs per light curve in g and r, and fewer in i. To be able to use the information contained in the light curves of variable sources for new scientific discoveries, an efficient and flexible framework is needed to classify them. In this paper, we introduce the methods and infrastructure that will be used to classify all ZTF light curves. Our approach aims to be flexible and modular and allows the use of a dynamical classification scheme and labels, continuously evolving training sets, and the use of different machine-learning classifier types and architectures. With this setup, we are able to continuously update and improve the classification of ZTF light curves as new data become available, training samples are updated, and new classes need to be incorporated.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....161..267V
SN 2018ijp: the explosion of a stripped-envelope star within a dense H-rich shell?;;In this paper, we discuss the outcomes of the follow-up campaign of SN 2018ijp, discovered as part of the Zwicky Transient Facility survey for optical transients. Its first spectrum shows similarities to broad-lined Type Ic supernovae around maximum light, whereas later spectra display strong signatures of interaction between rapidly expanding ejecta and a dense H-rich circumstellar medium, coinciding with a second peak in the photometric evolution of the transient. This evolution, along with the results of modeling of the first light-curve peak, suggests a scenario where a stripped star exploded within a dense circumstellar medium. The two main phases in the evolution of the transient could be interpreted as a first phase dominated by radioactive decays, and a later interaction-dominated phase where the ejecta collide with a pre-existing shell. We therefore discuss SN 2018jp within the context of a massive star depleted of its outer layers exploding within a dense H-rich circumstellar medium.

A search for distant, pulsating red giants in the southern halo;;To investigate the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) population in the Galactic halo, we search for pulsating AGB stars at a heliocentric distance D > 50 kpc. Our research is based on the Catalina Southern Survey (CSS) catalogue of variables, comprising 1286 long-period variables (LPVs) with δ < −20°. We first focus on the 77 stars in the cap |b| > 30° for which spectral M-type or C-type classification can be derived from Hamburg-ESO objective prism spectra. Most of these are oxygen-rich (M-type) and very few are carbon rich. The periods are in the range 100-500 days, and CSS amplitudes are up to 3 mag. In this small sample, no halo AGB star is fainter than K<SUB>s</SUB><SUB>0</SUB> = 12.5. This may be due to the scarcity of AGBs in the outer halo, or insufficient instrumental depth. Leaving aside spectral information, we then searched for even fainter pulsators (K<SUB>s</SUB> > 12.5) in the entire CSS catalogue. Gaia astrometry makes it possible to identify some contaminants. Our final result is the identification of ten candidate distant LPVs. If these ten stars obey the fundamental mode K-band period-luminosity relation used for Miras and small-amplitude Miras, their distances are between 50 and 120 kpc from the Sun. In a diagram showing distance versus Gaia tangential velocity, these ten stars have positions consistent with that of other objects in the halo, such as globular clusters and dwarf galaxies. We detect some underluminous AGBs that deserve further study. Finally, the halo LPVs ressemble the slow redder variable of globular clusters when colour and periods are compared.

Spectral separation of the stochastic gravitational-wave background for LISA: Observing both cosmological and astrophysical backgrounds;;With the goal of observing a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) with LISA, the spectral separability of the cosmological and astrophysical backgrounds is important to estimate. We attempt to determine the level with which a cosmological background can be observed given the predicted astrophysical background level. We predict detectable limits for the future LISA measurement of the SGWB. Adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used to produce estimates with the simulated data from the LISA Data Challenge. We also calculate the Cramer-Rao lower bound on the variance of the SGWB parameter estimates based on the inverse Fisher information using the Whittle likelihood. The estimation of the parameters is done with the three LISA channels A , E , and T . We simultaneously estimate the noise using a LISA noise model. Assuming the expected astrophysical background around Ω<SUB>GW ,astro</SUB>(25 Hz )=0.355 →35.5 ×10<SUP>-9</SUP> , a cosmological SGWB normalized energy density of around Ω<SUB>GW ,Cosmo</SUB>≈1 ×10<SUP>-12</SUP> to 1 ×10<SUP>-13</SUP> can be detected by LISA after 4 years of observation.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PhRvD.103j3529B
J-GEM optical and near-infrared follow-up of gravitational wave events during LIGO's and Virgo's third observing run;;The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration (LVC) sent out 56 gravitational-wave (GW) notices during the third observing run (O3). The Japanese Collaboration for Gravitational wave ElectroMagnetic follow-up (J-GEM) performed optical and near-infrared observations to identify and observe an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. We constructed a web-based system that enabled us to obtain and share information on candidate host galaxies for the counterpart, and the status of our observations. Candidate host galaxies were selected from the GLADE catalog with a weight based on the 3D GW localization map provided by LVC. We conducted galaxy-targeted and wide-field blind surveys, real-time data analysis, and visual inspection of observed galaxies. We performed galaxy-targeted follow-ups to 23 GW events during O3, and the maximum probability covered by our observations reached 9.8$\%$. Among these, we successfully started observations for 10 GW events within 0.5 days after the detection. This result demonstrates that our follow-up observation has the potential to constrain EM radiation models for a merger of binary neutron stars at a distance of up to $\sim$100 Mpc with a probability area of $\leq$ 500 deg$^2$.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PTEP.2021eA104S
A Morphological Classification Model to Identify Unresolved PanSTARRS1 Sources. II. Update to the PS1 Point Source Catalog;;We present an update to the PanSTARRS-1 Point Source Catalog (PS1 PSC), which provides morphological classifications of PS1 sources. The original PS1 PSC adopted stringent detection criteria that excluded hundreds of millions of PS1 sources from the PSC. Here, we adapt the supervised machine learning methods used to create the PS1 PSC and apply them to different photometric measurements that are more widely available, allowing us to add ∼144 million new classifications while expanding the the total number of sources in PS1 PSC by ∼10%. We find that the new methodology, which utilizes PS1 forced photometry, performs ∼6%-8% worse than the original method. This slight degradation in performance is offset by the overall increase in the size of the catalog. The PS1 PSC is used by time-domain surveys to filter transient alert streams by removing candidates coincident with point sources that are likely to be Galactic in origin. The addition of ∼144 million new classifications to the PS1 PSC will improve the efficiency with which transients are discovered.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASP..133e4502M
SkyMapper optical follow-up of gravitational wave triggers: Alert science data pipeline and LIGO/Virgo O3 run;;We present an overview of the SkyMapper optical follow-up programme for gravitational-wave event triggers from the LIGO/Virgo observatories, which aims at identifying early GW170817-like kilonovae out to $∼200 Mpc$ distance. We describe our robotic facility for rapid transient follow-up, which can target most of the sky at $δ<+10\deg $ to a depth of $i_AB≈ 20 mag$ . We have implemented a new software pipeline to receive LIGO/Virgo alerts, schedule observations and examine the incoming real-time data stream for transient candidates. We adopt a real-bogus classifier using ensemble-based machine learning techniques, attaining high completeness ( $∼98%$ ) and purity ( $∼91%$ ) over our whole magnitude range. Applying further filtering to remove common image artefacts and known sources of transients, such as asteroids and variable stars, reduces the number of candidates by a factor of more than 10. We demonstrate the system performance with data obtained for GW190425, a binary neutron star merger detected during the LIGO/Virgo O3 observing campaign. In time for the LIGO/Virgo O4 run, we will have deeper reference images allowing transient detection to $i_AB≈ 21 mag$.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASA...38...24C
Optical and electrical correlation effects in ZnO nanostructures: Role of pulsed laser annealing;;This paper reports the preparation and characterization of some high quality polycrystalline ZnO nanofilms (ZNFs) deposited on silicon (Si) substrates via sol gel allied spin coating process. The properties of such deposited ZNFs were modified by Nd:YAG pulsed laser annealing at varied wavelengths. The impact of pulse laser wavelengths on the structural, morphological, optical and electrical characteristics of these nanofilms was evaluated. Annealing at third harmonic generation wavelength of 355 nm was found to produce ZNFs with much better polycrystallinity and strong lattice orientation than the one annealed at the fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm. Furthermore, annealing at the second harmonic generation wavelength of 532 nm could produce a typical ZnO crystal with apparent orientation. The observed modifications in the films structure and morphology were attributed to the laser treatment-mediated thermal effect. FESEM analysis of the films revealed the existence of varied nanostructures depending on the laser wavelength. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of ZNFs exhibited a broad UV excitonic band and a narrow visible band related to defects. The laser irradiation induced generation of the oxygen vacancies were observed to reduce the electrical resistivity of the films and altered the optical band gap energies. Sample annealed at 355 nm disclosed the lowest resistivity of 23.532 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> Ω cm. Raman spectra of ZNFs confirmed the existence of hexagonal ZnO wurtzite structure. The narrowing of the E<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>high</SUP> (437 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>) Raman phonon mode due to further annealing indicated an improvement in the films crystallinity and reduction in the local atomic defects related to the oxygen vacancy (V<SUB>O</SUB><SUP>+2</SUP>). XPS analyses showed an improvement crystallinity and chemisorption of oxygen into the grain boundaries of the films due to the laser treatment in air at lower wavelength. In short, the pulsed laser annealing of ZNFs were established to be far more efficient process for the oxidation of Zn to ZnO than conventional annealing procedures.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021OptMa.11511028A
Search for period changes in Mira stars;;We reobserved in the RC and i(Sloan) bands, during the years 2020-2021, seven Mira variables in Cassiopeia, for which historical i(Sloan) light curves were available from Asiago Observatory plates taken in the years 1967-84. The aim was to check if any of them had undergone a substantial change in the period or in the light curve shape. Very recent public data form ZTF-DR5 were also used to expand our time base window. A marked color change was detected for all the stars along their variability cycle. The star V890 Cas showed a significant period decrease of 12% from 483 to 428 days, one of the largest known to date. All the stars, save AV Cas, showed a smaller variation amplitude in the recent CCD data, possibly due to a photometric accuracy higher than that of the photographic plates.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021OEJV..216....1N
A concordance scenario for the observed neutrino from a tidal disruption event;;During a tidal disruption event, a star is torn apart by the tidal forces of a supermassive black hole, with about 50% of the star's mass eventually accreted by the black hole. The resulting flare can, in extreme cases of super-Eddington mass accretion, result in a relativistic jet<SUP>1-4</SUP>. While tidal disruption events have been theoretically proposed as sources of high-energy cosmic rays<SUP>5,6</SUP> and neutrinos<SUP>7-14</SUP>, stacking searches indicate that their contribution to the diffuse extragalactic neutrino flux is very low<SUP>15</SUP>. However, a recent association of a track-like astrophysical neutrino (IceCube-191001A<SUP>16</SUP>) with a tidal disruption event (AT2019dsg<SUP>17</SUP>) indicates that some tidal disruption events can accelerate cosmic rays to petaelectronvolt energies. Here we introduce a phenomenological concordance scenario with a relativistic jet to explain this association: an expanding cocoon progressively obscures the X-rays emitted by the accretion disk, while at the same time providing a sufficiently intense external target of backscattered X-rays for the production of neutrinos via proton-photon interactions. We also reproduce the delay (relative to the peak) of the neutrino emission by scaling the production radius with the black-body radius. Our energetics and assumptions for the jet and the cocoon are compatible with expectations from numerical simulations of tidal disruption events.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatAs...5..472W
Transient-optimized real-bogus classification with Bayesian convolutional neural networks - sifting the GOTO candidate stream;;Large-scale sky surveys have played a transformative role in our understanding of astrophysical transients, only made possible by increasingly powerful machine learning-based filtering to accurately sift through the vast quantities of incoming data generated. In this paper, we present a new real-bogus classifier based on a Bayesian convolutional neural network that provides nuanced, uncertainty-aware classification of transient candidates in difference imaging, and demonstrate its application to the datastream from the GOTO wide-field optical survey. Not only are candidates assigned a well-calibrated probability of being real, but also an associated confidence that can be used to prioritize human vetting efforts and inform future model optimization via active learning. To fully realize the potential of this architecture, we present a fully automated training set generation method which requires no human labelling, incorporating a novel data-driven augmentation method to significantly improve the recovery of faint and nuclear transient sources. We achieve competitive classification accuracy (FPR and FNR both below 1 per cent) compared against classifiers trained with fully human-labelled data sets, while being significantly quicker and less labour-intensive to build. This data-driven approach is uniquely scalable to the upcoming challenges and data needs of next-generation transient surveys. We make our data generation and model training codes available to the community.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.4838K
Variability, periodicity, and contact binaries in WISE;;The time-series component of Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is a valuable resource for the study of variable objects. We present an analysis of an all-sky sample of ~450 000 AllWISE+NEOWISE infrared light curves of likely variables identified in AllWISE. By computing periodograms of all these sources, we identify ~56 000 periodic variables. Of these, ~42 000 are short-period (P < 1 d), near-contact, or contact eclipsing binaries, many of which are on the main sequence. We use the periodic and aperiodic variables to test computationally inexpensive methods of periodic variable classification and identification, utilizing various measures of the probability distribution function of fluxes and of time-scales of variability. The combination of variability measures from our periodogram and non-parametric analyses with infrared colours from WISE and absolute magnitudes, colours, and variability amplitude from Gaia is useful for the identification and classification of periodic variables. Furthermore, we show that the effectiveness of non-parametric methods for the identification of periodic variables is comparable to that of the periodogram but at a much lower computational cost. Future surveys can utilize these methods to accelerate more traditional time-series analyses and to identify evolving sources missed by periodogram-based selections.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.3975P
Core-collapse, superluminous, and gamma-ray burst supernova host galaxy populations at low redshift: the importance of dwarf and starbursting galaxies;;We present a comprehensive study of an unbiased sample of 150 nearby (median redshift, z = 0.014) core-collapse supernova (CCSN) host galaxies drawn from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) for direct comparison to the nearest long-duration gamma-ray burst (LGRB) and superluminous supernova (SLSN) hosts. We use public imaging surveys to gather multiwavelength photometry for all CCSN host galaxies and fit their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to derive stellar masses and integrated star formation rates (SFRs). CCSNe populate galaxies across a wide range of stellar masses, from blue and compact dwarf galaxies to large spiral galaxies. We find 33$^{+4}_{-4}$ per cent of CCSNe are in dwarf galaxies (M<SUB>*</SUB> < 10<SUP>9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) and 2$^{+2}_{-1}$ per cent are in dwarf starburst galaxies [specific star formation rate (sSFR) > 10<SUP>-8</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>]. We reanalyse low-redshift SLSN and LGRB hosts from the literature (out to z < 0.3) in a homogeneous way and compare against the CCSN host sample. The relative SLSN to CCSN supernova rate is increased in low-mass galaxies and at high sSFRs. These parameters are strongly covariant and we cannot break the degeneracy between them with our current sample, although there is some evidence that both factors may play a role. Larger unbiased samples of CCSNe from projects such as ZTF and LSST will be needed to determine whether host-galaxy mass (a proxy for metallicity) or sSFR (a proxy for star formation intensity and potential IMF variation) is more fundamental in driving the preference for SLSNe and LGRBs in unusual galaxy environments.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.3931T
An early peak in the radio light curve of short-duration gamma-ray burst 200826A;;We present the results of radio observations from the eMERLIN telescope combined with X-ray data from Swift for the short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) 200826A, located at a redshift of 0.71. The radio light curve shows evidence of a sharp rise, a peak around 4-5 d post-burst, followed by a relatively steep decline. We provide two possible interpretations based on the time at which the light curve reached its peak. (1) If the light curve peaks earlier, the peak is produced by the synchrotron self-absorption frequency moving through the radio band, resulting from the forward shock propagating into a wind medium and (2) if the light curve peaks later, the turnover in the light curve is caused by a jet break. In the former case we find a minimum equipartition energy of ~3 × 10<SUP>47</SUP> erg and bulk Lorentz factor of ~5, while in the latter case we estimate the jet opening angle of ~9-16°. Due to the lack of data, it is impossible to determine which is the correct interpretation, however due to its relative simplicity and consistency with other multiwavelength observations which hint at the possibility that GRB 200826A is in fact a long GRB, we prefer the scenario one over scenario two.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.2966R
GPU-accelerated periodic source identification in large-scale surveys: measuring P and P;;Many inspiraling and merging stellar remnants emit both gravitational and electromagnetic radiation as they orbit or collide. These gravitational wave events together with their associated electromagnetic counterparts provide insight about the nature of the merger, allowing us to further constrain properties of the binary. With the future launch of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), follow-up observations and models are needed of ultracompact binary (UCB) systems. Current and upcoming long baseline time domain surveys will observe many of these UCBs. We present a new fast periodic object search tool capable of searching for generic periodic signals based on the conditional entropy algorithm. This new implementation allows for a grid search over both the period (P) and the time derivative of the period ( $\dot{P}$ ). To demonstrate the usage of this tool, we use a small, hand-picked subset of a UCB population generated from the population synthesis code COSMIC , as well as a custom catalogue for varying periods at fixed intrinsic parameters. We simulate light curves as likely to be observed by future time domain surveys by using an existing eclipsing binary light-curve model accounting for the change in orbital period due to gravitational radiation. We find that a search with $\dot{P}$ values is necessary for detecting binaries at orbital periods less than ∼10 min. We also show it is useful in finding and characterizing binaries with longer periods, but at a higher computational cost. Our code is called GCE (GPU-accelerated Conditional Entropy). It is available on Github (https://github.com/mikekatz04/gce).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.2665K
A self-lensing binary massive black hole interpretation of quasi-periodic eruptions;;Binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) systems result from galaxy mergers, and will eventually coalesce due to gravitational wave (GW) emission if the binary separation can be reduced to ≲0.1 pc by other mechanisms. Here, we explore a gravitational self-lensing binary SMBH model for the sharp (duration ~1 h), quasi-regular X-ray flares - dubbed quasi-periodic eruptions - recently observed from two low-mass active galactic nuclei: GSN 069 and RX J1301.9+2747. In our model, the binary is observed ~edge-on, such that each SMBH gravitationally lenses light from the accretion disc surrounding the other SMBH twice per orbital period. The model can reproduce the flare spacings if the current eccentricity of RX J1301.9+2747 is ϵ<SUB>0</SUB> ≳ 0.16, implying a merger within ~1000 yr. However, we cannot reproduce the observed flare profiles with our current calculations. Model flares with the correct amplitude are ~2/5 the observed duration, and model flares with the correct duration are ~2/5 the observed amplitude. Our modelling yields three distinct behaviours of self-lensing binary systems that can be searched for in current and future X-ray and optical time-domain surveys: (i) periodic lensing flares, (ii) partial eclipses (caused by occultation of the background mini-disc by the foreground mini-disc), and (iii) partial eclipses with a very sharp in-eclipse lensing flare. Discovery of such features would constitute very strong evidence for the presence of a supermassive binary, and monitoring of the flare spacings will provide a measurement of periastron precession.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.1703I
Horizontal spreading of planetary debris accreted by white dwarfs;;White dwarfs with metal-polluted atmospheres have been studied widely in the context of the accretion of rocky debris from evolved planetary systems. One open question is the geometry of accretion and how material arrives and mixes in the white dwarf surface layers. Using the three-dimensional (3D) radiation hydrodynamics code CO<SUP>5</SUP>BOLD, we present the first transport coefficients in degenerate star atmospheres that describe the advection-diffusion of a passive scalar across the surface plane. We couple newly derived horizontal diffusion coefficients with previously published vertical diffusion coefficients to provide theoretical constraints on surface spreading of metals in white dwarfs. Our grid of 3D simulations probes the vast majority of the parameter space of convective white dwarfs, with pure-hydrogen atmospheres in the effective temperature range of 6000-18 000 K and pure-helium atmospheres in the range of 12 000-34 000 K. Our results suggest that warm hydrogen-rich atmospheres (DA; ${rsim} 13\, 000$ K) and helium-rich atmospheres (DB and DBA; ${rsim} 30\, 000$ K) are unable to efficiently spread the accreted metals across their surface, regardless of the time dependence of accretion. This result may be at odds with the current non-detection of surface abundance variations in white dwarfs with debris discs. For cooler hydrogen- and helium-rich atmospheres, we predict a largely homogeneous distribution of metals across the surface within a vertical diffusion time-scale. This is typically less than 0.1 per cent of disc lifetime estimates, a quantity that is revisited in this paper using the overshoot results. These results have relevance for studies of the bulk composition of evolved planetary systems and models of accretion disc physics.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.1646C
Observational insights on the origin of giant low surface brightness galaxies;;Giant low surface brightness galaxies (gLSBGs) with dynamically cold stellar discs reaching the radius of 130 kpc challenge currently considered galaxy formation mechanisms. We analyse new deep long-slit optical spectroscopic observations, archival optical images, and published HI and optical spectroscopic data for a sample of seven gLSBGs, for which we performed mass modelling and estimated the parameters of dark matter haloes assuming the Burkert dark matter density profile. Our sample is not homogeneous by morphology, parameters of stellar populations, and total mass, however, six of seven galaxies sit on the high-mass extension of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. In UGC 1382, we detected a global counterrotation of the stellar high surface brightness (HSB) disc with respect to the extended LSB disc. In UGC 1922 with signatures of a possible merger, the gas counterrotation is seen in the inner disc. Six galaxies host active galactic nuclei, three of which have the estimated black hole masses substantially below those expected for their (pseudo-)bulge properties suggesting poor merger histories. Overall, the morphology, internal dynamics, and low star formation efficiency in the outer discs indicate that the three formation scenarios shape gLSBGs: (i) a two-stage formation when an HSB galaxy is formed first and then grows an LSB disc by accreting gas from an external supply; (ii) an unusual shallow and extended dark matter halo; (iii) a major merger with fine-tuned orbital parameters and morphologies of the merging galaxies.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503..830S
RINGO3 polarimetry of very young ZTF supernovae;;The early phases of the observed evolution of the supernovae (SNe) are expected to be dominated by the shock breakout and 'flash' ionization of the surrounding circumstellar medium. This material arises from the last stages of the evolution of the progenitor, such that photometry and spectroscopy of SNe at early times can place vital constraints on the latest and fastest evolutionary phases leading up to stellar death. These signatures are erased by the expansion of the ejecta within ~5 d after explosion. Here we present the earliest constraints, to date, on the polarization of 10 transients discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), between 2018 June and 2019 August. Rapid polarimetric follow-up was conducted using the Liverpool Telescope RINGO3 instrument, including three SNe observed within <1 d of detection by the ZTF. The limits on the polarization within the first 5 d of explosion, for all SN types, is generally $ 2{ per\ cent}$, implying early asymmetries are limited to axial ratios >0.65 (assuming an oblate spheroidal configuration). We also present polarimetric observations of the Type I Superluminous SN 2018bsz and Type II SN 2018hna, observed around and after maximum light.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503..312M
The ASAS-SN catalogue of variable stars IX: The spectroscopic properties of Galactic variable stars;;The All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae provides long baseline (~4 yr) V-band light curves for sources brighter than V≲ 17 mag across the whole sky. We produced V-band light curves for a total of ~61.5 million sources and systematically searched these sources for variability. We identified ~426 000 variables, including ~219 000 new discoveries. Most (${\sim }74{ per\ cent}$) of our discoveries are in the Southern hemisphere. Here, we use spectroscopic information from LAMOST, GALAH, RAVE, and APOGEE to study the physical and chemical properties of these variables. We find that metal-poor eclipsing binaries have orbital periods that are shorter than metal-rich systems at fixed temperature. We identified rotational variables on the main-sequence, red giant branch, and the red clump. A substantial fraction (${rsim }80{ per\ cent}$) of the rotating giants have large $v$<SUB>rot</SUB> or large near-ultraviolet excesses also indicative of fast rotation. The rotational variables have unusual abundances suggestive of analysis problems. Semiregular variables tend to be lower metallicity ($\rm [Fe/H]{\sim }-0.5$) than most giant stars. We find that the APOGEE DR16 temperatures of oxygen-rich semiregular variables are strongly correlated with the W<SUB>RP</SUB> - W<SUB>JK</SUB> colour index for $\rm T_{eff}\lesssim 3800$ K. Using abundance measurements from APOGEE DR16, we find evidence for Mg and N enrichment in the semiregular variables. We find that the Aluminum abundances of the semiregular variables are strongly correlated with the pulsation period, where the variables with $\rm Prsim 60$ d are significantly depleted in Al.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503..200J
Progress in neutrino astronomy;;The dream of observing our universe through neutrinos is rapidly becoming a reality. More than three decades after the first observation of neutrinos from beyond our solar system associated with Supernova SN1987A, neutrino astronomy is in the midst of a revolution. Extraterrestrial neutrinos are now routinely detected, following the discovery of a high-energy diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux in 2013. The detection of a high-energy neutrino in coincidence with a flaring blazar in 2017 has brought the field rapidly into the multi-messenger science era. The latest developments in the field of neutrino astronomy are reviewed and prospects with current and future detectors discussed. Particular emphasis is put on domestic programs in neutrino astronomy and the possibility to construct a large neutrino observatory in Korea.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JKPS...78..864R
Precovery Observations Confirm the Capture Time of Asteroid 2020 CD3 as Earth's Minimoon;;Asteroid 2020 CD3 was discovered on 2020 February 15 by the Catalina Sky Survey while it was temporarily captured in a geocentric orbit before escaping Earth's Hill sphere on 2020 March 7. We searched archival images and found precoveries of 2020 CD3 from the Dark Energy Camera and Catalina Sky survey. The Dark Energy Camera images yielded three observations on 2019 January 17, while the Catalina Sky Survey images yielded four observations on 2019 January 24 from the Mt. Lemmon telescope and four observations on 2018 May 9 from the Mt. Bigelow telescope. These precovery observations allowed us to refine the orbit of 2020 CD3 and determine that it was captured in a geocentric orbit on 2017 September 15 after a close approach to the Moon at a distance of 11,974 ± 10 km. We analyzed the trajectory of 2020 CD3 to look for potential Earth impacts within the next 100 years and find a ≳1% probability of an impact between 2061 and 2120 depending on nongravitational force model assumptions. The small size of 2020 CD3, about 1 to 2 m, makes any potential impact harmless.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...913L...6N
Searches after Gravitational Waves Using ARizona Observatories (SAGUARO): Observations and Analysis from Advanced LIGO/Virgo's Third Observing Run;;With the conclusion of the third observing run for Advanced LIGO/Virgo (O3), we present a detailed analysis of both triggered and serendipitous observations of 17 gravitational-wave (GW) events (7 triggered and 10 purely serendipitous) from the Searches After Gravitational-waves Using ARizona Observatories (SAGUARO) program. We searched a total of 4935 deg<SUP>2</SUP> down to a median 5σ transient detection depth of 21.1 AB mag using the Mt. Lemmon 1.5 m telescope, the discovery engine for SAGUARO. In addition to triggered events within 24 hr, our transient search encompassed a time interval following GW events of <120 hr, providing observations on ∼1/2 of the events accessible to the Mt. Lemmon 1.5 m telescope. We covered 2.1%-86% of the LVC total probability (P<SUB>total</SUB>) for individual events, with a median P<SUB>total</SUB> ≈ 8% within <120 hr. Following improvements to our pipeline and the addition of serendipitous observations, we find a total of seven new optical candidates across five GW events, which we are unable to rule out after searching for additional information and comparing to kilonova models. Using both publicly available and our own late-time data, we investigated a total of 252 optical candidates for these 17 events, finding that only 65% were followed up in some capacity by the community. Of the total 252 candidates, we are able to rule out an additional 12 previously reported counterpart candidates. In light of these results, we discuss lessons learned from the SAGUARO GW counterpart search. We discuss how community coordination of observations and candidate follow-up, as well as the role of archival data, are crucial to improving the efficiency of follow-up efforts and preventing unnecessary duplication of effort with limited electromagnetic resources.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912..128P
I Spy Transits and Pulsations: Empirical Variability in White Dwarfs Using Gaia and the Zwicky Transient Facility;;We present a novel method to detect variable astrophysical objects and transient phenomena using anomalous excess scatter in repeated measurements from public catalogs of Gaia DR2 and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) DR3 photometry. We first provide a generalized, all-sky proxy for variability using only Gaia DR2 photometry, calibrated to white dwarf stars. To ensure more robust candidate detection, we further employ a method combining Gaia with ZTF photometry and alerts. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply this latter technique to a sample of roughly 12,100 white dwarfs within 200 pc centered on the ZZ Ceti instability strip, where hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs are known to pulsate. By inspecting the top 1% of the samples ranked by these methods, we demonstrate that both the Gaia-only and ZTF-informed techniques are highly effective at identifying known and new variable white dwarfs, which we verify using follow-up, high-speed photometry. We confirm variability in all 33 out of 33 (100%) observed white dwarfs within our top 1% highest-ranked candidates, both inside and outside the ZZ Ceti instability strip. In addition to dozens of new pulsating white dwarfs, we also identify five white dwarfs highly likely to show transiting planetary debris; if confirmed, these systems would more than triple the number of white dwarfs known to host transiting debris.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912..125G
A Large Fraction of Hydrogen-rich Supernova Progenitors Experience Elevated Mass Loss Shortly Prior to Explosion;;Spectroscopic detection of narrow emission lines traces the presence of circumstellar mass distributions around massive stars exploding as core-collapse supernovae. Transient emission lines disappearing shortly after the supernova explosion suggest that the material spatial extent is compact and implies an increased mass loss shortly prior to explosion. Here, we present a systematic survey for such transient emission lines (Flash Spectroscopy) among Type II supernovae detected in the first year of the Zwicky Transient Facility survey. We find that at least six out of ten events for which a spectrum was obtained within two days of the estimated explosion time show evidence for such transient flash lines. Our measured flash event fraction (>30% at 95% confidence level) indicates that elevated mass loss is a common process occurring in massive stars that are about to explode as supernovae.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912...46B
Late-time Radio and Millimeter Observations of Superluminous Supernovae and Long Gamma-Ray Bursts: Implications for Central Engines, Fast Radio Bursts, and Obscured Star Formation;;We present the largest and deepest late-time radio and millimeter survey to date of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) to search for associated nonthermal synchrotron emission. Using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we observed 43 sources at 6 and 100 GHz on a timescale of ∼ 1-19 yr post-explosion. We do not detect radio/millimeter emission from any of the sources, with the exception of a 6 GHz detection of PTF10hgi, as well as the detection of 6 GHz emission near the location of the SLSN PTF12dam, which we associate with its host galaxy. We use our data to place constraints on central engine emission due to magnetar wind nebulae and off-axis relativistic jets. We also explore nonrelativistic emission from the SN ejecta, and place constraints on obscured star formation in the host galaxies. In addition, we conduct a search for fast radio bursts (FRBs) from some of the sources using VLA phased-array observations; no FRBs are detected to a limit of 16 mJy (7σ; 10 ms duration) in about 40 minutes on source per event. A comparison to theoretical models suggests that continued radio monitoring may lead to detections of persistent radio emission on timescales of ≳ a decade.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912...21E
Probing the Disk-Corona Systems and Broad-line Regions of Changing-look Quasars with X-Ray and Optical Observations;;"Changing-look" quasars are a new class of highly variable active galactic nuclei that have changed their spectral type over surprisingly short timescales of just a few years. The origin of this phenomenon is debated, but is likely to reflect some change in the accretion flow. To investigate the disk-corona systems in these objects, we measure optical/UV-X-ray spectral indices ( ${\alpha }_{\mathrm{OX}}$ ) and Eddington ratios ( ${\lambda }_{\mathrm{Edd}}$ ) of 10 previously discovered changing-look quasars at two or more epochs. By comparing these data with simulated results based on the behavior of X-ray binaries, we find possible similarities in spectral indices below the 1% Eddington ratio. We further investigate the Eddington ratios of changing-look quasars before and after their spectral type changes, and find that changing-look quasars cross the 1% Eddington ratio boundary when their broad emission lines disappear/emerge. This is consistent with the disk-wind model as the origin of broad emission lines.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912...20J
A Population of Heavily Reddened, Optically Missed Novae from Palomar Gattini-IR: Constraints on the Galactic Nova Rate;;The nova rate in the Milky Way remains largely uncertain, despite its vital importance in constraining models of Galactic chemical evolution as well as understanding progenitor channels for Type Ia supernovae. The rate has been previously estimated to be in the range of ≈10-300 yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, either based on extrapolations from a handful of very bright optical novae or the nova rates in nearby galaxies; both methods are subject to debatable assumptions. The total discovery rate of optical novae remains much smaller (≈5-10 yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) than these estimates, even with the advent of all-sky optical time-domain surveys. Here, we present a systematic sample of 12 spectroscopically confirmed Galactic novae detected in the first 17 months of Palomar Gattini-IR (PGIR), a wide-field near-infrared time-domain survey. Operating in the J band (≈1.2 μm), which is significantly less affected by dust extinction compared to optical bands, the extinction distribution of the PGIR sample is highly skewed to a large extinction values (>50% of events obscured by A<SUB>V</SUB> ≳ 5 mag). Using recent estimates for the distribution of Galactic mass and dust, we show that the extinction distribution of the PGIR sample is commensurate with dust models. The PGIR extinction distribution is inconsistent with that reported in previous optical searches (null-hypothesis probability <0.01%), suggesting that a large population of highly obscured novae have been systematically missed in previous optical searches. We perform the first quantitative simulation of a 3π time-domain survey to estimate the Galactic nova rate using PGIR, and derive a rate of $\approx {43.7}_{-8.7}^{+19.5}$ yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Our results suggest that all-sky near-infrared time-domain surveys are well poised to uncover the Galactic nova population.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912...19D
Detectability of "Merger-nova" Emission from a Long-lived Magnetar in Short Gamma-Ray Bursts;;One possible progenitor of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is thought to be from a double neutron star (NS) merger, and the remnant of such a merger may be a supramassive NS, which is supported by rigid rotation and through its survival of hundreds of seconds before collapsing into a black hole (BH). If this is the case, an optical/infrared transient (namely merger-nova) is generated from the ejected materials and it is powered by radioactive decay from r-process, spin-down energy from a supramassive NS, as well as the magnetic wind from a newborn BH. In this paper, we systematically search for the signature of a supramassive NS central engine by analyzing the X-ray emission of short GRBs with internal plateau observed by Swift, and we find that five candidates of short GRBs have such a feature with redshift measurement. Then, we calculate the possible merger-nova emission from those candidates given the typical model parameters by considering the above three energy sources, and compare its brightness with the sensitivity of some optical telescopes. We find that the merger-nova emission of GRB 060801 in K-, r-, and U-bands with variations of M<SUB>ej</SUB> (10<SUP>-4</SUP>-10<SUP>-2</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), κ (0.1-10 cm<SUP>2</SUP> g<SUP>-1</SUP>), and β (0.1-0.3) is very difficult to detect using the Vera C. Rubin, Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS), the Zwicky Transient Facility, and the Roman Space Telescope (Roman), except for the case of large ejecta mass M<SUB>ej</SUB> = 10<SUP>-2</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. However, we are very hopeful to detect the merger-nova emission of GRBs 090515, 100625A, and 101219A using more sensitive instruments, such as Vera C. Rubin, Pan-STARRS, and Roman. Moreover, the merger-nova emission of GRB 160821B is bright enough to detect in our calculations, and it is also consistent with current real observations of merger-nova emission.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912...14Y
The Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE) Alert Broker;;We introduce the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE) broker, an astronomical alert broker designed to provide a rapid and self-consistent classification of large etendue telescope alert streams, such as that provided by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and, in the future, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). ALeRCE is a Chilean-led broker run by an interdisciplinary team of astronomers and engineers working to become intermediaries between survey and follow-up facilities. ALeRCE uses a pipeline that includes the real-time ingestion, aggregation, cross-matching, machine-learning (ML) classification, and visualization of the ZTF alert stream. We use two classifiers: a stamp-based classifier, designed for rapid classification, and a light curve-based classifier, which uses the multiband flux evolution to achieve a more refined classification. We describe in detail our pipeline, data products, tools, and services, which are made public for the community (see https://alerce.science). Since we began operating our real-time ML classification of the ZTF alert stream in early 2019, we have grown a large community of active users around the globe. We describe our results to date, including the real-time processing of 1.5 × 10<SUP>8</SUP> alerts, the stamp classification of 3.4 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> objects, the light-curve classification of 1.1 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> objects, the report of 6162 supernova candidates, and different experiments using LSST-like alert streams. Finally, we discuss the challenges ahead in going from a single stream of alerts such as ZTF to a multistream ecosystem dominated by LSST.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....161..242F
Outbursting Young Stellar Object PGIR 20dci in the Perseus Arm;;We report the discovery of a likely outbursting Class I young stellar object, associated with the star-forming region NGC 281-W (distance ∼2.8 kpc). The source is currently seen only at infrared wavelengths, appearing in both the Palomar Gattini InfraRed (1.2 μm) and the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (3.4 and 4.6 μm) photometric time-domain surveys. Recent near-infrared imaging reveals a new, extended scattered light nebula. Recent near-infrared spectroscopy confirms the similarity of PGIR 20dci to FU Ori-type sources, based on strong molecular absorption in CO, H<SUB>2</SUB>O, and OH; weak absorption in several atomic lines; and a warm wind/outflow as indicated by a P Cygni profile in the He I λ10830 line. This is a rare case of an FU Ori star with a well-measured long-term photometric rise before a sharper outburst, and the second instance of an FU Ori star with a documented two-step brightening in the mid-infrared.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....161..220H
Tails: Chasing Comets with the Zwicky Transient Facility and Deep Learning;;We present Tails, an open-source deep-learning framework for the identification and localization of comets in the image data of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), a robotic optical time-domain survey currently in operation at the Palomar Observatory in California, USA. Tails employs a custom EfficientDet-based architecture and is capable of finding comets in single images in near real time, rather than requiring multiple epochs as with traditional methods. The system achieves state-of-the-art performance with 99% recall, a 0.01% false-positive rate, and a 1-2 pixel rms error in the predicted position. We report the initial results of the Tails efficiency evaluation in a production setting on the data of the ZTF Twilight survey, including the first AI-assisted discovery of a comet (C/2020 T2) and the recovery of a comet (P/2016 J3 = P/2021 A3).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....161..218D
The luminous and rapidly evolving SN 2018bcc. Clues toward the origin of Type Ibn SNe from the Zwicky Transient Facility;;Context. Supernovae (SNe) Type Ibn are rapidly evolving and bright (M<SUB>R, peak</SUB> ∼ −19) transients interacting with He-rich circumstellar material (CSM). SN 2018bcc, detected by the ZTF shortly after explosion, provides the best constraints on the shape of the rising light curve (LC) of a fast Type Ibn. 
 Aims: We used the high-quality data set of SN 2018bcc to study observational signatures of the class. Additionally, the powering mechanism of SN 2018bcc offers insights into the debated progenitor connection of Type Ibn SNe. 
 Methods: We compared well-constrained LC properties obtained from empirical models with the literature. We fit the pseudo-bolometric LC with semi-analytical models powered by radioactive decay and CSM interaction. Finally, we modeled the line profiles and emissivity of the prominent He I lines, in order to study the formation of P-Cygni profiles and to estimate CSM properties. 
 Results: SN 2018bcc had a rise time to peak of the LC of 5.6<SUB>−0.1</SUB><SUP>+0.2</SUP> days in the restframe with a rising shape power-law index close to 2, and seems to be a typical rapidly evolving Type Ibn SN. The spectrum lacked signatures of SN-like ejecta and was dominated by over 15 He emission features at 20 days past peak, alongside Ca and Mg, all with V<SUB>FWHM</SUB> ∼ 2000 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>. The luminous and rapidly evolving LC could be powered by CSM interaction but not by the decay of radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni. Modeling of the He I lines indicated a dense and optically thick CSM that can explain the P-Cygni profiles. 
 Conclusions: Like other rapidly evolving Type Ibn SNe, SN 2018bcc is a luminous transient with a rapid rise to peak powered by shock interaction inside a dense and He-rich CSM. Its spectra do not support the existence of two Type Ibn spectral classes. We also note the remarkable observational match to pulsational pair instability SN models.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...649A.163K
Core-collapse supernova subtypes in luminous infrared galaxies;;The fraction of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) occurring in the central regions of galaxies is not well constrained at present. This is partly because large-scale transient surveys operate at optical wavelengths, making it challenging to detect transient sources that occur in regions susceptible to high extinction factors. Here we present the discovery and follow-up observations of two CCSNe that occurred in the luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) NGC 3256. The first, SN 2018ec, was discovered using the ESO HAWK-I/GRAAL adaptive optics seeing enhancer, and was classified as a Type Ic with a host galaxy extinction of A<SUB>V</SUB> = 2.1<SUB>−0.1</SUB><SUP>+0.3</SUP> mag. The second, AT 2018cux, was discovered during the course of follow-up observations of SN 2018ec, and is consistent with a subluminous Type IIP classification with an A<SUB>V</SUB> = 2.1 ± 0.4 mag of host extinction. A third CCSN, PSN J10275082−4354034 in NGC 3256, was previously reported in 2014, and we recovered the source in late-time archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging. Based on template light curve fitting, we favour a Type IIn classification for it with modest host galaxy extinction of A<SUB>V</SUB> = 0.3<SUB>−0.3</SUB><SUP>+0.4</SUP> mag. We also extend our study with follow-up data of the recent Type IIb SN 2019lqo and Type Ib SN 2020fkb that occurred in the LIRG system Arp 299 with host extinctions of A<SUB>V</SUB> = 2.1<SUB>−0.3</SUB><SUP>+0.1</SUP> and A<SUB>V</SUB> = 0.4<SUB>−0.2</SUB><SUP>+0.1</SUP> mag, respectively. Motivated by the above, we inspected, for the first time, a sample of 29 CCSNe located within a projected distance of 2.5 kpc from the host galaxy nuclei in a sample of 16 LIRGs. We find, if star formation within these galaxies is modelled assuming a global starburst episode and normal IMF, that there is evidence of a correlation between the starburst age and the CCSN subtype. We infer that the two subgroups of 14 H-poor (Type IIb/Ib/Ic/Ibn) and 15 H-rich (Type II/IIn) CCSNe have different underlying progenitor age distributions, with the H-poor progenitors being younger at 3σ significance. However, we note that the currently available sample sizes of CCSNe and host LIRGs are small, and the statistical comparisons between subgroups do not take into account possible systematic or model errors related to the estimated starburst ages.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...649A.134K
A transmission spectrum of the planet candidate WD 1856+534 b and a lower limit to its mass;;The cool white dwarf WD 1856+534 was found to be transited by a Jupiter-sized object with a mass at or below 14 M<SUB>Jup</SUB>. We used the GTC telescope to obtain and analyse the photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy of six transits of WD 1856+534 b, with the intention of deriving the slope of the transmission spectrum. Such a slope, assuming a cloud-free atmosphere dominated by Rayleigh scattering of the particles in its atmosphere, could be translated into an estimation of the mass of WD 1856+534 b. However, the resultant transmission spectrum is essentially flat and therefore permits only the determination of lower mass limits of 2.4 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> at the 2σ level, or 1.6 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> at 3σ. These limits have implications for some of the formation scenarios proposed for the object. We elaborate on the potential effects of clouds and hazes in our estimations, based on previous studies of Jupiter and Titan. In addition, we detected an Hα absorption feature in the combined spectrum of the host white dwarf, which leads to the assignation of a DA classification and allows the derivation of an independent set of atmospheric parameters. Furthermore, the epochs of five transits were measured with sub-second precision, which demonstrates that additional objects more massive than ≈5 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> and with periods longer than O(100) days could be detected through the light-time effect.

Redshift evolution of the underlying type Ia supernova stretch distribution;;The detailed nature of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) remains uncertain, and as survey statistics increase, the question of astrophysical systematic uncertainties arises, notably that of the evolution of SN Ia populations. We study the dependence on redshift of the SN Ia SALT2.4 light-curve stretch, which is a purely intrinsic SN property, to probe its potential redshift drift. The SN stretch has been shown to be strongly correlated with the SN environment, notably with stellar age tracers. We modeled the underlying stretch distribution as a function of redshift, using the evolution of the fraction of young and old SNe Ia as predicted using the SNfactory dataset, and assuming a constant underlying stretch distribution for each age population consisting of Gaussian mixtures. We tested our prediction against published samples that were cut to have marginal magnitude selection effects, so that any observed change is indeed astrophysical and not observational in origin. In this first study, there are indications that the underlying SN Ia stretch distribution evolves as a function of redshift, and that the age drifting model is a better description of the data than any time-constant model, including the sample-based asymmetric distributions that are often used to correct Malmquist bias at a significance higher than 5σ. The favored underlying stretch model is a bimodal one, composed of a high-stretch mode shared by both young and old environments, and a low-stretch mode that is exclusive to old environments. The precise effect of the redshift evolution of the intrinsic properties of a SN Ia population on cosmology remains to be studied. The astrophysical drift of the SN stretch distribution does affect current Malmquist bias corrections, however, and thereby the distances that are derived based on SN that are affected by observational selection effects. We highlight that this bias will increase with surveys covering increasingly larger redshift ranges, which is particularly important for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...649A..74N
Gravitational tuning forks and hierarchical triple systems;;We study gravitational wave (GW) emission in the strong-field regime by a hierarchical triple system composed of a binary system placed in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). The LIGO-Virgo Collaboration recently reported evidence for coalescences with this dynamical origin. These systems are common in galactic centers and thus, are a target for the space-based LISA mission as well as other advanced detectors. Doppler shifts, aberration, lensing, and strong amplitude modulations are features present in the GW signal from these systems, built into our framework and with no need for phenomenological patches. We find that the binary can resonantly excite the quasinormal modes of the SMBH, as in the resonant excitation of two tuning forks with matching frequencies. The flux of energy crossing the SMBH horizon can be significant, when compared with that from standard extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. Therefore, these triple systems are excellent probes of strong-field physics and of the BH nature of compact objects.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PhRvD.103h1501C
Contemporaneous Multiwavelength and Precovery Observations of the Active Centaur P/2019 LD2 (ATLAS);;The Gateway Centaur and Jupiter co-orbital P/2019 LD2 (ATLAS) provides the first opportunity to observe the migration of a solar system small body from a Centaur orbit to a Jupiter Family Comet (JFC) four decades from now. The Gateway transition region is beyond where water ice can power cometary activity, and coma production there is as poorly understood as in all Centaurs. We present contemporaneous multiwavelength observations of LD2 from 2020 July 2-4: Gemini North visible imaging, NASA IRTF near-infrared spectroscopy, and ARO Submillimeter Telescope millimeter-wavelength spectroscopy. Precovery DECam images limit the nucleus's effective radius to ≤1.2 km and no large outbursts were seen in archival Catalina Sky Survey observations. LD2's coma has $g^{\prime} -r^{\prime} =0.70\pm 0.07$ , $r^{\prime} -i^{\prime} =0.26\pm 0.07$ , a dust-production rate of ∼10-20 kg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, and an outflow velocity between v ∼ 0.6-3.3 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We did not detect CO toward LD2 on 2020 July 2-3, with a 3σ upper limit of Q(CO) < 4.4 × 10<SUP>27</SUP> mol s<SUP>-1</SUP> (⪅ 200 kg s<SUP>-1</SUP>). Near-infrared spectra show evidence for water ice at the 1%-10% level depending on grain size. Spatial profiles and archival data are consistent with sustained activity. The evidence supports the hypothesis that LD2 is a typical small Centaur that will become a typical JFC, and thus, it is critical to understanding the transition between these two populations. Finally, we discuss potential strategies for a community-wide, long-baseline monitoring effort.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PSJ.....2...48K
Low-redshift Type Ia Supernova from the LSQ/LCO Collaboration;;This paper is the data release of a new sample of 140 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the LaSilla-QUEST/Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) collaboration. The discovery of the supernovae came from the LaSilla-QUEST variability survey, the ASASSN survey, as well as smaller low redshift supernova surveys. All of the supernovae in this sample were spectroscopically identified as SNe Ia using spectra from the PESSTO survey using the 3.5 m NTT telescope at LaSilla and spectra from the LCO 2 m Faulkes telescopes. The light-curves were obtained from a rapid cadence photometric follow up of the supernovae with the 9 LCO 1 m telescopes located at various observatories around the globe. Reference images of the host galaxies were taken approximately a year after the supernova have faded to allow precise galaxy background subtraction from the supernova magnitudes. The supernovae in this sample were discovered over a seven year period from 2012 October to 2019 June, and the last galaxy reference images were taken before 2020 June.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASP..133d4002B

X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions from two previously quiescent galaxies;;Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are very-high-amplitude bursts of X-ray radiation recurring every few hours and originating near the central supermassive black holes of galactic nuclei<SUP>1,2</SUP>. It is currently unknown what triggers these events, how long they last and how they are connected to the physical properties of the inner accretion flows. Previously, only two such sources were known, found either serendipitously or in archival data<SUP>1,2</SUP>, with emission lines in their optical spectra classifying their nuclei as hosting an actively accreting supermassive black hole<SUP>3,4</SUP>. Here we report observations of QPEs in two further galaxies, obtained with a blind and systematic search of half of the X-ray sky. The optical spectra of these galaxies show no signature of black hole activity, indicating that a pre-existing accretion flow that is typical of active galactic nuclei is not required to trigger these events. Indeed, the periods, amplitudes and profiles of the QPEs reported here are inconsistent with current models that invoke radiation-pressure-driven instabilities in the accretion disk<SUP>5-9</SUP>. Instead, QPEs might be driven by an orbiting compact object. Furthermore, their observed properties require the mass of the secondary object to be much smaller than that of the main body<SUP>10</SUP>, and future X-ray observations may constrain possible changes in their period owing to orbital evolution. This model could make QPEs a viable candidate for the electromagnetic counterparts of so-called extreme-mass-ratio inspirals<SUP>11-13</SUP>, with considerable implications for multi-messenger astrophysics and cosmology<SUP>14,15</SUP>.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021Natur.592..704A
Anomaly detection in the Zwicky Transient Facility DR3;;We present results from applying the SNAD anomaly detection pipeline to the third public data release of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF DR3). The pipeline is composed of three stages: feature extraction, search of outliers with machine learning algorithms, and anomaly identification with followup by human experts. Our analysis concentrates in three ZTF fields, comprising more than 2.25 million objects. A set of four automatic learning algorithms was used to identify 277 outliers, which were subsequently scrutinized by an expert. From these, 188 (68 per cent) were found to be bogus light curves - including effects from the image subtraction pipeline as well as overlapping between a star and a known asteroid, 66 (24 per cent) were previously reported sources whereas 23 (8 per cent) correspond to non-catalogued objects, with the two latter cases of potential scientific interest (e.g. one spectroscopically confirmed RS Canum Venaticorum star, four supernovae candidates, one red dwarf flare). Moreover, using results from the expert analysis, we were able to identify a simple bi-dimensional relation that can be used to aid filtering potentially bogus light curves in future studies. We provide a complete list of objects with potential scientific application so they can be further scrutinised by the community. These results confirm the importance of combining automatic machine learning algorithms with domain knowledge in the construction of recommendation systems for astronomy.

Hidden in plain sight: a double-lined white dwarf binary 26 pc away and a distant cousin;;We present high-resolution spectroscopy of two nearby white dwarfs with inconsistent spectroscopic and parallax distances. The first one, PG 1632+177, is a 13th magnitude white dwarf only 25.6 pc away. Previous spectroscopic observations failed to detect any radial velocity changes in this star. Here, we show that PG 1632+177 is a 2.05-d period double-lined spectroscopic binary (SB2) containing a low-mass He-core white dwarf with a more-massive, likely CO-core white dwarf companion. After L 870-2, PG 1632+177 becomes the second closest SB2 white dwarf currently known. Our second target, WD 1534+503, is also an SB2 system with an orbital period of 0.71 d. For each system, we constrain the atmospheric parameters of both components through a composite model-atmosphere analysis. We also present a new set of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) synthetic spectra appropriate for modelling high-resolution observations of cool white dwarfs, and show that NLTE effects in the core of the H α line increase with decreasing effective temperature. We discuss the orbital period and mass distribution of SB2 and eclipsing double white dwarfs with orbital constraints, and demonstrate that the observed population is consistent with the predicted period distribution from the binary population synthesis models. The latter predict more massive CO + CO white dwarf binaries at short (<1 d) periods, as well as binaries with several day orbital periods; such systems are still waiting to be discovered in large numbers.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.4972K
Evidence that short-period AM CVn systems are diverse in outburst behaviour;;We present results of our analysis of up to 15 yr of photometric data from eight AM CVn systems with orbital periods between 22.5 and 26.8 min. Our data have been collected from the GOTO, ZTF, Pan-STARRS, ASAS-SN, and Catalina all-sky surveys and amateur observations collated by the AAVSO. We find evidence that these interacting ultracompact binaries show a similar diversity of long-term optical properties as the hydrogen accreting dwarf novae. We found that AM CVn systems in the previously identified accretion disc instability region are not a homogenous group. Various members of the analysed sample exhibit behaviour reminiscent of Z Cam systems with long superoutbursts (SOs) and standstills, SU UMa systems with regular, shorter SOs, and nova-like systems that appear only in a high state. The addition of TESS full frame images of one of these systems, KL Dra, reveals the first evidence for normal outbursts appearing as a precursor to SOs in an AM CVn system. Our results will inform theoretical modelling of the outbursts of hydrogen deficient systems.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.4953D
Magnetic white dwarfs in post-common-envelope binaries;;Magnitude-limited samples have shown that 20-25 per cent of cataclysmic variables contain white dwarfs with magnetic fields of Mega Gauss strength, in stark contrast to the approximately 5 per cent of single white dwarfs with similar magnetic field strengths. Moreover, the lack of identifiable progenitor systems for magnetic cataclysmic variables leads to considerable challenges when trying to understand how these systems form and evolve. Here, we present a sample of six magnetic white dwarfs in detached binaries with low-mass stellar companions where we have constrained the stellar and binary parameters including, for the first time, reliable mass estimates for these magnetic white dwarfs. We find that they are systematically more massive than non-magnetic white dwarfs in detached binaries. These magnetic white dwarfs generally have cooling ages of more than 1 Gyr and reside in systems that are very close to Roche lobe filling. Our findings are more consistent with these systems being temporarily detached cataclysmic variables, rather than pre-cataclysmic binaries, but we cannot rule out the latter possibility. We find that these systems can display unusual asymmetric light curves that may offer a way to identify them in larger numbers in future. Seven new candidate magnetic white dwarf systems are also presented, three of which have asymmetric light curves. Finally, we note that several newly identified magnetic systems have archival spectra where there is no clear evidence of magnetism, meaning that these binaries have been previously missed. Nevertheless, there remains a clear lack of younger detached magnetic white dwarf systems.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.4305P
Exploring the diversity of double-detonation explosions for Type Ia supernovae: effects of the post-explosion helium shell composition;;The detonation of a helium shell on top of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf has been argued as a potential explosion mechanism for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The ash produced during helium shell burning can lead to light curves and spectra that are inconsistent with normal SNe Ia, but may be viable for some objects showing a light-curve bump within the days following explosion. We present a series of radiative transfer models designed to mimic predictions from double-detonation explosion models. We consider a range of core and shell masses, and systematically explore multiple post-explosion compositions for the helium shell. We find that a variety of luminosities and time-scales for early light-curve bumps result from those models with shells containing <SUP>56</SUP>Ni, <SUP>52</SUP>Fe, or <SUP>48</SUP>Cr. Comparing our models to SNe Ia with light-curve bumps, we find that these models can reproduce the shapes of almost all of the bumps observed, but only those objects with red colours around maximum light (B - V ≳ 1) are well matched throughout their evolution. Consistent with previous works, we also show that those models in which the shell does not contain iron-group elements provide good agreement with normal SNe Ia of different luminosities from shortly after explosion up to maximum light. While our models do not amount to positive evidence in favour of the double-detonation scenario, we show that provided the helium shell ash does not contain iron-group elements, it may be viable for a wide range of normal SNe Ia.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.3533M
Limits on mass outflow from optical tidal disruption events;;The discovery of optical/UV (ultraviolet) tidal disruption events (TDEs) was surprising. The expectation was that, upon returning to the pericentre, the stellar-debris stream will form a compact disc that will emit soft X-rays. Indeed, the first TDEs were discovered in this energy band. A common explanation for the optical/UV events is that surrounding optically thick matter reprocesses the disc's X-ray emission and emits it from a large photosphere. If accretion follows the super-Eddington mass infall rate, it would inevitably result in an energetic outflow, providing naturally the reprocessing matter. We describe here a new method to estimate, using the observed luminosity and temperature, the mass and energy of outflows from optical transients. When applying this method to a sample of supernovae, our estimates are consistent with a more detailed hydrodynamic modelling. For the current sample of a few dozen optical TDEs, the observed luminosity and temperature imply outflows that are significantly more massive than typical stellar masses, posing a problem to this common reprocessing picture.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.3385M
Discovering strongly lensed QSOs from unresolved light curves;;We present a new method of discovering galaxy-scale, strongly lensed QSO systems from unresolved light curves using the autocorrelation function. The method is tested on five rungs of simulated light curves from the Time Delay Challenge 1 that were designed to match the light-curve qualities from existing, ongoing, and forthcoming time-domain surveys such as the Medium Deep Survey of the Panoramic Survey Telescope And Rapid Response System 1, the Zwicky Transient Facility, and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time. Among simulated lens systems for which time delays can be successfully measured by current best algorithms, our method achieves an overall true-positive rate of 28-58 per cent for doubly imaged QSOs (doubles) and 36-60 per cent for quadruply imaged QSOs (quads) while maintains ≲10 per cent false-positive rates. We also apply the method to observed light curves of 22 known strongly lensed QSOs, and recover 20 per cent of doubles and 25 per cent of quads. The tests demonstrate the capability of our method for discovering strongly lensed QSOs from major time domain surveys. The performance of our method can be further improved by analysing multifilter light curves and supplementing with morphological, colour, and/or astrometric constraints. More importantly, our method is particularly useful for discovering small-separation strongly lensed QSOs, complementary to traditional imaging-based methods.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.2912S
Improving estimates of the growth rate using galaxy-velocity correlations: a simulation study;;We present an improved framework for estimating the growth rate of large-scale structure, using measurements of the galaxy-velocity cross-correlation in configuration space. We consider standard estimators of the velocity autocorrelation function, ψ<SUB>1</SUB> and ψ<SUB>2</SUB>, the two-point galaxy correlation function, ξ<SUB>gg</SUB>, and introduce a new estimator of the galaxy-velocity cross-correlation function, ψ<SUB>3</SUB>. By including pair counts measured from random catalogues of velocities and positions sampled from distributions characteristic of the true data, we find that the variance in the galaxy-velocity cross-correlation function is significantly reduced. Applying a covariance analysis and χ<SUP>2</SUP> minimization procedure to these statistics, we determine estimates and errors for the normalized growth rate fσ<SUB>8</SUB> and the parameter β = f/b, where b is the galaxy bias factor. We test this framework on mock hemisphere data sets for redshift z < 0.1 with realistic velocity noise constructed from the L-PICOLA simulation code, and find that we are able to recover the fiducial value of fσ<SUB>8</SUB> from the joint combination of ψ<SUB>1</SUB> + ψ<SUB>2</SUB> + ψ<SUB>3</SUB> + ξ<SUB>gg</SUB>, with 15 per cent accuracy from individual mocks. We also recover the fiducial fσ<SUB>8</SUB> to within 1σ regardless of the combination of correlation statistics used. When we consider all four statistics together we find that the statistical uncertainty in our measurement of the growth rate is reduced by $59{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ compared to the same analysis only considering ψ<SUB>2</SUB>, by $53{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ compared to the same analysis only considering ψ<SUB>1</SUB>, and by $52{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ compared to the same analysis jointly considering ψ<SUB>1</SUB> and ψ<SUB>2</SUB>.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.2087T
SN 2020ank: a bright and fast-evolving H-deficient superluminous supernova;;We investigate the observational properties of a hydrogen-deficient superluminous supernova (SLSN) SN 2020ank (at z = 0.2485), with the help of early phase observations carried out between -21 and +52 d since g-band maximum. Photometrically, SN 2020ank is one of the brightest SLSN ( $M_{\mathrm{ g,peak}}\, \sim$ -21.84 ± 0.10 mag), having fast pre-peak rising and post-peak decaying rates. The bolometric light curve of SN 2020ank exhibits a higher peak luminosity (L<SUB>max</SUB>) of ∼ (3.9 ± 0.7) × 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> and appears to be symmetric around the peak with $L^{\mathrm{ rise}}_{\mathrm{ max}}$ /e ${\approx}L^{\mathrm{ fall}}_{\mathrm{ max}}$ /e ≈ 15 d. The semi-analytical light-curve modelling using the minim code suggests a spin-down millisecond magnetar with $P_i\, \sim$ 2.2 ± 0.5 ms and $B\, \sim$ (2.9 ± 0.1) $\times \, 10^{14}$ G as a possible powering source for SN 2020ank. The possible magnetar origin and excess ultraviolet flux at early epochs indicate a central-engine based powering source for SN 2020ank. Near-peak spectra of SN 2020ank are enriched with the W-shaped O II features but with the weaker signatures of C II and Fe III. Using the estimated rise time of ∼ 27.9 d and the photospheric velocity of ∼ 12 050 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, we constrain the ejecta mass to ∼ 7.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and the kinetic energy of ∼6.3 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg. The near-peak spectrum of SN 2020ank exhibits a close spectral resemblance with that of fast-evolving SN 2010gx. The absorption features of SN 2020ank are blueshifted compared to Gaia16apd, suggesting a higher expansion velocity. The spectral similarity with SN 2010gx and comparatively faster spectral evolution than PTF12dam (a slow-evolving SLSN) indicate the fast-evolving behaviour of SN 2020ank.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.1678K
Improved early warning of compact binary mergers using higher modes of gravitational radiation: a population study;;A gravitational wave early warning of a compact binary coalescence event, with a sufficiently tight localization skymap, would allow telescopes to point in the direction of the potential electromagnetic counterpart before its onset. Use of higher modes of gravitational radiation, in addition to the dominant mode typically used in templated real-time searches, was recently shown to produce significant improvements in early-warning times and skyarea localizations for a range of asymmetric mass binaries. We perform a large-scale study to assess the benefits of this method for a population of compact binary merger observations. In particular, we inject 100 000 such signals in Gaussian noise, with component masses $m_1 \in \left[1, 60 \right] \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$ and $m_2 \in \left[1, 3 \right] \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$ . We consider three scenarios involving ground-based detectors: the fifth (O5) observing run of the Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network, its projected Voyager upgrade, as well as a proposed third-generation (3G) network. We find that for fixed early-warning times of 20-60 s, the inclusion of the higher modes can provide localization improvements of a factor of ≳2 for up to ${\sim}60{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ ( $70 {{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ ) of the neutron star-black hole (NSBH) systems in the O5 (Voyager) scenario. Considering only those NSBH systems that can produce potential electromagnetic counterparts, such improvements in the localization can be expected for ${\sim}5\!-\!35{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ $(20\!-\!50{{\ \rm per\ cent}})$ binaries in O5 (Voyager). For the 3G scenario, a significant fraction of the events have time gains of a minute to several minutes, assuming fiducial target localization areas of 100-1000 deg<SUP>2</SUP>.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.1612S
Simulations of Torus Reverberation Mapping Experiments with SPHEREx;;Reverberation mapping (RM) is an efficient method to investigate the physical sizes of the broad line region (BLR) and dusty torus in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) mission will provide multi-epoch spectroscopic data at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. These data can be used for RM experiments with bright AGNs. We present results of a feasibility test using SPHEREx data in the SPHEREx deep regions for torus RM measurements. We investigate the physical properties of bright AGNs in the SPHEREx deep field. Based on this information, we compute the efficiency of detecting torus time lags in simulated light curves. We demonstrate that, in combination with complementary optical data with a depth of ∼20 mag in B-band, lags of ≤ 750 days for tori can be measured for more than ∼200 bright AGNs. If high signal-to-noise ratio photometric data with a depth of ∼21-22 mag are available, RM measurements are possible for up to ∼900 objects. When complemented by well-designed early optical observations, SPHEREx can provide a unique dataset for studies of the physical properties of dusty tori in bright AGNs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JKAS...54...37K
Changes in the Period of SU Sct, a Population II Cepheid;;The reduction of all the available photometry for the Cepheid SU Sct has allowed its $O-C$ diagram spanning a time interval of 60 years to be constructed. Six abrupt changes in the period have been detected. The pulsation stability test proposed by Lombard and Koen (1993) has confirmed that the changes in the period are real. The absolute magnitude of SU Sct is $M<SUB>V</SUB>∼eq{-}0\overset{\textrm{m}}{.}32$, confirming that it belongs to BL Her-type Population II Cepheids.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AstL...47..252B
Chromospheric Activity of Periodic Variable Stars Based on the LAMOST Low- and Medium-resolution Spectral Survey;;We present a catalog of 75,867 periodic variable stars from data release 7 of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope. We calculated the chromospheric activity index, equivalent widths for 201,349 spectra, and excess fractional luminosity ( ${R}_{{\rm{H}}\alpha }^{{\prime} }$ ) for 130,796 spectra. Based on the intensity of the Hα line, we detected 30,719 F-, G-, and K-type variable stars with Hα fill-in or emission and 2521 M-type variable stars exhibiting Hα emission. Furthermore, 14,938 out of 30,573 periodic variable stars showed Hα variability. Analysis of samples with different spectral types confirmed that the activity fraction of stars with later spectral type clearly decreases as the absolute Galactic height increases away from the Galactic plane. The results also show that at the same absolute Galactic height, the activity fractions in eclipsing binaries are higher than those in single stars. In this study, we present the activity-rotation relations for F-, G-, K-, and M-type variable stars. The results of analysis show that rapid rotators keep a saturated value, and the absolute value of the power-law index exhibits an increasing trend from F- to K-type stars in the unsaturated regime. Moreover, we confirm that the angular momentum and magnetic momentum are positively correlated, which indicates that the α-ω dynamo may be working. In addition, we confirmed the correlations among the Hα, Hβ, Hγ, Hδ, Ca II H&K, and Ca II infrared triplet lines.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..253...51L
Time-series and Phase-curve Photometry of the Episodically Active Asteroid (6478) Gault in a Quiescent State Using APO, GROWTH, P200, and ZTF;;We observed the episodically active asteroid (6478) Gault in 2020 with multiple telescopes in Asia and North America and found that it is no longer active after its recent outbursts at the end of 2018 and the start of 2019. The inactivity during this apparition allowed us to measure the absolute magnitude of Gault of H<SUB>r</SUB> = 14.63 ± 0.02, G<SUB>r</SUB> = 0.21 ± 0.02 from our secular phase-curve observations. In addition, we were able to constrain Gault's rotation period using time-series photometric lightcurves taken over 17 hr on multiple days in 2020 August, September, and October. The photometric lightcurves have a repeating ≲0.05 mag feature suggesting that (6478) Gault has a rotation period of ∼2.5 hr and may have a semispherical or top-like shape, much like the near-Earth asteroids Ryugu and Bennu. The rotation period of ∼2.5 hr is near the expected critical rotation period for an asteroid with the physical properties of (6478) Gault, suggesting that its activity observed over multiple epochs is due to surface mass shedding from its fast rotation spin-up by the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack effect.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...911L..35P
Gaia EDR3 Parallax Zero-point Offset Based on W Ursae Majoris-type Eclipsing Binaries;;We independently determine the zero-point offset of the Gaia early Data Release-3 (EDR3) parallaxes based on ∼110,000 W Ursae Majoris (EW)-type eclipsing binary systems. EWs cover almost the entire sky and are characterized by a relatively complete coverage in magnitude and color. They are an excellent proxy for Galactic main-sequence stars. We derive a W1-band period-luminosity relation with a distance accuracy of 7.4%, which we use to anchor the Gaia parallax zero-point. The final, global parallax offsets are -28.6 ± 0.6 μas and -25.4 ± 4.0 μas (before correction) and 4.2 ± 0.5 μas and 4.6 ± 3.7 μas (after correction) for the five- and six-parameter solutions, respectively. The total systematic uncertainty is 1.8 μas. The spatial distribution of the parallax offsets shows that the bias in the corrected Gaia EDR3 parallaxes is less than 10 μas across 40% of the sky. Only 15% of the sky is characterized by a parallax offset greater than 30 μas. Thus, we have provided independent evidence that the parallax zero-point correction provided by the Gaia team significantly reduces the prevailing bias. Combined with literature data, we find that the overall Gaia EDR3 parallax offsets for Galactic stars are [-20, -30] μas and 4-10 μas, respectively, before and after correction. For specific regions, an additional deviation of about 10 μas is found.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...911L..20R
Accretion-modified Stars in Accretion Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei: Slowly Transient Appearance;;Compact objects are expected to exist in the accretion disks of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and in the presence of such a dense environment (∼10<SUP>14</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>), they will form a new kind of stellar population denoted as accretion-modified stars (AMSs). This hypothesis is supported by recent LIGO/Virgo detection of the mergers of very high-mass stellar binary black holes (BHs). We show that the AMSs will be trapped by the SMBH disk within a typical AGN lifetime. In the context of SMBH disks, the rates of Bondi accretion onto BHs are ∼10<SUP>9</SUP>L<SUB>Edd</SUB>/c<SUP>2</SUP>, where L<SUB>Edd</SUB> is the Eddington luminosity and c is the speed of light. Outflows developed from the hyper-Eddington accretion strongly impact the Bondi sphere and induce episodic accretion. We show that the hyper-Eddington accretion will be halted after an accretion interval of t<SUB>a</SUB> ∼ 10<SUP>5</SUP>m<SUB>1</SUB> s, where m<SUB>1</SUB> = m<SUB>•</SUB>/10M<SUB>⊙</SUB> is the BH mass. The kinetic energy of the outflows accumulated during t<SUB>a</SUB> is equivalent to 10 supernovae driving an explosion of the Bondi sphere and developing blast waves. We demonstrate that a synchrotron flare from relativistic electrons accelerated by the blast waves peaks in the soft X-ray band (∼0.1 keV), significantly contributing to the radio, optical, UV, and soft X-ray emission of typical radio-quiet quasars. External inverse Compton scattering of the electrons peaks around 40 GeV and is detectable through Fermi-LAT. The flare, decaying with t<SUP>-6/5</SUP> with a few months, will appear as a slowly varying transient. The flares, occurring at a rate of a few per year in radio-quiet quasars, provide a new mechanism for explaining AGN variability.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...911L..14W
Magnetar-driven Shock Breakout Revisited and Implications for Double-peaked Type I Superluminous Supernovae;;The discovery of early bumps in some type-I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) before the main peaks offers an important clue to their energy source mechanisms. In this paper, we updated an analytic magnetar-powered model for fitting the multiband light curves of double-peaked SLSNe-I. The early bump is powered by magnetar-driven shock-breakout thermal emission, and the main peak is powered by a radiative diffusion through the supernova (SN) ejecta as in the standard magnetar-powered model. Generally, the diffusive luminosity is greater than the shock-breakout luminosity at the early time, which usually makes the shock-breakout bumps unclear to observe. To obtain a clear double-peaked light curve, inefficient magnetar heating at early times is required. This model is applied to three well-observed double-peaked SLSNe-I (i.e., SN2006oz, LSQ14bdq, and DES14Xtaz). We find that a relatively massive SN ejecta with M<SUB>ej</SUB> ≃ 10.2-18.1M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and relatively large kinetic energy of SN ejecta ${E}_{\mathrm{sn}}\simeq (3.8\mbox{--}6.5)\times {10}^{51}$ erg are required, and the thermalization efficiency of the magnetar heating is suppressed before t<SUB>delay</SUB>, which is in the range of ≃15-43 days. The model can reproduce the observed light curves well, with a reasonable and similar set of physical parameters for both the early bump and the main peak, strengthening support for the magnetar-powered model. In the future, modeling of the double-peaked SLSNe-I will become more feasible as more events are discovered before the early bump.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...911..142L
Fast Optical Transients from Stellar-mass Black Hole Tidal Disruption Events in Young Star Clusters;;Observational evidence suggests that the majority of stars may have been born in stellar clusters or associations. Within these dense environments, dynamical interactions lead to high rates of close stellar encounters. A variety of recent observational and theoretical indications suggest stellar-mass black holes may be present and play an active dynamical role in stellar clusters of all masses. In this study, we explore the tidal disruption of main-sequence stars by stellar-mass black holes in young star clusters. We compute a suite of over 3000 independent N-body simulations that cover a range of cluster mass, metallicity, and half-mass radii. We find stellar-mass black hole tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur at an overall rate of up to roughly 200 Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> in young stellar clusters in the local universe. These TDEs are expected to have several characteristic features, namely, fast rise times of order a day, peak X-ray luminosities of at least 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, and bright optical luminosities (roughly 10<SUP>41</SUP>-10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) associated with reprocessing by a disk wind. In particular, we show these events share many features in common with the emerging class of Fast Blue Optical Transients.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...911..104K
HO Puppis: Not a Be Star, but a Newly Confirmed IW And-type Star;;HO Puppis (HO Pup) was considered as a Be-star candidate based on its γ Cassiopeiae-type light curve, but lacked spectroscopic confirmation. Using distance measured from Gaia Data Release 2 and the spectral-energy-distribution fit on broadband photometry, the Be-star nature of HO Pup is ruled out. Furthermore, based on the 28,700 photometric data points collected from various time-domain surveys and dedicated intensive-monitoring observations, the light curves of HO Pup closely resemble those of IW And-type stars (as pointed out by Kimura et al.), exhibiting characteristics such as a quasi-standstill phase, brightening, and dips. The light curve of HO Pup displays various variability timescales, including brightening cycles ranging from 23 to 61 days, variations with periods between 3.9 days and 50 minutes during the quasi-standstill phase, and a semiregular ∼14 day period for the dip events. We have also collected time-series spectra (with various spectral resolutions), in which Balmer emission lines and other spectral lines expected for an IW And-type star were detected (even though some of these lines were also expected to be present for Be stars). We detect Bowen fluorescence near the brightening phase, and that can be used to discriminate between IW And-type stars and Be stars. Finally, despite only observing for four nights, the polarization variation was detected, indicating that HO Pup has significant intrinsic polarization.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...911...51L
GRB 191016A: A Long Gamma-Ray Burst Detected by TESS;;The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) exoplanet-hunting mission detected the rising and decaying optical afterglow of GRB 191016A, a long gamma-ray burst (GRB) detected by Swift-BAT but without prompt XRT or UVOT follow-up due to proximity to the Moon. The afterglow has a late peak at least 1000 s after the BAT trigger, with a brightest-detected TESS data point at 2589.7 s post-trigger. The burst was not detected by Fermi-LAT, but was detected by Fermi-GBM without triggering, possibly due to the gradual nature of the rising light curve. Using ground-based photometry, we estimate a photometric redshift of z<SUB>phot</SUB> = 3.29 ± 0.40. Combined with the high-energy emission and optical peak time derived from TESS, estimates of the bulk Lorentz factor Γ<SUB>BL</SUB> range from 90 to 133. The burst is relatively bright, with a peak optical magnitude in ground-based follow-up of R = 15.1 mag. Using published distributions of GRB afterglows and considering the TESS sensitivity and sampling, we estimate that TESS is likely to detect ∼1 GRB afterglow per year above its magnitude limit.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...911...43S
Infrared Echoes of Optical Tidal Disruption Events: ∼1% Dust-covering Factor or Less at Subparsec Scale;;The past decade has experienced an explosive increase of optically discovered tidal disruption events (TDEs) with the advent of modern time-domain surveys. However, we still lack a comprehensive observational view of their infrared (IR) echoes in spite of individual detections. To this end, we have conducted a statistical study of the IR variability of the 23 optical TDEs discovered between 2009 and 2018 using the full public data set of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. The detection of variability is performed on the difference images, yielding 11 objects with significant (>3σ) variability in at least one band, while dust emission can be only fit in 8 objects. Their peak dust luminosity is around 10<SUP>41</SUP>-10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, corresponding to a dust-covering factor f<SUB>c</SUB> ∼ 0.01 at a subparsec scale. The only exception is the disputed source ASASSN-15lh, which shows an ultra-high dust luminosity (∼10<SUP>43.5</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>), and this makes its nature even more elusive. Other nondetected objects show even lower f<SUB>c</SUB>, which could be lower by one more order of magnitude. The derived f<SUB>c</SUB> is generally much lower than those of dusty tori in active galactic nuclei, suggesting either a dearth of dust or a geometrically thin and flat disk in the vicinity of supermassive black holes. Our results also indicate that the optical TDE sample (post-starburst galaxies overrepresented) is seriously biased to events with little dust at subparsec scale, while TDEs in dusty star-forming systems could be more efficiently unveiled by IR echoes.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...911...31J
Census of R Coronae Borealis Stars. I. Infrared Light Curves from Palomar Gattini IR;;We are undertaking the first systematic infrared (IR) census of R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars in the Milky Way, beginning with IR light curves from the Palomar Gattini IR (PGIR) survey. The PGIR is a 30 cm J-band telescope with a 25 deg<SUP>2</SUP> camera that is surveying 18,000 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of the northern sky (δ > -28°) at a cadence of 2 days. We present PGIR light curves for 922 RCB candidates selected from a mid-IR color-based catalog. Of these 922, 149 are promising RCB candidates, as they show pulsations or declines similar to RCB stars. The majority of the candidates that are not RCB stars are either long-period variables (LPVs) or RV Tauri stars. We identify IR color-based criteria to better distinguish between RCB stars and LPVs. As part of a pilot spectroscopic run, we obtain NIR spectra for 26 of the 149 promising candidates and spectroscopically confirm 11 new RCB stars. We detect strong He I λ10830 features in the spectra of all RCB stars, likely originating within high-velocity (200-400 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) winds in their atmospheres. Nine of these RCB stars show <SUP>12</SUP>C<SUP>16</SUP>O and <SUP>12</SUP>C<SUP>18</SUP>O molecular absorption features, suggesting that they are formed through a white dwarf merger. We detect quasiperiodic pulsations in the light curves of five RCB stars. The periods range between 30 and 125 days and likely originate from the strange-mode instability in these stars. Our pilot run results motivate a dedicated IR spectroscopic campaign to classify all RCB candidates.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...910..132K
Forward Modeling Populations of Flares from Tidal Disruptions of Stars by Supermassive Black Holes;;Detections of the tidal disruption flares (TDFs) of stars by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are rapidly accumulating as optical surveys improve. These detections may provide constraints on SMBH demographics, stellar dynamics, and stellar evolution in galaxies. To maximize this scientific impact, we require a better understanding of how astrophysical parameters interact with survey selection effects in setting the properties of detected flares. We develop a framework for modeling the distributions of optical TDF detections in surveys across attributes of the host galaxies and the flares themselves. This model folds in effects of the stellar disruption rate in each galaxy, the flare luminosity and temperature distributions, the effects of obscuration and reddening by dust in the host galaxy, and survey selection criteria. We directly apply this model to the sample of TDFs detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility, and find that the overall flare detection rate is in line with simple theoretical expectation. The model can also reproduce the distribution of total stellar mass and redshift of the host galaxies, but fails to match all details of the detected flares, such as their luminosity and temperature distributions. We also find that dust obscuration likely plays an important role in suppressing the TDF detection rate in star-forming galaxies. While we do not find that the unusual preference of TDFs to have hosts in post-starburst galaxies in the "green valley" can be entirely explained by selection effects, our model can help to quantify the true rate enhancement in those galaxies.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...910...93R
A Swift Fix for Nuclear Outbursts;;In November 2020, the Swift team announced an update to the UltraViolet and Optical Telescope calibration to correct for the loss of sensitivity over time. This correction affects observations in the three near-ultraviolet (UV) filters, by up to 0.3 mag in some cases. As UV photometry is critical to characterizing tidal disruption events (TDEs) and other peculiar nuclear outbursts, we recomputed published Swift data for TDEs and other singular nuclear outbursts with Swift photometry in 2015 or later as a service to the community. Using archival UV, optical, and infrared photometry, we ran host SED fits for each host galaxy. From these, we computed synthetic host magnitudes and host-galaxy properties. We calculated host-subtracted magnitudes for each transient and computed blackbody fits. In addition to the nuclear outbursts, we include the ambiguous transient ATLAS18qqn (AT2018cow), which has been classified as a potential TDE on an intermediate-mass black hole. Finally, with updated bolometric light curves, we recover the relationship of Hinkle et al., where more-luminous TDEs decay more slowly than less-luminous TDEs, with decreased scatter compared to the original relationship.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...910...83H
Second Data Release of the All-sky NOIRLab Source Catalog;;We announce the second data release (DR2) of the NOIRLab Source Catalog (NSC), using 412,116 public images from CTIO-4 m+DECam, the KPNO-4 m+Mosaic3, and the Bok-2.3 m+90Prime. NSC DR2 contains over 3.9 billion unique objects, 68 billion individual source measurements, covers ≈35,000 square degrees of the sky, has depths of ≈23 mag in most broadband filters with ≈1%-2% photometric precision, and astrometric accuracy of ≈7 mas. Approximately 1.9 billion objects within ≈30,000 square degrees of sky have photometry in three or more bands. There are several improvements over NSC DR1. DR2 includes 156,662 (61%) more exposures extending over 2 more years than in DR1. The southern photometric zero-points in griz are more accurate by using the Skymapper DR1 and ATLAS-Ref2 catalogs, and improved extinction corrections were used for high-extinction regions. In addition, the astrometric accuracy is improved by taking advantage of Gaia DR2 proper motions when calibrating the astrometry of individual images. This improves the NSC proper motions to ∼2.5 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP> (precision) and ∼0.2 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP> (accuracy). The combination of sources into unique objects is performed using a DBSCAN algorithm and mean parameters per object (such as mean magnitudes, proper motion, etc.) are calculated more robustly with outlier rejection. Finally, eight multi-band photometric variability indices are calculated for each object and variable objects are flagged (23 million objects). NSC DR2 will be useful for exploring solar system objects, stellar streams, dwarf satellite galaxies, quasi-stellar objects, variable stars, high proper-motion stars, and transients. Several examples of these science use cases are presented. The NSC DR2 catalog is publicly available via the NOIRLab's Astro Data Lab science platform.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....161..192N
On the Classification and Feature Relevance of Multiband Light Curves;;With an expected torrent of data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), the need for automated identification of noisy and sparse light curves will increase drastically. In this paper, we performed classification of multiband astronomical light curves from the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) data set via boosted neural nets, boosted decision trees, and a voted classifier for 14 astronomical categories. In order to deal with noisy features, we used wavelet decomposition together with feature selection. We also performed a feature ranking method using a neural network. Our method may be considered an alternative to random forests, which is known to favor features with more categories as relevant. We also investigated the class importance with neural nets using a one-versus-all approach which reduces the multiclass problem to a binary class problem.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....161..168E
Photometric data-driven classification of Type Ia supernovae in the open Supernova Catalog;;We propose a novel approach for a machine-learning-based detection of the type Ia supernovae using photometric information. Unlike other approaches, only real observation data is used during training. Despite being trained on a relatively small sample, the method shows good results on real data from the Open Supernovae Catalog. We also investigate model transfer from the PLAsTiCC simulations train dataset to real data application, and the reverse, and find the performance significantly decreases in both cases, highlighting the existing differences between simulated and real data.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&C....3500451D
Machine learning technique for morphological classification of galaxies from the SDSS. I. Photometry-based approach;;Context. Machine learning methods are effective tools in astronomical tasks for classifying objects by their individual features. One of the promising utilities is related to the morphological classification of galaxies at different redshifts. 
 Aims: We use the photometry-based approach for the SDSS data (1) to exploit five supervised machine learning techniques and define the most effective among them for the automated galaxy morphological classification; (2) to test the influence of photometry data on morphology classification; (3) to discuss problem points of supervised machine learning and labeling bias; and (4) to apply the best fitting machine learning methods for revealing the unknown morphological types of galaxies from the SDSS DR9 at z < 0.1. 
 Methods: We used different galaxy classification techniques: human labeling, multi-photometry diagrams, naive Bayes, logistic regression, support-vector machine, random forest, k-nearest neighbors. 
 Results: We present the results of a binary automated morphological classification of galaxies conducted by human labeling, multi-photometry, and five supervised machine learning methods. We applied it to the sample of galaxies from the SDSS DR9 with redshifts of 0.02 < z < 0.1 and absolute stellar magnitudes of −24<SUP>m</SUP> < M<SUB>r</SUB> < −19.4<SUP>m</SUP>. For the analysis we used absolute magnitudes M<SUB>u</SUB>, M<SUB>g</SUB>, M<SUB>r</SUB>, M<SUB>i</SUB>, M<SUB>z</SUB>; color indices M<SUB>u</SUB> − M<SUB>r</SUB>, M<SUB>g</SUB> − M<SUB>i</SUB>, M<SUB>u</SUB> − M<SUB>g</SUB>, M<SUB>r</SUB> − M<SUB>z</SUB>; and the inverse concentration index to the center R50/R90. We determined the ability of each method to predict the morphological type, and verified various dependencies of the method's accuracy on redshifts, human labeling, morphological shape, and overlap of different morphological types for galaxies with the same color indices. We find that the morphology based on the supervised machine learning methods trained over photometric parameters demonstrates significantly less bias than the morphology based on citizen-science classifiers. 
 Conclusions: The support-vector machine and random forest methods with Scikit-learn software machine learning library in Python provide the highest accuracy for the binary galaxy morphological classification. Specifically, the success rate is 96.4% for support-vector machine (96.1% early E and 96.9% late L types) and 95.5% for random forest (96.7% early E and 92.8% late L types). Applying the support-vector machine for the sample of 316 031 galaxies from the SDSS DR9 at z < 0.1 with unknown morphological types, we found 139 659 E and 176 372 L types among them.

Large-amplitude variables in Gaia Data Release 2. Multi-band variability characterization;;Context. Photometric variability is an essential feature that sheds light on the intrinsic properties of celestial variable sources, the more so when photometry is available in various bands. In this respect, the all-sky Gaia mission is particularly attractive as it collects, among other quantities, epoch photometry measured quasi-simultaneously in three optical bands for sources ranging from a few magnitudes to fainter than magnitude 20. 
 Aims: The second data release (DR2) of the mission provides mean G, G<SUB>BP</SUB>, and G<SUB>RP</SUB> photometry for ∼1.4 billion sources, but light curves and variability properties are available for only ∼0.5 million of them. Here, we provide a census of large-amplitude variables (LAVs) with amplitudes larger than ∼0.2 mag in the G band for objects with mean brightnesses between 5.5 and 19 mag. 
 Methods: To achieve this, we rely on variability amplitude proxies in G, G<SUB>BP</SUB>, and G<SUB>RP</SUB> computed from the uncertainties on the magnitudes published in DR2. We then apply successive filters to identify two subsets containing sources with reliable mean G<SUB>BP</SUB> and G<SUB>RP</SUB> (for studies using colours) and sources having compatible amplitude proxies in G, G<SUB>BP</SUB>, and G<SUB>RP</SUB> (for multi-band variability studies). 
 Results: The full catalogue gathers 23 315 874 LAV candidates, and the two subsets with increased levels of purity contain, respectively, 1 148 861 and 618 966 sources. A multi-band variability analysis of the catalogue shows that different types of variable stars can be categorized according to their colours and blue-to-red amplitude ratios as determined from the G, G<SUB>BP</SUB>, and G<SUB>RP</SUB> amplitude proxies. More specifically, four groups are globally identified. They include: long-period variables in a first group with amplitudes more than twice larger in the blue than in the red; hot compact variables in a second group with amplitudes smaller in the blue than in the red; classical instability strip pulsators in a third group with amplitudes larger in the blue than in the red by 50% to 80%; and other non-pulsating variables in a fourth group, mainly achromatic, but 10% of them still having 20% to 50% larger amplitudes in the blue than in the red. 
 Conclusions: The catalogue constitutes the first census of Gaia LAV candidates extracted from the public DR2 archive. The overview presented here illustrates the added value of the mission for multi-band variability studies, even at this stage when epoch photometry is not yet available for all sources.

Multiwavelength Observations of Fast Radio Bursts;;The origin and phenomenology of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) remains unknown despite more than a decade of efforts. Though several models have been proposed to explain the observed data, none is able to explain alone the variety of events so far recorded. The leading models consider magnetars as potential FRB sources. The recent detection of FRBs from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 seems to support them. Still, emission duration and energetic budget challenge all these models. Like for other classes of objects initially detected in a single band, it appeared clear that any solution to the FRB enigma could only come from a coordinated observational and theoretical effort in an as wide as possible energy band. In particular, the detection and localisation of optical/NIR or/and high-energy counterparts seemed an unavoidable starting point that could shed light on the FRB physics. Multiwavelength (MWL) search campaigns were conducted for several FRBs, in particular for repeaters. Here we summarize the observational and theoretical results and the perspectives in view of the several new sources accurately localised that will likely be identified by various radio facilities worldwide. We conclude that more dedicated MWL campaigns sensitive to the millisecond--minute timescale transients are needed to address the various aspects involved in the identification of FRB counterparts. Dedicated instrumentation could be one of the key points in this respect. In the optical/NIR band, fast photometry looks to be the only viable strategy. Additionally, small/medium size radiotelescopes co-pointing higher energies telescopes look a very interesting and cheap complementary observational strategy.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021Univ....7...76N
Discovery of the First Interstellar Comet and the Spatial Density of Interstellar Objects in the Solar Neighborhood;;The discovery of the first interstellar comet 2I/Borisov confirmed the astronomers' speculation that the passage through the solar system of relatively large objects (asteroids and comets) formed outside of it is a common occurrence. There may be many such objects, but their discovery is still a rare case. Large professional telescopes and existing observation programs with these telescopes have limitations that can be overcome with more modest instruments. The paper describes for the first time how comet 2I/Borisov was discovered with the 65-cm telescope designed by G.V. Borisov and those features of the observation program that made it possible to make this discovery. Recommendations are given for constructing future programs for detecting such bodies. The spatial density of interstellar objects (such as asteroid 1I/'Oumuamua or comet 2I/Borisov) in the solar neighborhood has been estimated. According to our estimate, there may be about 50 interstellar bodies >50 m in size in the Solar System in a sphere with a radius of 50 AU at any given time. Since the speeds of possible approach to the Earth of such objects can be very high, such probable approaches require special attention. The use of special space projects for their study is discussed.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021SoSyR..55..124B
Detectable Environmental Effects in GW190521-like Black-Hole Binaries with LISA;;GW190521 is the compact binary with the largest masses observed to date, with at least one black hole in the pair-instability gap. This event has also been claimed to be associated with an optical flare observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility in an active galactic nucleus (AGN), possibly due to the postmerger motion of the merger remnant in the AGN gaseous disk. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) may detect up to ten such gas-rich black-hole binaries months to years before their detection by Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory or Virgo-like interferometers, localizing them in the sky within ≈1 °<SUP>2</SUP> . LISA will also measure directly deviations from purely vacuum and stationary waveforms arising from gas accretion, dynamical friction, and orbital motion around the AGN's massive black hole (acceleration, strong lensing, and Doppler modulation). LISA will therefore be crucial to enable us to point electromagnetic telescopes ahead of time toward this novel class of gas-rich sources, to gain direct insight on their physics, and to disentangle environmental effects from corrections to general relativity that may also appear in the waveforms at low frequencies.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PhRvL.126j1105T
SNEWS 2.0: a next-generation supernova early warning system for multi-messenger astronomy;;The next core-collapse supernova in the Milky Way or its satellites will represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity to obtain detailed information about the explosion of a star and provide significant scientific insight for a variety of fields because of the extreme conditions found within. Supernovae in our galaxy are not only rare on a human timescale but also happen at unscheduled times, so it is crucial to be ready and use all available instruments to capture all possible information from the event. The first indication of a potential stellar explosion will be the arrival of a bright burst of neutrinos. Its observation by multiple detectors worldwide can provide an early warning for the subsequent electromagnetic fireworks, as well as signal to other detectors with significant backgrounds so they can store their recent data. The supernova early warning system (SNEWS) has been operating as a simple coincidence between neutrino experiments in automated mode since 2005. In the current era of multi-messenger astronomy there are new opportunities for SNEWS to optimize sensitivity to science from the next galactic supernova beyond the simple early alert. This document is the product of a workshop in June 2019 towards design of SNEWS 2.0, an upgraded SNEWS with enhanced capabilities exploiting the unique advantages of prompt neutrino detection to maximize the science gained from such a valuable event.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NJPh...23c1201A
SuperWASP variable stars: classifying light curves using citizen science;;We present the first analysis of results from the SuperWASP variable stars Zooniverse project, which is aiming to classify 1.6 million phase-folded light curves of candidate stellar variables observed by the SuperWASP all sky survey with periods detected in the SuperWASP periodicity catalogue. The resultant data set currently contains >1 million classifications corresponding to >500 000 object-period combinations, provided by citizen-scientist volunteers. Volunteer-classified light curves have ~89 per cent accuracy for detached and semidetached eclipsing binaries, but only ~9 per cent accuracy for rotationally modulated variables, based on known objects. We demonstrate that this Zooniverse project will be valuable for both population studies of individual variable types and the identification of stellar variables for follow-up. We present preliminary findings on various unique and extreme variables in this analysis, including long-period contact binaries and binaries near the short-period cut-off, and we identify 301 previously unknown binaries and pulsators. We are now in the process of developing a web portal to enable other researchers to access the outputs of the SuperWASP variable stars project.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.1299T
Testing the general theory of relativity using gravitational wave propagation from dark standard sirens;;Alternative theories of gravity predict modifications in the propagation of gravitational waves (GW) through space-time. One of the smoking-gun predictions of such theories is the change in the GW luminosity distance to GW sources as a function of redshift relative to the electromagnetic (EM) luminosity distance expected from EM probes. We propose a multimessenger test of the theory of general relativity from the propagation of GWs by combining EM and GW observations to resolve these issues from GW sources without EM counterparts (which are also referred to as dark standard sirens). By using the relation between the geometric distances accessible from baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, and luminosity distance measurements from the GW sources, we can measure any deviation from the general theory of relativity via the GW sources of unknown redshift that will be detectable by networks of GW detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. Using this technique, the fiducial value of the frictional term can be measured to a precision $\Xi _0=0.98^{+0.04}_{-0.23}$ after marginalizing over redshift dependence, cosmological parameters, and GW bias parameters with ~3500 dark standard sirens of masses $30\, \rm M_\odot$ each distributed up to redshift z = 0.5. For a fixed redshift dependence, a value of $\Xi _0=0.99^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ can be measured with a similar number of dark sirens. Application of our methodology to the far more numerous dark standard sirens detectable with next-generation GW detectors, such as LISA, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will allow achievement of higher accuracy than possible from use of bright standard sirens.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.1136M
Spectroscopy of the first resolved strongly lensed Type Ia supernova iPTF16geu;;We report the results from spectroscopic observations of the multiple images of the strongly lensed Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), iPTF16geu, obtained with ground-based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). From a single epoch of slitless spectroscopy with HST, we resolve spectra of individual lensed supernova images for the first time. This allows us to perform an independent measurement of the time-delay between the two brightest images, Δt = 1.4 ± 5.0 d, which is consistent with the time-delay measured from the light curves. We also present measurements of narrow emission and absorption lines characterizing the interstellar medium in the SN Ia host galaxy at z = 0.4087, as well as in the foreground lensing galaxy at z = 0.2163. We detect strong Na ID absorption in the host galaxy, indicating that iPTF16geu belongs to a subclass of SNe Ia displaying 'anomalously' large Na ID column densities compared to dust extinction derived from light curves. For the lens galaxy, we refine the measurement of the velocity dispersion, σ = 129 ± 4 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which significantly constrains the lens model. We use ground-based spectroscopy, boosted by a factor ∼70 from lensing magnification, to study the properties of a high-z SN Ia with unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio. The spectral properties of the supernova, such as pseudo-Equivalent widths of several absorption features and velocities of the Si II-line, indicate that iPTF16geu is a normal SN Ia. We do not detect any significant deviations of the SN spectral energy distribution from microlensing of the SN photosphere by stars and compact objects in the lensing galaxy.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502..510J
New insights into time-series analysis IV: panchromatic and flux-independent period finding methods;;New time-series analysis tools are needed in disciplines as diverse as astronomy, economics, and meteorology. In particular, the increasing rate of data collection at multiple wavelengths requires new approaches able to handle these data. The panchromatic correlated indices $K^{(s)}_{(fi)}$ and $L^{(s)}_{(pfc)}$ are adapted to quantify the smoothness of a phased light-curve resulting in new period-finding methods applicable to single- and multiband data. Simulations and observational data are used to test our approach. The results were used to establish an analytical equation for the amplitude of the noise in the periodogram for different false alarm probability values, to determine the dependency on the signal-to-noise ratio, and to calculate the yield rate for the different methods. The proposed method has similar efficiency to that found for the string length period method. The effectiveness of the panchromatic and flux-independent period finding methods in single as well as multiple wavebands that share a fundamental frequency is also demonstrated in real and simulated data.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.4123F
FINK, a new generation of broker for the LSST community;;FINK is a broker designed to enable science with large time-domain alert streams such as the one from the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). It exhibits traditional astronomy broker features such as automatized ingestion, annotation, selection, and redistribution of promising alerts for transient science. It is also designed to go beyond traditional broker features by providing real-time transient classification that is continuously improved by using state-of-the-art deep learning and adaptive learning techniques. These evolving added values will enable more accurate scientific output from LSST photometric data for diverse science cases while also leading to a higher incidence of new discoveries which shall accompany the evolution of the survey. In this paper, we introduce FINK, its science motivation, architecture, and current status including first science verification cases using the Zwicky Transient Facility alert stream.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.3272M
Design and sensitivity of the Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G);;This article presents the design of the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland (RNO-G) and discusses its scientific prospects. Using an array of radio sensors, RNO-G seeks to measure neutrinos above 10 PeV by exploiting the Askaryan effect in neutrino-induced cascades in ice. We discuss the experimental considerations that drive the design of RNO-G, present first measurements of the hardware that is to be deployed and discuss the projected sensitivity of the instrument. RNO-G will be the first production-scale radio detector for in-ice neutrino signals.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JInst..16P3025A
The H.E.S.S. gravitational wave rapid follow-up program;;Gravitational Wave (GW) events are physical processes that significantly perturbate space-time, e.g. compact binary coalescenses, causing the production of GWs. The detection of GWs by a worldwide network of advanced interferometers offers unique opportunities for multi-messenger searches and electromagnetic counterpart associations. While carrying extremely useful information, searches for associated electromagnetic emission are challenging due to large sky localisation uncertainties provided by the current GW observatories LIGO and Virgo. Here we present the methods and procedures used within the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) in searches for very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission associated to the emission of GWs from extreme events. To do so we create several algorithms dedicated to schedule GW follow-up observations by creating optimized pointing paterns. We describe algorithms using 2-dimensional GW localisation information and algorithms correlating the galaxy distribution in the local universe, by using galaxy catalogs, with the 3-dimensional GW localisation information and evaluate their performances. The H.E.S.S. automatic GW follow-up chain, described in this paper, is optimized to initiate GW follow-up observations within less than 1 minute after the alert reception. These developements allowed H.E.S.S. observations of 6 GW events out of the 67 non-retracted GW events detected during the first three observation runs of LIGO and Virgo reaching VHE γ-ray coverages of up to 70% of the GW localisation.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JCAP...03..045A
Supermassive Black Holes with High Accretion Rates in Active Galactic Nuclei. XII. Reverberation Mapping Results for 15 PG Quasars from a Long-duration High-cadence Campaign;;In this work, we present the first results of the long-term high-cadence spectroscopic monitoring of 15 PG quasars with relatively strong Fe ii emission, as a part of a broader reverberation mapping campaign performed using the Calar Alto Observatory's 2.2 m telescope. The V-band, 5100 Å continuum, and Hβ broad emission line light curves are measured for a set of quasars for periods ranging from dozens to more than a hundred epochs between 2017 May and 2020 July. Accurate time lags between the variations of the Hβ broad-line fluxes and the optical continuum strength are obtained for all 15 quasars, ranging from ${17.0}_{-3.2}^{+2.5}$?--> 17.0 - 3.2 + 2.5 to ${95.9}_{-23.9}^{+7.1}$?--> 95.9 - 23.9 + 7.1 days in the rest frame. The virial masses of the central supermassive black holes are derived for all 15 quasars, ranging between ${0.50}_{-0.19}^{+0.18}$?--> 0.50 - 0.19 + 0.18 and ${19.17}_{-2.73}^{+2.98}$?--> 19.17 - 2.73 + 2.98 in units of 10<SUP>7</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. For 11 of the objects in our sample, this is the first reverberation analysis to be published. Of the rest, two objects have been the subject of previous reverberation studies, but we determine time lags for these that are only half as long as those found in the earlier investigations, which had only been able to sample much more sparsely. The remaining two objects have previously been monitored with high sampling rates. Our results here are consistent with the earlier findings, in the sense that the time lag and the line width vary inversely, consistent with virialization.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..253...20H
Be It Unresolved: Measuring Time Delays from Lensed Supernovae;;Gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) may be the next frontier in cosmic probes, able to deliver independent constraints on dark energy, spatial curvature, and the Hubble constant. Measurements of time delays between the multiple images become more incisive due to the standardized candle nature of the source, monitoring for months rather than years, and partial immunity to microlensing. While currently extremely rare, hundreds of such systems should be detected by upcoming time domain surveys. Others will have the images spatially unresolved, with the observed lightcurve a superposition of time-delayed image fluxes. We investigate whether unresolved images can be recognized as lensed sources given only lightcurve information, and whether time delays can be extracted robustly. We develop a method that we show can identify these systems for the case of lensed SNe Ia with two images and time delays exceeding ten days. When tested on such an ensemble, without microlensing, the method achieves a false-positive rate of ≲5%, and measures the time delays with a completeness of ≳93% and with a bias of ≲0.5% for Δt<SUB>fit</SUB> ≳ 10 days. Since the method does not assume a template of any particular type of SN, the method has the (untested) potential to work on other types of lensed SNe systems and possibly on other transients as well.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...910...65B
Lunar Gravitational-wave Antenna;;Monitoring of vibrational eigenmodes of an elastic body excited by gravitational waves was one of the first concepts proposed for the detection of gravitational waves. At laboratory scale, these experiments became known as resonant bar detectors first developed by Joseph Weber in the 1960s. Due to the dimensions of these bars, the targeted signal frequencies were in the kHz range. Weber also pointed out that monitoring of vibrations of Earth or the Moon could reveal gravitational waves in the mHz band. His Lunar Surface Gravimeter experiment deployed on the Moon by the Apollo 17 crew had a technical failure, which greatly reduced the science scope of the experiment. In this article, we revisit the idea and propose a Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA). We find that LGWA could become an important partner observatory for joint observations with the space-borne, laser-interferometric detector LISA and at the same time contribute an independent science case due to LGWA's unique features. Technical challenges need to be overcome for the deployment of the experiment, and development of inertial vibration sensor technology lays out a future path for this exciting detector concept.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...910....1H
Swift Follow-up Observations of Gravitational-wave and High-energy Neutrino Coincident Signals;;Electromagnetic observations of gravitational-wave and high-energy neutrino events are crucial in understanding the physics of their astrophysical sources. X-ray counterparts are especially useful in studying the physics of the jet, the energy of the outflow, and the particle acceleration mechanisms in the system. Ultraviolet and optical observations can help us constrain the mass and velocity of the outflow and provide hints on the viewing angle. We present the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory prompt searches for X-ray and UV/optical counterparts to the joint gravitational-wave and high-energy neutrino coincident events that happened during the third observing run of LIGO/Virgo. Swift observed the overlap between gravitational-wave and neutrino error regions for three of the considerable (p-value < 1%) joint gravitational-wave and high-energy neutrino coincident alerts, which were generated by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in real time after triggering by the LIGO/Virgo gravitational-wave public alerts. The searches did not associate any X-ray or UV/optical counterparts with any of the joint gravitational-wave and high-energy neutrino coincident events; however, the follow-up of these alerts significantly improved the tiling techniques covering regions between the gravitational-wave sky maps and the neutrino's error regions, making the real-time system ready for future potential discoveries. We discuss the details of each follow-up procedure, the results of each search, and the plans for future searches.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...909..126K
A Luminous X-Ray Transient in SDSS J143359.16+400636.0: A Likely Tidal Disruption Event;;We present the discovery of a luminous X-ray transient, serendipitously detected by Swift's X-ray Telescope on 2020 February 5, located in the nucleus of the galaxy SDSS J143359.16+400636.0 at z = 0.099 (luminosity distance D<SUB>L</SUB> = 456 Mpc). The transient was observed to reach a peak luminosity of ∼10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> in the 0.3-10 keV X-ray band, which was ∼20 times more than the peak optical/UV luminosity. Optical, UV, and X-ray light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility and Swift show a decline in flux from the source consistent with t<SUP>-5/3</SUP>, and observations with NuSTAR and Chandra show a soft X-ray spectrum with photon index Γ = 2.9 ± 0.1. The X-ray/UV properties are inconsistent with well-known active galactic nucleus properties and have more in common with known X-ray tidal disruption events (TDEs), leading us to conclude that it was likely a TDE. The broadband spectral energy distribution can be described well by a disk blackbody model with an inner disk temperature of ${7.3}_{-0.8}^{+0.3}\times {10}^{5}$ K, with a large fraction (>40%) of the disk emission upscattered into the X-ray band. An optical spectrum taken with Keck/LRIS after the X-ray detection reveals LINER line ratios in the host galaxy, suggesting low-level accretion onto the supermassive black hole prior to the event, but no broad lines or other indications of a TDE were seen. The stellar velocity dispersion implies that the mass of the supermassive black hole powering the event is log(M<SUB>BH</SUB>/M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) = 7.41 ± 0.41, and we estimate that at peak the Eddington fraction of this event was ∼50%. This likely TDE was not identified by wide-field optical surveys or optical spectroscopy, indicating that more events like this would be missed without wide-field UV or X-ray surveys.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...909..102B
Detection of Tidal Disruption Events around Direct-collapse Black Holes at High Redshifts with the James Webb Space Telescope;;This is the third sequel in a series discussing the discovery of various types of extragalactic transients with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in a narrow-field (∼0.1 deg<SUP>2</SUP>), moderately deep (m<SUB>AB</SUB> ∼ 27 mag) survey. In this part we focus on the detectability and observational characteristics of direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs) around them. We use existing models for DCBH accretion luminosities and spectra, as well as for TDE light curves, and find that accreting DCBH seeds may be bright enough for detection up to z ∼ 7 with JWST NIRCam imaging. TDEs of massive (M ≳ 50 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stars around them can enhance the chance for discovering them as transient objects, although the rate of such events is low, a few per survey time. TDEs around nonaccreting black holes of M ∼ 10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> may also be detected at z < 7 redshifts in the redder NIRCam bands between 3 and 5 μs. It is also shown that accreting DCBHs appear separate from supernovae on the NIRCam color-color plot, but TDEs from quiescent black holes fall in nearly the same color range as superluminous supernovae, which makes them more difficult to identify.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...909...64R
Correction to the Photometric Colors of the Gaia Data Release 2 with the Stellar Color Regression Method;;The second Gaia data release (DR2) delivers accurate and homogeneous photometry data of the whole sky of an exquisite quality, reaching down to the unprecedented millimagnitude (mmag) level for the G, G<SUB>RP</SUB>, and G<SUB>BP</SUB> passbands. However, the presence of magnitude-dependent systematic effects at the 10 mmag level limits its power in scientific exploitation. In this work, using about a half million stars in common with the LAMOST DR5, we apply the spectroscopy-based stellar color regression method to calibrate the Gaia G - G<SUB>RP</SUB> and G<SUB>BP</SUB> - G<SUB>RP</SUB> colors. With an unprecedented precision of about 1 mmag, systematic trends with G magnitude are revealed for both colors in great detail, reflecting changes in instrument configurations. Color-dependent trends are found for the G<SUB>BP</SUB> - G<SUB>RP</SUB> color and for stars brighter than G ∼ 11.5 mag. The maximum correction term of the calibration is about 20 mmag in general and varies by a few mmag/mag. A revised color-color diagram of Gaia DR2 is given, and some applications are briefly discussed.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...909...48N
Possible Evidence of Hydrogen Emission in the First-overtone and Multimode RR Lyrae Variables;;The nature of shock waves in nonfundamental mode RR Lyrae stars remains a mystery because of limited spectroscopic observations. We apply a pattern recognition algorithm on spectroscopic data from SDSS and LAMOST and report the first evidence of hydrogen emission in first-overtone (RRc) and multimode (RRd) RR Lyrae stars showing the "first apparition," which is the most prominent observational characteristic of shock in RR Lyrae variables. We find 10 RRc stars in SDSS, 10 RRc stars in LAMOST, and 3 RRd stars in LAMOST that show blueshifted Balmer emissions. The emission features possibly indicate the existence of shock waves. We calculate the radial velocities of the emission lines, which are related to the physical conditions occurring in the radiative zone of shock waves. Using photometric observations from ZTF, we present a detailed light-curve analysis for the frequency components in one of our RRd stars with hydrogen emission, RRdl3, for possible modulations. With the enormous volume of upcoming spectral observations of variable stars, our study raises the possibility of connecting the unexplained Blazhko effect to shock waves in nonfundamental mode RR Lyrae stars.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...909...25D
Photometric and Spectroscopic Investigations of the Galactic Field RRc Candidates V764 Mon and HY Com;;By analyzing photometric and spectroscopic time series, we show that the pulsator V764 Mon, assumed to be the brightest RR Lyr star in the sky, is in fact a rapidly rotating δ Sct star with an unusually long dominant period (P<SUB>1</SUB>=0.29 d). Our spectroscopy confirmed the binarity of V764 Mon discovered by the Gaia satellite. In the case of HY Com, a bona fide RRc star, we present its first complete radial velocity curve. Additionally, we found that the star continues its strong phase variation reported before.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AcA....71...55B
Alert Classification for the ALeRCE Broker System: The Light Curve Classifier;;We present the first version of the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE) broker light curve classifier. ALeRCE is currently processing the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream, in preparation for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. The ALeRCE light curve classifier uses variability features computed from the ZTF alert stream and colors obtained from AllWISE and ZTF photometry. We apply a balanced random forest algorithm with a two-level scheme where the top level classifies each source as periodic, stochastic, or transient, and the bottom level further resolves each of these hierarchical classes among 15 total classes. This classifier corresponds to the first attempt to classify multiple classes of stochastic variables (including core- and host-dominated active galactic nuclei, blazars, young stellar objects, and cataclysmic variables) in addition to different classes of periodic and transient sources, using real data. We created a labeled set using various public catalogs (such as the Catalina Surveys and Gaia DR2 variable stars catalogs, and the Million Quasars catalog), and we classify all objects with ≥6 g-band or ≥6 r-band detections in ZTF (868,371 sources as of 2020 June 9), providing updated classifications for sources with new alerts every day. For the top level we obtain macro-averaged precision and recall scores of 0.96 and 0.99, respectively, and for the bottom level we obtain macro-averaged precision and recall scores of 0.57 and 0.76, respectively. Updated classifications from the light curve classifier can be found at the ALeRCE Explorer website (http://alerce.online).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....161..141S
Initial Characterization of Active Transitioning Centaur, P/2019 LD<SUB>2</SUB> (ATLAS), Using Hubble, Spitzer, ZTF, Keck, Apache Point Observatory, and GROWTH Visible and Infrared Imaging and Spectroscopy;;We present visible and mid-infrared imagery and photometry of temporary Jovian co-orbital comet P/2019 LD<SUB>2</SUB> taken with Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3), Spitzer Space Telescope/Infrared Array Camera (Spitzer/IRAC), and the GROWTH telescope network, visible spectroscopy from Keck/Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS), and archival Zwicky Transient Facility observations taken between 2019 April and 2020 August. Our observations indicate that the nucleus of LD<SUB>2</SUB> has a radius between 0.2 and 1.8 km assuming a 0.08 albedo and a coma dominated by ∼100 μm-scale dust ejected at ∼1 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> speeds with a ∼1' jet pointing in the southwest direction. LD<SUB>2</SUB> experienced a total dust mass loss of ∼10<SUP>8</SUP> kg at a loss rate of ∼6 kg s<SUP>-1</SUP> with Afρ/cross section varying between ∼85 cm/125 km<SUP>2</SUP> and ∼200 cm/310 km<SUP>2</SUP> from 2019 April 9 to 2019 November 8. If the increase in Afρ/cross section remained constant, it implies LD<SUB>2</SUB>'s activity began ∼2018 November when within 4.8 au of the Sun, implying the onset of H<SUB>2</SUB>O sublimation. We measure CO/CO<SUB>2</SUB> gas production of ≲10<SUP>27</SUP> mol s<SUP>-1</SUP>/≲10<SUP>26</SUP> mol s<SUP>-1</SUP> from our 4.5 μm Spitzer observations; g-r = 0.59 ± 0.03, r-i = 0.18 ± 0.05, and i-z = 0.01 ± 0.07 from GROWTH observations; and H<SUB>2</SUB>O gas production of ≲80 kg s<SUP>-1</SUP> scaling from our estimated C<SUB>2</SUB> production of ${Q}_{{C}_{2}}\lesssim 7.5\times {10}^{24}$ mol s<SUP>-1</SUP> from Keck/LRIS spectroscopy. We determine that the long-term orbit of LD<SUB>2</SUB> is similar to Jupiter-family comets having close encounters with Jupiter within ∼0.5 Hill radius in the last ∼3 y and within 0.8 Hill radius in ∼9 y. Additionally, 78.8% of our orbital clones are ejected from the solar system within 1 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> yr, having a dynamical half-life of 3.4 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....161..116B
The ANTARES Astronomical Time-domain Event Broker;;We describe the Arizona-NOIRLab Temporal Analysis and Response to Events System (ANTARES), a software instrument designed to process large-scale streams of astronomical time-domain alerts. With the advent of large-format CCDs on wide-field imaging telescopes, time-domain surveys now routinely discover tens of thousands of new events each night, more than can be evaluated by astronomers alone. The ANTARES event broker will process alerts, annotating them with catalog associations and filtering them to distinguish customizable subsets of events. We describe the data model of the system, the overall architecture, annotation, implementation of filters, system outputs, provenance tracking, system performance, and the user interface.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....161..107M
Mysterious, variable, and extremely hot: White dwarfs showing ultra-high excitation lines. I. Photometric variability;;Context. About 10% of all stars exhibit absorption lines of ultra-highly excited (UHE) metals (e.g., O VIII) in their optical spectra when entering the white dwarf cooling sequence. This is something that has never been observed in any other astrophysical object, and poses a decades-long mystery in our understanding of the late stages of stellar evolution. The recent discovery of a UHE white dwarf that is both spectroscopically and photometrically variable led to the speculation that the UHE lines might be created in a shock-heated circumstellar magnetosphere. 
 Aims: We aim to gain a better understanding of these mysterious objects by studying the photometric variability of the whole population of UHE white dwarfs, and white dwarfs showing only the He II line problem, as both phenomena are believed to be connected. 
 Methods: We investigate (multi-band) light curves from several ground- and space-based surveys of all 16 currently known UHE white dwarfs (including one newly discovered) and eight white dwarfs that show only the He II line problem. 
 Results: We find that 75<SUB>−13</SUB><SUP>+8</SUP>% of the UHE white dwarfs, and 75<SUB>−19</SUB><SUP>+9</SUP>% of the He II line problem white dwarfs are significantly photometrically variable, with periods ranging from 0.22 d to 2.93 d and amplitudes from a few tenths to a few hundredths of a magnitude. The high variability rate is in stark contrast to the variability rate amongst normal hot white dwarfs (we find 9<SUB>−2</SUB><SUP>+4</SUP>%), marking UHE and He II line problem white dwarfs as a new class of variable stars. The period distribution of our sample agrees with both the orbital period distribution of post-common-envelope binaries and the rotational period distribution of magnetic white dwarfs if we assume that the objects in our sample will spin-up as a consequence of further contraction. 
 Conclusions: We find further evidence that UHE and He II line problem white dwarfs are indeed related, as concluded from their overlap in the Gaia HRD, similar photometric variability rates, light-curve shapes and amplitudes, and period distributions. The lack of increasing photometric amplitudes towards longer wavelengths, as well as the nondetection of optical emission lines arising from the highly irradiated face of a hypothetical secondary in the optical spectra of our stars, makes it seem unlikely that an irradiated late-type companion is the origin of the photometric variability. Instead, we believe that spots on the surfaces of these stars and/or geometrical effects of circumstellar material might be responsible.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...647A.184R
Forbidden hugs in pandemic times. II. The luminous red nova variety: AT 2020hat and AT 2020kog;;We present the results of our monitoring campaigns of the luminous red novae (LRNe) AT 2020hat in NGC 5068 and AT 2020kog in NGC 6106. The two objects were imaged (and detected) before their discovery by routine survey operations. They show a general trend of slow luminosity rise, lasting at least a few months. The subsequent major LRN outbursts were extensively followed in photometry and spectroscopy. The light curves present an initial short-duration peak, followed by a redder plateau phase. AT 2020kog is a moderately luminous event peaking at ∼7 × 10<SUP>40</SUP> erg s<SUP>−1</SUP>, while AT 2020hat is almost one order of magnitude fainter than AT 2020kog, although it is still more luminous than V838 Mon. In analogy with other LRNe, the spectra of AT 2020kog change significantly with time. They resemble those of type IIn supernovae at early phases, then they become similar to those of K-type stars during the plateau, and to M-type stars at very late phases. In contrast, AT 2020hat already shows a redder continuum at early epochs, and its spectrum shows the late appearance of molecular bands. A moderate-resolution spectrum of AT 2020hat taken at +37 d after maximum shows a forest of narrow P Cygni lines of metals with velocities of 180 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>, along with an Hα emission with a full-width at half-maximum velocity of 250 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>. For AT 2020hat, a robust constraint on its quiescent progenitor is provided by archival images of the Hubble Space Telescope. The progenitor is clearly detected as a mid-K type star, with an absolute magnitude of M<SUB>F606W</SUB> = −3.33 ± 0.09 mag and a colour of F606W − F814W = 1.14 ± 0.05 mag, which are inconsistent with the expectations from a massive star that could later produce a core-collapse supernova. Although quite peculiar, the two objects nicely match the progenitor versus light curve absolute magnitude correlations discussed in the literature.

AT 2019avd: a novel addition to the diverse population of nuclear transients;;We report on SRG/eROSITA, ZTF, ASAS-SN, Las Cumbres, NEOWISE-R, and Swift XRT/UVOT observations of the unique ongoing event AT 2019avd, located in the nucleus of a previously inactive galaxy at z = 0.029. eROSITA first observed AT 2019avd on 2020-04-28 during its first all sky survey, when it was detected as an ultra-soft X-ray source (kT ~ 85 eV) that was ≳90 times brighter in the 0.2-2 keV band than a previous 3σ upper flux detection limit (with no archival X-ray detection at this position). The ZTF optical light curve in the ~450 days preceding the eROSITA detection is double peaked, and the eROSITA detection coincides with the rise of the second peak. Follow-up optical spectroscopy shows the emergence of a Bowen fluorescence feature and high-ionisation coronal lines ([Fe X] 6375 Å, [Fe XIV] 5303 Å), along with persistent broad Balmer emission lines (FWHM ~ 1400 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). Whilst the X-ray properties make AT 2019avd a promising tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate, the optical properties are atypical for optically selected TDEs. We discuss potential alternative origins that could explain the observed properties of AT 2019avd, such as a stellar binary TDE candidate, or a TDE involving a super massive black hole binary.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...647A...9M
Zwicky Transient Facility Observations of Trojan Asteroids: A Thousand Colors, Rotation Amplitudes, and Phase Functions;;We introduce a new method for analyzing sparse photometric data of asteroids and apply it to Zwicky Transient Facility observations of the Jupiter Trojan asteroids. This method relies on the creation of a likelihood model that includes the probability distribution of rotational brightness variations at an unknown rotation phase. The likelihood model is analyzed via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo to quantify the uncertainty in our parameter estimates. Using this method, we provide color, phase parameter, absolute magnitude, and amplitude of rotation measurements for 1049 Jupiter Trojans. We find that phase parameter is correlated with color and the distribution of Trojan asteroid rotational amplitudes is indistinguishable from that of main-belt asteroids.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PSJ.....2...40S
Follow-up observations for IceCube-170922A: Detection of rapid near-infrared variability and intensive monitoring of TXS 0506+056;;We present our follow-up observations to search for an electromagnetic counterpart of the IceCube high-energy neutrino IceCube-170922A. Monitoring observations of a likely counterpart, TXS 0506+056, are also described. First, we quickly took optical and near-infrared images of seven flat-spectrum radio sources within the IceCube error region right after the neutrino detection and found a rapid flux decline of TXS 0506+056 in Kanata/HONIR J-band data. Motivated by this discovery, intensive follow-up observations of TXS 0506+056 were continuously performed, including our monitoring imaging observations, spectroscopic observations, and polarimetric observations in optical and near-infrared wavelengths. TXS 0506+056 showed a large-amplitude (~1.0 mag) variability in a time scale of several days or longer, although no significant variability was detected in a time scale of a day or shorter. TXS 0506+056 also showed a bluer-when-brighter trend in optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Structure functions of the variabilities were examined and indicate that TXS 0506+056 is not a special blazar in terms of optical variability. Polarization measurement results of TXS 0506+056 are also discussed.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASJ...73...25M
A GPU-accelerated image reduction pipeline;;We developed a high-speed image reduction pipeline using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) as hardware accelerators. Astronomers desire to detect the emission measure counterpart of gravitational-wave sources as soon as possible and to share in the systematic follow-up observation. Therefore, high-speed image processing is important. We developed a new image-reduction pipeline for our robotic telescope system, which uses a GPU via the Python package CuPy for high-speed image processing. As a result, the new pipeline has increased in processing speed by more than 40 times compared with the current one, while maintaining the same functions.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASJ...73...14N
A tidal disruption event coincident with a high-energy neutrino;;Cosmic neutrinos provide a unique window into the otherwise hidden mechanism of particle acceleration in astrophysical objects. The IceCube Collaboration recently reported the likely association of one high-energy neutrino with a flare from the relativistic jet of an active galaxy pointed towards the Earth. However a combined analysis of many similar active galaxies revealed no excess from the broader population, leaving the vast majority of the cosmic neutrino flux unexplained. Here we present the likely association of a radio-emitting tidal disruption event, AT2019dsg, with a second high-energy neutrino. AT2019dsg was identified as part of our systematic search for optical counterparts to high-energy neutrinos with the Zwicky Transient Facility. The probability of finding any coincident radio-emitting tidal disruption event by chance is 0.5%, while the probability of finding one as bright in bolometric energy flux as AT2019dsg is 0.2%. Our electromagnetic observations can be explained through a multizone model, with radio analysis revealing a central engine, embedded in a UV photosphere, that powers an extended synchrotron-emitting outflow. This provides an ideal site for petaelectronvolt neutrino production. Assuming that the association is genuine, our observations suggest that tidal disruption events with mildly relativistic outflows contribute to the cosmic neutrino flux.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatAs...5..510S
Tidally excited oscillations in hot white dwarfs;;We study the flux variation in helium white dwarfs (WDs) induced by dynamical tides for a variety of WD models with effective temperatures ranging from $T=10\, {\rm kK}$ to $T=26\, {\rm kK}$. At linear order, we find the dynamical tide can significantly perturb the observed flux in hot WDs. If the temperature $Trsim 14\, {\rm kK}$, then the dynamical tide may induce a fractional change in the flux by $ 1{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ when the orbital period is $P_{\rm orb}\simeq 20{\!-\!}60\, {\rm min}$. The ratio between the flux modulation due to the dynamical tide and that due to the equilibrium tide (i.e. ellipsoidal variability) increases as the WD's radius decreases, and it could exceed $\mathcal {O}(10)$ if the WD has a radius R ≲ 0.03 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Unlike the ellipsoidal variability which is in phase with the orbital motion, the pulsation caused by the dynamical tide may have a substantial phase shift. A cold WD with $T\simeq 10\, {\rm kK}$, on the other hand, is unlikely to show observable pulsations due to the dynamical tide. At shorter orbital periods, the dynamical tide may break and become highly non-linear. We approximate this regime by treating the waves as one-way travelling waves and find the flux variation is typically reduced to 0.1-1 per cent and the excess phase is ~90° (though with large uncertainty). Even in the travelling-wave limit, the flux perturbation due to dynamical tide could still exceed the ellipsoidal variability for compact WDs with R ≲ 0.02 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We further estimate the non-linear flux perturbations oscillating at four times the orbital frequency dominated by a self-coupled parent g-mode driving low-order daughter p modes. The non-linear flux variation could be nearly $50{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the linear variation for very hot WD models with $Trsim 26\, {\rm kK}$ and $1{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ linear flux variation. We thus predict that both the linear and non-linear flux variations due to dynamical tides are likely to have significant observational signatures.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.1836Y
Low-luminosity Type II supernovae - III. SN 2018hwm, a faint event with an unusually long plateau;;In this work, we present photometric and spectroscopic data of the low-luminosity (LL) Type IIP supernova (SN) 2018hwm. The object shows a faint (M<SUB>r</SUB> = -15 mag) and very long (~130 d) plateau, followed by a 2.7 mag drop in the r band to the radioactive tail. The first spectrum shows a blue continuum with narrow Balmer lines, while during the plateau the spectra show numerous metal lines, all with strong and narrow P-Cygni profiles. The expansion velocities are low, in the 1000-1400 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> range. The nebular spectrum, dominated by H α in emission, reveals weak emission from [O I] and [Ca II] doublets. The absolute light curve and spectra at different phases are similar to those of LL SNe IIP. We estimate that 0.002 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass were ejected, through hydrodynamical simulations. The best fit of the model to the observed data is found for an extremely low explosion energy of 0.055 foe, a progenitor radius of 215 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and a final progenitor mass of 9-10 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Finally, we performed a modelling of the nebular spectrum, to establish the amount of oxygen and calcium ejected. We found a low M(<SUP>16</SUP>O)$\approx 0.02\, \mathrm{ M}_{\odot }$, but a high M(<SUP>40</SUP>Ca) of 0.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The inferred low explosion energy, the low ejected <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass, and the progenitor parameters, along with peculiar features observed in the nebular spectrum, are consistent with both an electron-capture SN explosion of a superasymptotic giant branch star and with a low-energy, Ni-poor iron core-collapse SN from a 10-12 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> red supergiant.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.1059R
High-cadence, early-time observations of core-collapse supernovae from the TESS prime mission;;We present observations from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) of twenty bright core-collapse supernovae with peak TESS-band magnitudes ≲18 mag. We reduce this data with an implementation of the image subtraction pipeline used by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) optimized for use with the TESS images. In empirical fits to the rising light curves, we do not find strong correlations between the fit parameters and the peak luminosity. Existing semi-analytic models fit the light curves of the Type II supernovae well, but do not yield reasonable estimates of the progenitor radius or explosion energy, likely because they are derived for use with ultraviolet observations while TESS observes in the near-infrared. If we instead fit the data with numerically simulated light curves, the rising light curves of the Type II supernovae are consistent with the explosions of red supergiants. While we do not identify shock breakout emission for any individual event, when we combine the fit residuals of the Type II supernovae in our sample, we do find a >5σ flux excess in the ~1 d before the start of the light-curve rise. It is likely that this excess is due to shock breakout emission, and that during its extended mission TESS will observe a Type II supernova bright enough for this signal to be detected directly.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.500.5639V
Multiband light-curve analysis of the 40.5-min period eclipsing double-degenerate binary SDSS J082239.54+304857.19;;We present the Apache Point Observatory BG40 broad-band and simultaneous Gemini r-band and i-band high-speed follow-up photometry observations and analysis of the 40.5-min period eclipsing detached double-degenerate binary SDSS J082239.54+304857.19. Our APO data spans over 318 d and includes 13 primary eclipses, from which we precisely measure the system's orbital period and improve the time of mid-eclipse measurement. We fit the light curves for each filter individually and show that this system contains a low-mass DA white dwarf with radius R<SUB>A</SUB> = 0.031 ± 0.006 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a R<SUB>B</SUB> = 0.013 ± 0.005 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> companion at an inclination of i = 87.7 ± 0.2<SUP>○</SUP>. We use the best-fitting eclipsing light curve model to estimate the temperature of the secondary star as T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 5200 ± 100 K. Finally, while we do not record significant offsets to the expected time of mid-eclipse caused by the emission of gravitational waves with our 1-yr baseline, we show that a 3σ significant measurement of the orbital decay due to gravitational waves will be possible in 2023, at which point the eclipse will occur about 8 s earlier than expected.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.500.5098K
Calibrating the binary black hole population in nuclear star clusters through tidal disruption events;;As the sensitivity of gravitational wave (GW) instruments improves and new networks start operating, hundreds of merging stellar-mass black holes (SBHs) and intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are expected to be observed in the next few years. The origin and distribution of SBH and IMBH binaries in various dynamical environments is a fundamental scientific question in GW astronomy. In this paper, we discuss ways tidal disruption events (TDEs) may provide a unique electromagnetic window into the assembly and merger of binary SBHs and IMBHs in nuclear star clusters (NSCs). We discuss how the host NSC mass and density and the slope of the BH mass function set the orbital properties and the masses of the binaries that undergo a TDE. For typical NSC properties, we predict a TDE rate of ~10<SUP>-6</SUP>-10<SUP>-7</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> per galaxy. The light curve of TDEs in NSCs could be interrupted and modulated by the companion BH on the orbital period of the binary. These should be readily detectable by optical transient surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility and LSST.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.500.4307F
Flexible ligands-dependent formation of a new column layered MOF possess 1D channel and effective separation performance for CO<SUB>2</SUB>;;A new column layered MOF with (3,6)-connected nets, namely [Co(pysa)(H<SUB>2</SUB>O)]<SUB>n</SUB> (YAU-7), was synthesized by using Co(NO<SUB>3</SUB>)<SUB>2</SUB>·6H<SUB>2</SUB>O and organic ligand 2-(pyrid-4'-yl)-benzimidazole-5-carboxylic acid (H<SUB>2</SUB>pysa) as flexible linkers. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction evidences the 3D YAU-7 MOF with (3,6)-connected nodes, a binuclear cluster [Co<SUB>2</SUB>(COO)<SUB>2</SUB>] structure and 1D tunnel feature. The weak interactions of π---π stacking enhances chemical stability of YAU-7 3D structure. Interestingly, the YAU-7 presents high chemical/thermodynamic stability, superior adsorption performance for CO<SUB>2</SUB>, CH<SUB>4</SUB>, C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB> and C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>4</SUB>, and high IAST selectivities for mixed gas systems of C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB>/CO<SUB>2</SUB>, C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>4</SUB>/CO<SUB>2</SUB>, and CH<SUB>4</SUB>/CO<SUB>2</SUB> (50/50). In contrast, YAU-7 exhibits higher uptake of CO<SUB>2</SUB> (55.70 cm<SUP>3</SUP> g<SUP>-1</SUP>) compared with CH<SUB>4</SUB>, C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB>, and C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>4</SUB> (27.39, 23.36, and 9.04 cm<SUP>3</SUP> g<SUP>-1</SUP>) at 273 K. YAU-7 takes separation values for C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB>/CO<SUB>2</SUB>, C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>4</SUB>/CO<SUB>2</SUB>, and CH<SUB>4</SUB>/CO<SUB>2</SUB> mixture (37.6, 22.7, and 31.2) significantly higher than the C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB>/C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>4</SUB>, C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB>/CH<SUB>4</SUB>, C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB>/CO<SUB>2</SUB>, C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>4</SUB>/CH<SUB>4</SUB> mixture gas (1.30, 1.83, 1.67).

Gravitational wave friction in light of GW170817 and GW190521;;We use the gravitational wave (GW) events GW170817 and GW190521, together with their proposed electromagnetic counterparts, to constrain cosmological parameters and theories of gravity beyond General Relativity (GR). In particular we consider models with a time-varying Planck mass, large extra-dimensions, and a phenomenological parametrization covering several beyond-GR theories. In all three cases, this introduces a friction term into the GW propagation equation, effectively modifying the GW luminosity distance. We set constraints on \LCDM parameters and GR deviation parameters using two sets of priors on the Hubble constant and matter energy density. With priors set to the measured Planck's mission values, we find that with the inclusion of GW190521, the two GR deviation parameters constraints improve by a factor ~ 10. We report a number of space-time dimensions compatible with 4 with an precision of 2.5% (at 95% CL) and an upper limit to the variation of Newton's constant at the epoch of GW170817 of <20%. With wide priors on the Hubble constant and matter energy density, we show that it is still possible to constrain the \LCDM parameters and GR deviation parameters conjointly from GW170817 and GW190521, obtaining constraints on GR deviation parameters which are a factor 2-6 worse than the results using restricted priors on \LCDM parameters.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JCAP...02..043M
Electromagnetic bursts from mergers of oscillons in axion-like fields;;We investigate the bursts of electromagnetic and scalar radiation resulting from the collision, and merger of oscillons made from axion-like particles using 3+1 dimensional lattice simulations of the coupled axion-gauge field system. The radiation into photons is suppressed before the merger. However, it becomes the dominant source of energy loss after the merger if a resonance condition is satisfied. Conversely, the radiation in scalar waves is dominant during initial merger phase but suppressed after the merger. The backreaction of scalar and electromagnetic radiation is included in our simulations. We evolve the system long enough to see that the resonant photon production extracts a significant fraction of the initial axion energy, and again falls out of the resonance condition. We provide a parametric understanding of the time, and energy scales involved in the process and discuss observational prospects of detecting the electromagnetic signal.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JCAP...02..024A
Mid-infrared Outbursts in Nearby Galaxies (MIRONG). I. Sample Selection and Characterization;;Optical time-domain astronomy has grown rapidly in the past decade, but the dynamic infrared sky is rarely explored. Aiming to construct a sample of mid-infrared outbursts in nearby galaxies (MIRONG), we have conducted a systematical search of low-redshift (z < 0.35) Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic galaxies that have experienced recent mid-infrared (MIR) flares using their Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) light curves. A total of 137 galaxies have been selected by requiring a brightening amplitude of 0.5 mag in at least one WISE band with respect to their quiescent phases. Only a small fraction (10.9%) has corresponding optical flares. Except for the four supernovae (SNe) in our sample, the MIR luminosities of the remaining sources (L<SUB>4.6 μm</SUB> > 10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) are markedly brighter than known SNe, and their physical locations are very close to the galactic center (median <0"1). Only four galaxies are radio-loud, indicating that synchrotron radiation from relativistic jets could contribute to MIR variability. We propose that these MIR outbursts are dominated by the dust echoes of transient accretion onto supermassive black holes, such as tidal disruption events (TDEs) and turn-on (changing-look) active galactic nuclei. Moreover, the inferred peak MIR luminosity function is generally consistent with the X-ray and optical TDEs at the high end, albeit with large uncertainties. Our results suggest that a large population of transients has been overlooked by optical surveys, probably due to dust obscuration or intrinsically optical weakness. Thus, a search in the infrared band is crucial for us to obtain a panoramic picture of nuclear outburst. The multiwavelength follow-up observations of the MIRONG sample are in progress and will be presented in a series of subsequent papers.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..252...32J
Measuring the Hubble Constant with GW190521 as an Eccentric black hole Merger and Its Potential Electromagnetic Counterpart;;Gravitational-wave observations can be used to accurately measure the Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB> and could help understand the present discrepancy between constraints from Type Ia supernovae and the cosmic microwave background. Neutron star mergers are primarily used for this purpose as their electromagnetic emission can be used to greatly reduce measurement uncertainties. Here we quantify the implied H<SUB>0</SUB> using the recently observed black hole merger GW190521 and its candidate electromagnetic counterpart found by ZTF using a highly eccentric explanation of the properties of GW190521. As the electromagnetic association is currently uncertain, our main goal here is to determine the effect of eccentricity on the estimated H<SUB>0</SUB>. We obtain ${H}_{0}={68.8}_{-25.5}^{+45.7}$ km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Our results indicate that future H<SUB>0</SUB> computations using black hole mergers will need to account for possible eccentricity. For extreme cases, the orbital velocity of binaries in active galactic nucleus disks can represent a significant systematic uncertainty.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908L..34G
Tidal Disruption Event Hosts Are Green and Centrally Concentrated: Signatures of a Post-merger System;;We study the properties of the galaxies hosting the first 19 tidal disruption events (TDEs) detected with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) within the context of a carefully constructed, representative host galaxy sample. We find that the ZTF sample of TDE hosts is dominated by compact "green valley" galaxies. After we restrict the comparison sample to galaxies with a similar concentration, as measured by the Sérsic index, we find this green valley overrepresentation is even larger. That is, concentrated red sequence galaxies are not producing TDEs at elevated levels. We present host galaxy spectra that show that E + A galaxies are overrepresented in the ZTF sample by a factor of ≈22, which is lower than previous TDE host galaxy studies have found. We find that this overrepresentation can be fully accounted for when taking into account the masses, colors, and Sérsic indices of the ZTF TDE hosts. The combination of both green colors and high Sérsic index of the typical TDE host galaxy could be explained if the TDE rate is temporarily enhanced following a merger that leads to a higher central concentration of stars.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908L..20H
Constraints on the Rate of Supernovae Lasting for More Than a Year from Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam;;Some supernovae, such as pair-instability supernovae, are predicted to have a duration of more than a year in the observer frame. To constrain the rates of supernovae lasting for more than a year, we conducted a long-term deep transient survey using Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the 8.2 m Subaru telescope. HSC is a wide-field (a 1.75 deg<SUP>2</SUP> field-of-view) camera and it can efficiently conduct transient surveys. We observed the same 1.75 deg<SUP>2</SUP> field repeatedly using the g-, r-, i-, and z-band filters with the typical depth of 26 mag for four seasons (from late 2016 to early 2020). Using these data, we searched for transients lasting for more than a year. Two supernovae were detected in two continuous seasons, one supernova was detected in three continuous seasons, but no transients lasted for all four seasons searched. The discovery rate of supernovae lasting for more than a year with the typical limiting magnitudes of 26 mag is constrained to be ${1.4}_{-0.7}^{+1.3}$ $(\mathrm{stat}.){}_{-0.3}^{+0.2}(\mathrm{sys}.)\,\mathrm{events}\,{\deg }^{-2}\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$ . All the long-lasting supernovae we found are likely Type IIn supernovae and our results indicate that about 40% of Type IIn supernovae have long-lasting light curves. No plausible pair-instability supernova candidates lasting for more than a year are discovered. By comparing the survey results and survey simulations, we constrain the luminous pair-instability supernova rate up to z ≃ 3 is of the order of 100 Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> at most, which is 0.01-0.1% of the core-collapse supernova rate.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908..249M
Near-infrared and Optical Observations of Type Ic SN 2020oi and Broad-lined Type Ic SN 2020bvc: Carbon Monoxide, Dust, and High-velocity Supernova Ejecta;;We present near-IR (NIR) and optical observations of the Type Ic supernova (SN Ic) SN 2020oi in the galaxy M100 and the broad-lined SN Ic SN 2020bvc in UGC 9379, using Gemini, Las Cumbres Observatory, Southern Astrophysical Telescope, and other ground-based telescopes. The NIR spectrum of SN 2020oi at day 63 since the explosion shows strong CO emissions and a rising K-band continuum, which is the first unambiguous dust detection from an SN Ic. Non-LTE CO modeling shows that CO is still optically thick and that the lower limit to the CO mass is 10<SUP>-3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The dust temperature is 810 K, and the dust mass is ∼10<SUP>-5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We explore the possibilities that the dust is freshly formed in the ejecta, heated dust in the preexisting circumstellar medium, and an infrared echo. The light curves of SN 2020oi are consistent with a STELLA model with canonical explosion energy, 0.07 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> Ni mass, and 0.7 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> ejecta mass. A model of high explosion energy of 10<SUP>52</SUP> erg, 0.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> Ni mass, and 6.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> ejecta mass with the circumstellar matter reproduces the double-peaked light curves of SN 2020bvc. We observe temporal changes of absorption features of the IR Ca II triplet, S I at 1.043 μm, and Fe II at 5169 Å. The blueshifted lines indicate high velocities, up to 60,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> for SN 2020bvc and 20,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> for SN 2020oi, and the expansion velocity rapidly declines before the optical maximum. We present modeled spectral signatures and diagnostics of CO and SiO molecular bands between 1.4 and 10 μm.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908..232R
Identifying Candidate Optical Variables Using Gaia Data Release 2;;Gaia is undertaking a deep synoptic survey of the Galaxy, but photometry from individual epochs has, as of yet, only been released for a minimal number of sources. We show that it is possible to identify variable stars in Gaia Data Release 2 by selecting stars with unexpectedly large photometric uncertainties given their brightness and number of observations. By comparing our results to existing catalogs of variables, we show that information on the amplitude of variability is also implicitly present in the Gaia photometric uncertainties. We present a catalog of about 9.3 million candidate variable stars, and discuss its limitations and prospects for future tests and extensions.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908..180A
GHOST: Using Only Host Galaxy Information to Accurately Associate and Distinguish Supernovae;;We present GHOST, a database of 16,175 spectroscopically classified supernovae (SNe) and the properties of their host galaxies. We have constructed GHOST using a novel host galaxy association method that employs deep postage stamps of the field surrounding a transient. Our gradient ascent method achieves fewer misassociations for low-z hosts and higher completeness for high-z hosts than previous methods. Using dimensionality reduction, we identify the host galaxy properties that distinguish SN classes. Our results suggest that the host galaxies of superluminous SNe, Type Ia SNe, and core-collapse SNe can be separated by brightness and derived extendedness measures. Next, we train a random forest model to predict SN class using only host galaxy information and the radial offset of the SN. We can distinguish Type Ia SNe and core-collapse SNe with ∼70% accuracy without any photometric or spectroscopic data from the event itself. Vera C. Rubin Observatory will usher in a new era of transient population studies, demanding improved photometric tools for rapid identification and classification of transient events. By identifying the host features with high discriminatory power, we will maintain SN sample purities and continue to identify scientifically relevant events as data volumes increase. The GHOST database and our corresponding software for associating transients with host galaxies are both publicly available through the astro_ghost package.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908..170G
The Young Supernova Experiment: Survey Goals, Overview, and Operations;;Time-domain science has undergone a revolution over the past decade, with tens of thousands of new supernovae (SNe) discovered each year. However, several observational domains, including SNe within days or hours of explosion and faint, red transients, are just beginning to be explored. Here we present the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE), a novel optical time-domain survey on the Pan-STARRS telescopes. Our survey is designed to obtain well-sampled griz light curves for thousands of transient events up to z ≈ 0.2. This large sample of transients with four-band light curves will lay the foundation for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, providing a critical training set in similar filters and a well-calibrated low-redshift anchor of cosmologically useful SNe Ia to benefit dark energy science. As the name suggests, YSE complements and extends other ongoing time-domain surveys by discovering fast-rising SNe within a few hours to days of explosion. YSE is the only current four-band time-domain survey and is able to discover transients as faint as ∼21.5 mag in gri and ∼20.5 mag in z, depths that allow us to probe the earliest epochs of stellar explosions. YSE is currently observing approximately 750 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of sky every 3 days, and we plan to increase the area to 1500 deg<SUP>2</SUP> in the near future. When operating at full capacity, survey simulations show that YSE will find ∼5000 new SNe per year and at least two SNe within 3 days of explosion per month. To date, YSE has discovered or observed 8.3% of the transient candidates reported to the International Astronomical Union in 2020. We present an overview of YSE, including science goals, survey characteristics, and a summary of our transient discoveries to date.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908..143J
Extremely Energetic Supernova Explosions Embedded in a Massive Circumstellar Medium: The Case of SN 2016aps;;We perform one-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of energetic supernova (SN) ejecta colliding with a massive circumstellar medium (CSM) aimed at explaining SN 2016aps, likely the brightest SN observed to date. SN 2016aps was a superluminous Type IIn SN, which released as much as $rsim 5\times {10}^{51}$ erg of thermal radiation. Our results suggest that the multiband light curve of SN 2016aps is well explained by the collision of a $30\,{M}_{\odot }$ SN ejecta with the explosion energy of 10<SUP>52</SUP> erg and a $\simeq 8\,{M}_{\odot }$ wind-like CSM with the outer radius of 10<SUP>16</SUP> cm, that is, a hypernova explosion embedded in a massive CSM. This finding indicates that very massive stars with initial masses larger than $40\,{M}_{\odot }$ , which supposedly produce highly energetic SNe, occasionally eject their hydrogen-rich envelopes shortly before the core collapse. We suggest that the pulsational pair-instability SNe may provide a natural explanation for the massive CSM and the energetic explosion. We also provide the relations among the peak luminosity, the radiated energy and the rise time for interacting SNe with the kinetic energy of 10<SUP>52</SUP> erg, which can be used for interpreting SN 2016aps-like objects in future surveys.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908...99S
Early-time Light Curves of Type Ia Supernovae Observed with TESS;;We present the early-time light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observed in the first six sectors of Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data. Ten of these SNe were discovered by ASAS-SN, seven by ATLAS, six by ZTF, and one by Gaia. For nine of these objects with sufficient dynamic range (>3.0 mag from detection to peak), we fit power-law models and searched for signatures of companion stars. We found a diversity of early-time light-curve shapes, although most of our sources are consistent with fireball models where the flux increases as ∝t<SUP>2</SUP>. Three SNe displayed a flatter rise with flux ∝t. We did not find any obvious evidence for additional structures, such as multiple power-law components, in the early rising light curves. For assumptions about the SN properties and the observer viewing angle (ejecta mass of 1.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, expansion velocity of 10<SUP>4</SUP> km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, opacity of 0.2 cm<SUP>2</SUP> g<SUP>-1</SUP>, and viewing angle of 45°) and a further assumption that any companion stars would be in Roche lobe overflow, it is possible to place upper limits on the radii of any companion stars. Six of the nine SNe had complete coverage of the early-time light curves, and we placed upper limits on the radii of companion stars of ≲32 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> for these SNe, ≲20 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> for five of the six, and ≲4 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> for two of the six. The small sample size did not allow us to put limits on the occurrence rate of companion stars in the progenitors of SNe Ia. However, we expect that TESS observed enough SNe in its two-year primary mission (26 sectors) to either detect the signature of a large companion (R > 20 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>) or constrain the occurrence rate of such systems, at least for the fiducial SN properties adopted here. We also show that TESS is capable of detecting emission from a 1 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> companion for an SN Ia within 50 Mpc and has a reasonable chance of doing so after about six years.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908...51F
Seventeen Tidal Disruption Events from the First Half of ZTF Survey Observations: Entering a New Era of Population Studies;;While tidal disruption events (TDEs) have long been heralded as laboratories for the study of quiescent black holes, the small number of known TDEs and uncertainties in their emission mechanism have hindered progress toward this promise. Here we present 17 new TDEs that have been detected recently by the Zwicky Transient Facility along with Swift UV and X-ray follow-up observations. Our homogeneous analysis of the optical/UV light curves, including 22 previously known TDEs from the literature, reveals a clean separation of light-curve properties with spectroscopic class. The TDEs with Bowen fluorescence features in their optical spectra have smaller blackbody radii, lower optical luminosities, and higher disruption rates compared to the rest of the sample. The small subset of TDEs that show only helium emission lines in their spectra have the longest rise times, the highest luminosities, and the lowest rates. A high detection rate of Bowen lines in TDEs with small photometric radii could be explained by the high density that is required for this fluorescence mechanism. The stellar debris can provide a source for this dense material. Diffusion of photons through this debris may explain why the rise and fade timescale of the TDEs in our sample are not correlated. We also report, for the first time, the detection of soft X-ray flares from a TDE on ∼day timescales. Based on the fact that the X-ray flares peak at a luminosity similar to the optical/UV blackbody luminosity, we attribute them to brief glimpses through a reprocessing layer that otherwise obscures the inner accretion flow.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908....4V
Search for Black Hole Merger Families;;The origin, environment, and evolution of stellar-mass black hole (BH) binaries are still a mystery. One of the proposed binary formation mechanisms is manifest in dynamical interactions between multiple BHs. A resulting framework of these dynamical interactions is the so-called hierarchical triple-merger scenario, which happens when three BHs become gravitationally bound, causing two successive BH mergers to occur. In such successive mergers, the BHs involved are directly related to each other, and hence this channel can be directly tested from the properties of the detected binary BH mergers. Here we present a search for hierarchical triple mergers among events within the first and second gravitational-wave transient catalogs of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory/Virgo, the eccentric localization of GW190521, and those found by the IAS-Princeton group. The search includes improved statistical quantification that also accounts for BH spins. We perform our analysis for different upper bounds on the mass distribution of first-generation BHs. Our results demonstrate the importance of the mass distributions' properties for constraining the hierarchical merger scenario. We present the individually significant merger pairs. The search yields interesting candidate families and hints of its future impact.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...907L..48V
An Extraordinary Response of Iron Emission to the Central Outburst in a Tidal Disruption Event Candidate;;Understanding the origin of Fe II emission is important because it is crucial to construct the main sequence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Despite several decades of observational and theoretical effort, the location of the optical iron emitting region and the mechanism responsible for the positive correlation between the Fe II strength and the black hole accretion rate remain open questions. In this Letter, we report the optical Fe II response to the central outburst in PS1-10adi, a candidate tidal disruption event taking place in an AGN at z = 0.203 that has aroused extensive attention. For the first time, we observe that the Fe II response in the rising phase of its central luminosity is significantly more prominent than that in the decline phase, showing a hysteresis effect. We interpret this hysteresis effect as a consequence of the gradual sublimation of the dust grains situating at the inner surface of the torus into gas when the luminosity of the central engine increases. It is the iron element released from the sublimated dust that contributes evidently to the observed Fe II emission. This interpretation, together with the weak response of the Hβ emission as we observe, naturally explains the applicability of relative Fe II strength as a tracer of the Eddington ratio. In addition, optical iron emission of this origin renders the Fe II time lag a potential "standard candle" with cosmological implications.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...907L..29H
Bright, Months-long Stellar Outbursts Announce the Explosion of Interaction-powered Supernovae;;Interaction-powered supernovae (SNe) explode within an optically thick circumstellar medium (CSM) that could be ejected during eruptive events. To identify and characterize such pre-explosion outbursts, we produce forced-photometry light curves for 196 interacting SNe, mostly of Type IIn, detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility between early 2018 and 2020 June. Extensive tests demonstrate that we only expect a few false detections among the 70,000 analyzed pre-explosion images after applying quality cuts and bias corrections. We detect precursor eruptions prior to 18 Type IIn SNe and prior to the Type Ibn SN 2019uo. Precursors become brighter and more frequent in the last months before the SN and month-long outbursts brighter than magnitude -13 occur prior to 25% (5-69%, 95% confidence range) of all Type IIn SNe within the final three months before the explosion. With radiative energies of up to 10<SUP>49</SUP> erg, precursors could eject ∼1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of material. Nevertheless, SNe with detected precursors are not significantly more luminous than other SNe IIn, and the characteristic narrow hydrogen lines in their spectra typically originate from earlier, undetected mass-loss events. The long precursor durations require ongoing energy injection, and they could, for example, be powered by interaction or by a continuum-driven wind. Instabilities during the neon- and oxygen-burning phases are predicted to launch precursors in the final years to months before the explosion; however, the brightest precursor is 100 times more energetic than anticipated.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...907...99S
Improving Damped Random Walk Parameters for SDSS Stripe 82 Quasars with Pan-STARRS1;;We use the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1 Survey (Pan-STARRS1, PS1) data to extend the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 quasar light curves. Combining PS1 and SDSS light curves provides a 15 yr baseline for 9248 quasars—5 yr longer than prior studies that used only SDSS. We fit the light curves with the damped random walk (DRW) model—a statistical description of their variability. We correlate the resulting DRW model parameters: asymptotic variability amplitude SF<SUB>∞</SUB>, and characteristic timescale τ, with quasar physical properties—black hole mass, bolometric luminosity, and redshift. Using simulated light curves, we find that a longer baseline allows us to better constrain the DRW parameters. After adding PS1 data, the variability amplitude is a stronger function of the black hole mass and has a weaker dependence on quasar luminosity. In addition, the characteristic timescale τ dependence on quasar luminosity is marginally weaker. We also make predictions for the fidelity of DRW model parameter retrieval when light curves will be further extended with Zwicky Transient Facility and Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time data. Finally, we show how updated DRW parameters offer an independent method of discovering changing-look quasar candidates (CLQSOs). The candidates are outliers in terms of differences in magnitude and scatter between the SDSS and PS1 segments. We identify 40 objects (35 newly reported) with a tenfold increase in the variability timescale between SDSS and SDSS-PS1 data due to a large change in brightness (over 0.5 mag)—characteristic for CLQSOs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...907...96S
Dust Production from Mini Outbursts of Comet 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1;;Here we report on the results of observations of comet 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 obtained using four telescopes, in three different countries, from 2019 September 25 to 2020 January 19. During the last four months of 2019, comet 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 exhibited new outburst behavior indicative of small or mini outbursts in which the brightening of the comet lasted from only a few days to more than a week. We used Johnson-Cousins R<SUB>C</SUB>-band multi-aperture photometry measurements to calculate the dust production, via Afρ, the dust production rate, and the dust brightness profile of the comet for each night of observations. During these observations, the brightness of the comet fluctuated significantly multiple times, with notable changes in brightness ranging from 0.41 to 0.71 mag over time periods of only a couple of days to nearly two weeks.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....161...73C
X-ray and ultraviolet observations of the eclipsing cataclysmic variables OV Bootis and SDSS J103533.02+055158.3 with degenerate donors;;Context. The majority of cataclysmic variables are predicted to be post-period minimum systems with degenerate donor stars, the period bouncers. Owing to their intrinsic faintness, however, only a handful of these systems have so far been securely identified. 
 Aims: We want to study the X-ray properties of two eclipsing period bouncers, OV Bootis and SDSS J103533.02+055158.3, that were selected for this study due to their proximity to Earth. 
 Methods: We have obtained XMM-Newton phase-resolved X-ray and ultraviolet observations of the two objects for spectral and timing analysis. 
 Results: Owing to a recent dwarf nova outburst OV Bootis was much brighter than SDSS J103533.02+055158.3 at X-ray and ultraviolet wavelengths and the eclipse could be studied in some detail. An updated eclipse ephemeris was derived. The X-rays were shown to originate close to the white dwarf, the boundary layer, with significant absorption affecting its spectrum. There was no absorption in SDSS J103533.02+055158.3, despite being observed at the same inclination indicating different shapes of the disk and the disk rim. The white-dwarf temperature was re-determined for both objects: the white dwarf in OV Bootis was still hot (23 000 K) five months after a dwarf nova outburst, and the white dwarf in SDSS J103533.02+055158.3 hotter than assumed previously (T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 11 500 K). 
 Conclusions: All three cataclysmic variables with degenerate donors studied so far in X-rays, including SDSS J121209.31+013627.7, were clearly discovered in X-rays and revealed mass accretion rates Ṁ = 8 × 10<SUP>-15</SUP> - 4 × 10 - 13 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. If their X-ray behavior is representative of the subpopulation of period bouncers, the all-sky X-ray surveys with eROSITA together with comprehensive follow-up will uncover new objects in sufficient number to address the remaining questions concerning late-stage cataclysmic variable evolution.

Forbidden hugs in pandemic times. I. Luminous red nova AT 2019zhd, a new merger in M 31;;We present the follow-up campaign of the luminous red nova (LRN) <ASTROBJ>AT 2019zhd</ASTROBJ>, the third event of this class observed in <ASTROBJ>M 31</ASTROBJ>. The object was followed by several sky surveys for about five months before the outburst, during which it showed a slow luminosity rise. In this phase, the absolute magnitude ranged from M<SUB>r</SUB> = -2.8 ± 0.2 mag to M<SUB>r</SUB> = -5.6 ± 0.1 mag. Then, over a four to five day period, <ASTROBJ>AT 2019zhd</ASTROBJ> experienced a major brightening, reaching a peak of M<SUB>r</SUB> = -9.61 ± 0.08 mag and an optical luminosity of 1.4 × 10<SUP>39</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. After a fast decline, the light curve settled onto a short-duration plateau in the red bands. Although less pronounced, this feature is reminiscent of the second red maximum observed in other LRNe. This phase was followed by a rapid linear decline in all bands. At maximum, the spectra show a blue continuum with prominent Balmer emission lines. The post-maximum spectra show a much redder continuum, resembling that of an intermediate-type star. In this phase, Hα becomes very weak, Hβ is no longer detectable, and a forest of narrow absorption metal lines now dominate the spectrum. The latest spectra, obtained during the post-plateau decline, show a very red continuum (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ≈ 3000 K) with broad molecular bands of TiO, similar to those of M-type stars. The long-lasting, slow photometric rise observed before the peak resembles that of LRN <ASTROBJ>V1309 Sco</ASTROBJ>, which was interpreted as the signature of the common-envelope ejection. The subsequent outburst is likely due to the gas outflow following a stellar merging event. The inspection of archival HST images taken 22 years before the LRN discovery reveals a faint red source (M<SUB>F555W</SUB> = 0.21 ± 0.14 mag, with F555W - F814W = 2.96 ± 0.12 mag) at the position of <ASTROBJ>AT 2019zhd</ASTROBJ>, which is the most likely quiescent precursor. The source is consistent with expectations for a binary system including a predominant M5-type star.

Is supernova SN 2020faa an iPTF14hls look-alike?;;Context. We present observations of ZTF20aatqesi (SN 2020faa). This Type II supernova (SN) displays a luminous light curve (LC) that started to rebrighten from an initial decline. We investigate this in relation to the famous SN iPTF14hls, which received a great deal of attention and multiple interpretations in the literature, but whose nature and source of energy still remain unknown. 
 Aims: We demonstrate the great similarity between SN 2020faa and iPTF14hls during the first 6 months, and use this comparison to forecast the evolution of SN 2020faa and to reflect on the less well observed early evolution of iPTF14hls. 
 Methods: We present and analyse our observational data, consisting mainly of optical LCs from the Zwicky Transient Facility in the gri bands and of a sequence of optical spectra. We construct colour curves and a bolometric lc, and we compare ejecta-velocity and black-body radius evolutions for the two supernovae (SNe) and for more typical Type II SNe. 
 Results: The LCs show a great similarity with those of iPTF14hls over the first 6 months in luminosity, timescale, and colour. In addition, the spectral evolution of SN 2020faa is that of a Type II SN, although it probes earlier epochs than those available for iPTF14hls. 
 Conclusions: The similar LC behaviour is suggestive of SN 2020faa being a new iPTF14hls. We present these observations now to advocate follow-up observations, since most of the more striking evolution of SN iPTF14hls came later, with LC undulations and a spectacular longevity. On the other hand, for SN 2020faa we have better constraints on the explosion epoch than we had for iPTF14hls, and we have been able to spectroscopically monitor it from earlier phases than was done for the more famous sibling.

Research on the readout noise suppression method for digital correlated double sampling;;As the areas of CCD detectors and CCD mosaics have become larger and larger, the number of readout channels in astronomical cameras has increased accordingly to keep the image readout time within an acceptable range. For the large area cameras or the mosaic cameras, the analog Correlated Double Sampling (aCDS) circuit used in traditional astronomical cameras for suppressing readout noise is difficult to integrate into the camera controllers within the constraints of the space and energy consumption. Recently, digital CDS (dCDS) technology has been developed to solve this problem, which also offers novel analysis and noise suppression methods. In this study, a mathematical model is presented to conveniently analyze the frequency characteristic of a dCDS circuit, which is then simulated by a numerical method for investigating the noise suppression capability with different sampling weights. Importantly, using this model, the extreme point with lowest readout noise can be predicted for a certain dCDS model; and for a specific CCD readout frequency, readout noise can be suppressed by selecting the proper dCDS model. A testing system is then constructed for validating the efficiency of the proposed method.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021RAA....21...13D
Direct Determination of Supermassive Black Hole Properties with Gravitational-Wave Radiation from Surrounding Stellar-Mass Black Hole Binaries;;A significant number of stellar-mass black-hole (BH) binaries may merge in galactic nuclei or in the surrounding gas disks. With purposed space-borne gravitational-wave observatories, we may use such a binary as a signal carrier to probe modulations induced by a central supermassive BH (SMBH), which further allows us to place constraints on the SMBH's properties. We show in particular the de Sitter precession of the inner stellar-mass binary's orbital angular momentum (AM) around the AM of the outer orbit will be detectable if the precession period is comparable to the duration of observation, typically a few years. Once detected, the precession can be combined with the Doppler shift arising from the outer orbital motion to determine the mass of the SMBH and the outer orbital separation individually and each with percent-level accuracy. If we further assume a joint detection by space-borne and ground-based detectors, the detectability threshold could be extended to a precession period of ∼100 yr .;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PhRvL.126b1101Y
Cosmology requirements on supernova photometric redshift systematics for the Rubin LSST and Roman Space Telescope;;Some million type Ia supernovae (SN) will be discovered and monitored during upcoming wide area time domain surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). For cosmological use, accurate redshifts are needed among other characteristics; however the vast majority of the SN will not have spectroscopic redshifts, even for their host galaxies, only photometric redshifts. We assess the redshift systematic control necessary for robust cosmology. Based on the photometric vs true redshift relation generated by machine learning applied to a simulation of 500,000 galaxies as observed with LSST quality, we quantify requirements on systematics in the mean relation and in the outlier fraction and deviance so as not to bias dark energy cosmological inference. Certain redshift ranges are particularly sensitive, motivating spectroscopic followup of SN at z ≲0.2 and around z ≈0.5 - 0.6 . Including Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope near infrared bands in the simulation, we reanalyze the constraints, finding improvements at high redshift but little at the low redshifts where systematics lead to strong cosmology bias. We identify a complete spectroscopic survey of SN host galaxies for z ≲0.2 as a highly favored element for robust SN cosmology.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PhRvD.103b3524M
Processing GOTO data with the Rubin Observatory LSST Science Pipelines I: Production of coadded frames;;The past few decades have seen the burgeoning of wide-field, high-cadence surveys, the most formidable of which will be the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) to be conducted by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. So new is the field of systematic time-domain survey astronomy; however, that major scientific insights will continue to be obtained using smaller, more flexible systems than the LSST. One such example is the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) whose primary science objective is the optical follow-up of gravitational wave events. The amount and rate of data production by GOTO and other wide-area, high-cadence surveys presents a significant challenge to data processing pipelines which need to operate in near-real time to fully exploit the time domain. In this study, we adapt the Rubin Observatory LSST Science Pipelines to process GOTO data, thereby exploring the feasibility of using this `off-the-shelf' pipeline to process data from other wide-area, high-cadence surveys. In this paper, we describe how we use the LSST Science Pipelines to process raw GOTO frames to ultimately produce calibrated coadded images and photometric source catalogues. After comparing the measured astrometry and photometry to those of matched sources from PanSTARRS DR1, we find that measured source positions are typically accurate to subpixel levels, and that measured L-band photometries are accurate to $∼50$ mmag at $m_L∼16$ and $∼200$ mmag at $m_L∼18$. These values compare favourably to those obtained using GOTO's primary, in-house pipeline, GOTOPHOTO, in spite of both pipelines having undergone further development and improvement beyond the implementations used in this study. Finally, we release a generic `obs package' that others can build upon, should they wish to use the LSST Science Pipelines to process data from other facilities.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASA...38....4M
High cadence optical transient searches using drift scan imaging II: Event rate upper limits on optical transients of duration <21 ms and magnitude <6.6;;We have realised a simple prototype system to perform searches for short timescale optical transients, utilising the novel drift scan imaging technique described by Tingay (2020). We used two coordinated and aligned cameras, with an overlap field of view of approximately 3.7 deg$^2$, to capture over $34 000 × 5$ second images during approximately 24 h of observing. The system is sensitive to optical transients, due to an effective exposure time per pixel of 21 ms, brighter than a V magnitude of 6.6. In our 89.7 deg$^2$ h of observations, we find no candidate astronomical transients, giving an upper limit to the rate of these transients of 0.8 per deg$^2$ per day, competitive with other experiments of this type. The system is triggered by reflections from satellites and various instrumental effects, which are easily identifiable due to the two camera system. The next step in the development of this promising technique is to move to a system with larger apertures and wider fields of view.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASA...38....1T
Photometric study for near-Earth asteroid (155140) 2005 UD;;The Apollo-type near-Earth asteroid (155140) 2005 UD is thought to be a member of the Phaethon-Geminid meteor stream Complex (PGC). Its basic physical parameters are important for unveiling its origin and its relationship to the other PGC members as well as to the Geminid stream. Adopting the Lommel-Seeliger ellipsoid method and H, G<SUB>1</SUB>, G<SUB>2</SUB> phase function, we carry out spin, shape, and phase curve inversion using the photometric data of 2005 UD. The data consists of 11 new lightcurves, 3 lightcurves downloaded from the Minor Planet Center, and 288 sparse data points downloaded from the Zwicky Transient Facility database. As a result, we derive the pole solution of (285<SUP>∘</SUP> .8<SUB>-5.3</SUB><SUP>+1.1</SUP>, - 25<SUP>∘</SUP> .8<SUB>-12.5</SUB><SUP>+5.3</SUP>) in the ecliptic frame of J2000.0 with the rotational period of 5.2340<SUB>-0.00001</SUB><SUP>+0.00004</SUP> h. The corresponding triaxial shape (semiaxes a >b > c) is estimated as b / a = 0.76<SUB>-0.01</SUB><SUP>+0.01</SUP> and c / a = 0.40<SUB>-0.01</SUB><SUP>+0.03</SUP>. Using the calibrated photometric data of 2005 UD, the phase function parameters H, G<SUB>1</SUB>, G<SUB>2</SUB> are estimated as 17.22<SUB>-0.03</SUB><SUP>+0.03</SUP> mag, 0.61<SUB>-0.02</SUB><SUP>+0.02</SUP>, and - 0.006<SUB>-0.006</SUB><SUP>+0.006</SUP>, respectively. Correspondingly, the phase integral q, photometric phase coefficient k, and the enhancement factor ζ are 0.2508, -1.9224, and 1.6642. From the values of G<SUB>1</SUB> and G<SUB>2</SUB>, 2005 UD is likely to be a C-type asteroid. We estimate the equivalent diameter of 2005 UD from the new H-value: it is 1.28 ± 0.02 km using its new geometric albedo of 0.14.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021P&SS..19505120H
Gravitational-wave physics and astronomy in the 2020s and 2030s;;The 100 years since the publication of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity saw significant development of the understanding of the theory, the identification of potential astrophysical sources of sufficiently strong gravitational waves and development of key technologies for gravitational-wave detectors. In 2015, the first gravitational-wave signals were detected by the two US Advanced LIGO instruments. In 2017, Advanced LIGO and the European Advanced Virgo detectors pinpointed a binary neutron star coalescence that was also seen across the electromagnetic spectrum. The field of gravitational-wave astronomy is just starting, and this Roadmap of future developments surveys the potential for growth in bandwidth and sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors, and discusses the science results anticipated to come from upcoming instruments.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatRP...3..344B
Optical follow-up of the neutron star-black hole mergers S200105ae and S200115j;;LIGO and Virgo's third observing run revealed the first neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger candidates in gravitational waves. These events are predicted to synthesize r-process elements<SUP>1,2</SUP> creating optical/near-infrared `kilonova' emission. The joint gravitational wave and electromagnetic detection of an NSBH merger could be used to constrain the equation of state of dense nuclear matter<SUP>3</SUP>, and independently measure the local expansion rate of the Universe<SUP>4</SUP>. Here, we present the optical follow-up and analysis of two of the only three high-significance NSBH merger candidates detected to date, S200105ae and S200115j, with the Zwicky Transient Facility<SUP>5</SUP>. The Zwicky Transient Facility observed ~48% of S200105ae and ~22% of S200115j's localization probabilities, with observations sensitive to kilonovae brighter than -17.5 mag fading at 0.5 mag d<SUP>-1</SUP> in the g- and r-bands; extensive searches and systematic follow-up of candidates did not yield a viable counterpart. We present state-of-the-art kilonova models tailored to NSBH systems that place constraints on the ejecta properties of these NSBH mergers. We show that with observed depths of apparent magnitude ~22 mag, attainable in metre-class, wide-field-of-view survey instruments, strong constraints on ejecta mass are possible, with the potential to rule out low mass ratios, high black hole spins and large neutron star radii.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatAs...5...46A
ZZ Piscis Austrinus (ZZ PsA): a bright red nova progenitor and the instability mass ratio of contact binary stars;;ZZ Piscis Austrinus (ZZ PsA) is a neglected bright southern contact binary system with maximum V magnitude of 9.26. We present the first multiband photometric analysis and find the system to be in deep contact (>95 per cent) with an extremely low mass ratio of 0.078. The primary has a mass of 1.213 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> in keeping with its reported spectral class of F6. In order to determine if ZZ PsA is a merger candidate, we outline the current status regarding the instability mass ratio and develop new relationship linking the mass of the primary to the instability mass ratio of the system and the degree of contact. We find that ZZ PsA along with two other examples from the literature to be merger candidates while an additional three require further observations to be confirmed as potential merger candidates.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501..229W
PS15cey and PS17cke: prospective candidates from the Pan-STARRS Search for kilonovae;;Time domain astronomy was revolutionized with the discovery of the first kilonova, AT2017gfo, in August 2017, which was associated with the gravitational wave signal GW170817. Since this event, numerous wide-field surveys have been optimizing search strategies to maximize their efficiency of detecting these fast and faint transients. With the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS), we have been conducting a volume-limited survey for intrinsically faint and fast-fading events to a distance of D ≃ 200 Mpc. Two promising candidates have been identified from this archival search, with sparse data - PS15cey and PS17cke. Here, we present more detailed analysis and discussion of their nature. We observe that PS15cey was a luminous, fast-declining transient at 320 Mpc. Models of BH-NS mergers with a very stiff equation of state could possibly reproduce the luminosity and decline but the physical parameters are extreme. A more likely scenario is that this was an AT2018kzr-like merger event. PS17cke was a faint and fast-declining event at 15 Mpc. We explore several explosion scenarios of this transient including models of it as a NS-NS and BH-NS merger, the outburst of a massive luminous star, and compare it against other known fast-fading transients. Although there is uncertainty in the explosion scenario due to difficulty in measuring the explosion epoch, we find PS17cke to be a plausible kilonova candidate from the model comparisons.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.500.4213M
Discovery of a candidate binary supermassive black hole in a periodic quasar from circumbinary accretion variability;;Binary supermassive black holes (BSBHs) are expected to be a generic byproduct from hierarchical galaxy formation. The final coalescence of BSBHs is thought to be the loudest gravitational wave (GW) siren, yet no confirmed BSBH is known in the GW-dominated regime. While periodic quasars have been proposed as BSBH candidates, the physical origin of the periodicity has been largely uncertain. Here, we report discovery of a periodicity (p = 1607 ± 7 d) at 99.95 per cent significance (with a global p value of ~10<SUP>-3</SUP> accounting for the look elsewhere effect) in the optical light curves of a redshift 1.53 quasar, SDSS J025214.67-002813.7. Combining archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey data with new, sensitive imaging from the Dark Energy Survey, the total ~20-yr time baseline spans ~4.6 cycles of the observed 4.4-yr (rest frame 1.7-yr) periodicity. The light curves are best fit by a bursty model predicted by hydrodynamic simulations of circumbinary accretion discs. The periodicity is likely caused by accretion rate modulation by a milli-parsec BSBH emitting GWs, dynamically coupled to the circumbinary accretion disc. A bursty hydrodynamic variability model is statistically preferred over a smooth, sinusoidal model expected from relativistic Doppler boost, a kinematic effect proposed for PG1302-102. Furthermore, the frequency dependence of the variability amplitudes disfavours Doppler boost, lending independent support to the circumbinary accretion variability hypothesis. Given our detection rate of one BSBH candidate from circumbinary accretion variability out of 625 quasars, it suggests that future large, sensitive synoptic surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time may be able to detect hundreds to thousands of candidate BSBHs from circumbinary accretion with direct implications for Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.500.4025L
The effect of a magnetic field on the dynamics of debris discs around white dwarfs;;Observational estimates of the lifetimes and inferred accretion rates from debris discs around polluted white dwarfs are often inconsistent with the predictions of models of shielded Poynting-Robertson drag on the dust particles in the discs. Moreover, many cool polluted white dwarfs do not show any observational evidence of accompanying discs. This may be explained, in part, if the debris discs had shorter lifetimes and higher accretion rates than predicted by Poynting-Robertson drag alone. We consider the role of a magnetic field on tidally disrupted diamagnetic debris and its subsequent effect on the formation, evolution, and accretion rate of a debris disc. We estimate that magnetic field strengths greater than ∼10 kG may decrease the time needed for circularization and the disc lifetimes by several orders of magnitude and increase the associated accretion rates by a similar factor, relative to Poynting-Robertson drag. We suggest some polluted white dwarfs may host magnetic fields below the typical detectable limit and that these fields may account for a proportion of polluted white dwarfs with missing debris discs. We also suggest that diamagnetic drag may account for the higher accretion rate estimates among polluted white dwarfs that cannot be predicted solely by Poynting-Robertson drag and find a dependence on magnetic field strength, orbital pericentre distance, and particle size on predicted disc lifetimes and accretion rates.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.500.2986H
Discovery and follow-up of ASASSN-19dj: an X-ray and UV luminous TDE in an extreme post-starburst galaxy;;We present observations of ASASSN-19dj, a nearby tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered in the post-starburst galaxy KUG 0810+227 by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) at a distance of d ≃ 98 Mpc. We observed ASASSN-19dj from -21 to 392 d relative to peak ultraviolet (UV)/optical emission using high-cadence, multiwavelength spectroscopy and photometry. From the ASAS-SN g-band data, we determine that the TDE began to brighten on 2019 February 6.8 and for the first 16 d the rise was consistent with a flux ∝t<SUP>2</SUP> power law. ASASSN-19dj peaked in the UV/optical on 2019 March 6.5 (MJD = 58548.5) at a bolometric luminosity of L = (6.2 ± 0.2) × 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Initially remaining roughly constant in X-rays and slowly fading in the UV/optical, the X-ray flux increased by over an order of magnitude ~225 d after peak, resulting from the expansion of the X-ray emitting region. The late-time X-ray emission is well fitted by a blackbody with an effective radius of ~1 × 10<SUP>12</SUP> cm and a temperature of ~6 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> K. The X-ray hardness ratio becomes softer after brightening and then returns to a harder state as the X-rays fade. Analysis of Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey images reveals a nuclear outburst roughly 14.5 yr earlier with a smooth decline and a luminosity of L<SUB>V</SUB> ≥ 1.4 × 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, although the nature of the flare is unknown. ASASSN-19dj occurred in the most extreme post-starburst galaxy yet to host a TDE, with Lick Hδ<SUB>A</SUB> = 7.67 ± 0.17 Å.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.500.1673H
In silico design of a new Zn-triazole based metal-organic framework for CO<SUB>2</SUB> and H<SUB>2</SUB>O adsorption;;In search for future good adsorbents for CO<SUB>2</SUB> capture, a nitrogen-rich triazole-type Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) is proposed based on the rational design and theoretical molecular simulations. The structure of the proposed MOF, named Zinc Triazolate based Framework (ZTF), is obtained by replacing the amine-organic linker of MAF-66 by a triazole, and its structural parameters are deduced. We used grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations based on generic classical force fields to correctly predict the adsorption isotherms of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and H<SUB>2</SUB>O. For water adsorption in MAF-66 and ZTF, simulations revealed that the strong hydrogen bonding interactions of water with the N atoms of triazole rings of the frameworks are the main driving forces for the high adsorption uptake of water. We also show that the proposed ZTF porous material exhibits exceptional high CO<SUB>2</SUB> uptake capacity at low pressure, better than MAF-66. Moreover, the nature of the interactions between CO<SUB>2</SUB> and the MAF-66 and ZTF surface cavities was examined at the microscopic level. Computations show that the interactions occur at two different sites, consisting of Lewis acid-Lewis base interactions and hydrogen bonding, together with obvious electrostatic interactions. In addition, we investigated the influence of the presence of H<SUB>2</SUB>O molecules on the CO<SUB>2</SUB> adsorption on the ZTF MOF. GCMC simulations reveal that the addition of H<SUB>2</SUB>O molecules leads to an enhancement of the CO<SUB>2</SUB> adsorption at very low pressures but a reduction of this CO<SUB>2</SUB> adsorption at higher pressures.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JChPh.154b4303D
Binary neutron star mergers: a multi-messenger revolution;;On 17 August 2017, less than two years after the direct detection of gravitational radiation from the merger of two ~30 Msun black holes, a binary neutron star merger was identified as the source of a gravitational wave signal of ~100 s duration that occurred at less than 50 Mpc from Earth. A short GRB was independently identified in the same sky area by the Fermi and INTEGRAL satellites for high energy astrophysics, which turned out to be associated with the gravitational event. Prompt follow-up observations at all wavelengths led first to the detection of an optical and infrared source located in the spheroidal galaxy NGC4993 and, with a delay of ~10 days, to the detection of radio and X-ray signals. This paper revisits these observations and focusses on the early optical/infrared source, which was thermal in nature and powered by the radioactive decay of the unstable isotopes of elements synthesized via rapid neutron capture during the merger and in the phases immediately following it. The far-reaching consequences of this event for cosmic nucleosynthesis and for the history of heavy elements formation in the Universe are also illustrated.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021FrASS...7..108P
Molecular-level behavior of imidazolium-based ionic liquid mixtures;;Understanding the molecular-level organization of anions and cations in a mixture of different ionic liquids (ILs) is challenging, but it can be very important for designing solvents and IL-based membrane materials. Here, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to understand the intermolecular interactions and structuring of both neat and mixed IL compositions containing 1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium [ZMIM<SUP>+</SUP>], 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium [BMIM<SUP>+</SUP>], bistriflimide [Tf<SUB>2</SUB>N<SUP>-</SUP>], and tetrafluoroborate [BF<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>-</SUP>]. We observe very strong underlying molecular-level migrations in these mixtures, and this tends to mainly involve the anion species. As compared to the systems with a single anion, the mixed anions lead to large increases/decreases in the radial distribution function peak heights, whereas the cation mixing is relatively benign. The [BF<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>-</SUP>] anions have a strong tendency to displace the [Tf<SUB>2</SUB>N<SUP>-</SUP>] anions in the mixtures, and this is seen with respect to both [BMIM<SUP>+</SUP>] and [ZMIM<SUP>+</SUP>].;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ChEnS.22916073S
GW190521 May Be an Intermediate-mass Ratio Inspiral;;GW190521 is the first confident observation of a binary black hole merger with total mass $M 100\,{M}_{\odot }$ . Given the lack of observational constraints at these masses, we analyze GW190521 considering two different priors for the binary's masses: uniform in mass ratio and source-frame total mass, and uniform in source-frame component masses. For the uniform in mass-ratio prior, we find that the component masses are ${m}_{1}^{\mathrm{src}}={168}_{-61}^{+15}\,{M}_{\odot }$ and ${m}_{2}^{\mathrm{src}}={16}_{-3}^{+33}\,{M}_{\odot }$ . The uniform in component-mass prior yields a bimodal posterior distribution. There is a low-mass-ratio mode ( $q 4$ ) with ${m}_{1}^{\mathrm{src}}={100}_{-18}^{+17}\,{M}_{\odot }$ and ${m}_{2}^{\mathrm{src}}={57}_{-16}^{+17}\,{M}_{\odot }$ and a high-mass-ratio mode ( $q\geqslant 4$ ) with ${m}_{1}^{\mathrm{src}}={166}_{-35}^{+16}\,{M}_{\odot }$ and ${m}_{2}^{\mathrm{src}}={16}_{-3}^{+14}\,{M}_{\odot }$ . Although the two modes have nearly equal posterior probability, the maximum-likelihood parameters are in the high-mass-ratio mode, with ${m}_{1}^{\mathrm{src}}=171\,{M}_{\odot }$ and ${m}_{2}^{\mathrm{src}}=16\,{M}_{\odot }$ , and a signal-to-noise ratio of 16. These results are consistent with the proposed "mass gap" produced by pair-instability in supernovae. Our results differ from those published in Abbott et al. We find that a combination of the prior used and the constraints applied may have prevented that analysis from sampling the high-mass-ratio mode. An accretion flare in AGN J124942.3+344929 was observed in possible coincidence with GW190521 by the Zwicky Transient Facility. We report parameters assuming a common origin; however, the spatial agreement of GW190521 and the electromagnetic flare alone does not provide convincing evidence for the association ( $\mathrm{ln}{ \mathcal B }rsim -4$ ).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...907L...9N
Deep Optical Observations Contemporaneous with Emission from the Periodic FRB 180916.J0158+65;;We present deep Apache Point Observatory optical observations within seconds of radio emission from the periodic fast radio burst (FRB) 180916.J0158+65 obtained on 2020 September 3. FRB 180916.J0158+65 is located in a nearby spiral galaxy 150 Mpc away and has an "active phase" with a well-measured period of approximately 16.3 days. Targeting the FRB at the peak of its expected active phase and during a recent 30 minute observing window by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) in which a radio burst was detected, we did not detect any transient optical emission at ${m}_{i}$ ≈ 24.7 mag (3σ) from 2.2 to 1938.1 s after the burst arrival time in optical bands (corrected for dispersion). Comparing our limiting magnitudes to models of a synchrotron maser formed in the circumburst environment of FRB 180916+J0158.65, we constrain scenarios where the burst energy was $ {10}^{44}$ erg and the circumburst density was >10<SUP>4</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...907L...3K
The Early Discovery of SN 2017ahn: Signatures of Persistent Interaction in a Fast-declining Type II Supernova;;We present high-cadence, comprehensive data on the nearby (D ≃ 33 Mpc) Type II supernova (SN II) 2017ahn, discovered within about one day of the explosion, from the very early phases after explosion to the nebular phase. The observables of SN 2017ahn show a significant evolution over the ≃470 days of our follow-up campaign, first showing prominent, narrow Balmer lines and other high-ionization features purely in emission (i.e., flash spectroscopy features), which progressively fade and lead to a spectroscopic evolution similar to that of more canonical SNe II. Over the same period, the decline of the light curves in all bands is fast, resembling the photometric evolution of linearly declining H-rich core-collapse SNe. The modeling of the light curves and early flash spectra suggests that a complex circumstellar medium surrounds the progenitor star at the time of explosion, with a first dense shell produced during the very late stages of its evolution that is swept up by the rapidly expanding ejecta within the first ∼6 days of the SN evolution, while signatures of interaction are observed also at later phases. Hydrodynamical models support the scenario in which linearly declining SNe II are predicted to arise from massive yellow super- or hypergiants depleted of most of their hydrogen layers.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...907...52T
Neutron Star Mergers in Active Galactic Nucleus Accretion Disks: Cocoon and Ejecta Shock Breakouts;;Neutron star mergers are believed to occur in accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Here we show that a putative jet launched from the merger of a binary neutron star (BNS) or a neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger occurring at the migration trap in an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk would be choked. The jet energy is deposited within the disk materials to power a hot cocoon. The cocoon is energetic enough to break out from the AGN disk and produce a bright X-ray shock breakout transient peaking at ∼0.15 days after the merger. The peak luminosity is estimated as $\sim {10}^{46}\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ , which can be discovered by the Einstein Probe from $z\lesssim 0.5$ . Later on, the nonrelativistic ejecta launched from the merger would break out the disk, powering an X-ray/UV flare peaking at ∼0.5 days after the merger. This second shock breakout signal may be detected by UV transient searches. The cocoon cooling emission and kilonova emission are outshone by the disk emission and are difficult to detect. Future joint observations of gravitational waves from BNS/NSBH mergers and associated two shock breakout signatures can provide strong support for the compact binary coalescence formation channel in AGN disks.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...906L..11Z
Can the Helium-detonation Model Explain the Observed Diversity of Type Ia Supernovae?;;We study a sample of 16 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) having both spectroscopic and photometric observations within 2-3 days after the first light. The early B - V colors of such a sample tend to show a continuous distribution. For objects with normal ejecta velocity (NV), the C II λ6580 feature is always visible in the early spectra, while it is absent or very weak in the high-velocity (HV) counterpart. Moreover, the velocities of the detached high-velocity features (HVFs) of the Ca II near-IR triplet (CaIR3) above the photosphere are found to be much higher in HV objects than in NV objects, with typical values exceeding 30,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> at 2-3 days. We further analyze the relation between the velocity shift of late-time [Fe II] lines (v<SUB>[Fe II]</SUB>) and host galaxy mass. We find that all HV objects have redshifted v<SUB>[Fe II]</SUB>, while NV objects have both blue- and redshifted v<SUB>[Fe II]</SUB>. It is interesting to point out that the objects with redshifted v<SUB>[Fe II]</SUB> are all located in massive galaxies, implying that HV and a portion of NV objects may have similar progenitor metallicities and explosion mechanisms. We propose that, with a geometric/projected effect, the He-detonation model may account for the similarity in birthplace environment and the differences seen in some SNe Ia, including B - V colors, C II features, CaIR3 HVFs at early times, and v<SUB>[Fe II]</SUB> in the nebular phase. Nevertheless, some features predicted by He-detonation simulation, such as the rapidly decreasing light curve, deviate from the observations, and some NV objects with blueshifted nebular v<SUB>[Fe II]</SUB> may involve other explosion mechanisms.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...906...99L
Supernova 2018cuf: A Type IIP Supernova with a Slow Fall from Plateau;;We present multiband photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2018cuf, a Type IIP ("P" for plateau) supernova (SN) discovered by the Distance Less Than 40 Mpc Survey within 24 hr of explosion. SN 2018cuf appears to be a typical SN IIP, with an absolute V-band magnitude of -16.73 ± 0.32 at maximum and a decline rate of 0.21 ± 0.05 mag/50 days during the plateau phase. The distance of the object was constrained to be 41.8 ± 5.7 Mpc by using the expanding photosphere method. We used spectroscopic and photometric observations from the first year after the explosion to constrain the progenitor of SN 2018cuf using both hydrodynamic light-curve modeling and late-time spectroscopic modeling. The progenitor of SN 2018cuf was most likely a red supergiant of about 14.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> that produced 0.04 ± 0.01 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> <SUP>56</SUP>Ni during the explosion. We also found ∼0.07 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of circumstellar material (CSM) around the progenitor is needed to fit the early light curves, where the CSM may originate from presupernova outbursts. During the plateau phase, high-velocity features at ∼11,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> were detected in both the optical and near-infrared spectra, supporting the possibility that the ejecta were interacting with some CSM. A very shallow slope during the postplateau phase was also observed, and it is likely due to a low degree of nickel mixing or the relatively high nickel mass in the SN.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...906...56D
AT 2020iko: A WZ Sge-type Dwarf Nova Candidate with an Anomalous Precursor Event;;The ongoing Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey is generating a massive alert rate from a variety of optical transients and variable stars, which are being filtered down to subsets meeting user-specified criteria by broker systems such as the Arizona-NOIRLab Temporal Analysis and Response to Events System (ANTARES). In a beta implementation of the algorithm of Soraisam et al. on ANTARES, we flagged AT 2020iko from the ZTF real-time alert stream as an anomalous source. This source is located close to a red extended Sloan Digital Sky Survey source. In the first few epochs of detection, it exhibited a V-shaped brightness profile, preceded by nondetections both in ZTF and in the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae extending to 2014. Its full light curve shows a precursor event, followed by a main superoutburst and at least two rebrightenings. A low-resolution spectrum of this source points to a dwarf nova (DN) nature. Although some of the features of AT 2020iko indicate an SU UMa-type DN, its large amplitude, presence of rebrightenings, and inferred supercycle period of ≥6 yr are in favor of AT 2020iko being a new WZ Sge-type DN candidate, a subset of rare DNe consisting of extreme mass-ratio (<0.1) binaries with an orbital period around the period minimum. The precusor event of AT 2020iko brightened by 6.5 mag, while its decay spanned 3-5 mag. We speculate this superoutburst is associated with a less expanded accretion disk than in typical superoutbursts in WZ Sge systems, with the large depth of the precursor decay implying an extremely small mass ratio. To the best of our knowledge, such a precursor event has not been recorded for any DN. This result serves to demonstrate the efficacy of our real-time anomaly search algorithm.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....161...15S
Multi-band behaviour of the TeV blazar PG 1553+113 in optical range on diverse timescales. Flux and spectral variations;;Context. The TeV BL Lac object <ASTROBJ>PG 1553+113</ASTROBJ> is one of the primary candidates for a binary supermassive black hole system. 
 Aims: We study the flux and spectral variability of <ASTROBJ>PG 1553+113</ASTROBJ> on intra-night to long-term timescales using (i) BVRI data collected over 76 nights from January 2016 to August 2019 involving nine optical telescopes and (ii) historical VR data (including ours) obtained for the period from 2005 to 2019. 
 Methods: We analysed the light curves using various statistical tests, fitting and cross-correlation techniques, and methods for the search for periodicity. We examined the colour-magnitude diagrams before and after the corresponding light curves were corrected for the long-term variations. 
 Results: Our intra-night monitoring, supplemented with literature data, result in a low duty cycle of ∼(10-18)%. In April 2019, we recorded a flare, which marks the brightest state of <ASTROBJ>PG 1553+113</ASTROBJ> for the period from 2005 to 2019: R ≃ 13.2 mag. This flare is found to show a clockwise spectral hysteresis loop on its VR colour-magnitude diagram and a time lag in the sense that the V-band variations lead the R-band ones. We obtain estimates of the radius, the magnetic field strength, and the electron energy that characterize the emission region related to the flare. We find a median period of (2.21 ± 0.04) years using the historical light curves. In addition, we detect a secondary period of about 210 days using the historical light curves corrected for the long-term variations. We briefly discuss the possible origin of this period. 

Calibrated BVRI light curves of PG 1553+113 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/645/A137">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/645/A137</A>;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...645A.137A
Multimessenger constraints on the neutron-star equation of state and the Hubble constant;;Observations of neutron-star mergers with distinct messengers, including gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals, can be used to study the behavior of matter denser than an atomic nucleus and to measure the expansion rate of the Universe as quantified by the Hubble constant. We performed a joint analysis of the gravitational-wave event GW170817 with its electromagnetic counterparts AT2017gfo and GRB170817A, and the gravitational-wave event GW190425, both originating from neutron-star mergers. We combined these with previous measurements of pulsars using x-ray and radio observations, and nuclear-theory computations using chiral effective field theory, to constrain the neutron-star equation of state. We found that the radius of a 1.4-solar mass neutron star is 11.75-0.81+0.86 km at 90% confidence and the Hubble constant is 66.2-4.2+4.4 at 1σ uncertainty.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020Sci...370.1450D
Search for high energy γ-rays from the direction of the candidate electromagnetic counterpart to the binary black hole merger gravitational-wave event S190521g;;The gravitational-wave event S190521g - a likely binary black hole merger in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus - was accompanied by an optical counterpart. Such dense environments around luminous energy release regions are favorable for high energy γ-ray production. We report on a search for high energy γ-rays from the direction of the candidate electromagnetic counterpart to the S190521g event using publicly-available data of the Fermi-LAT space γ-ray telescope. No significant signal was found. We present upper limits on the spectral energy distribution of the source in the 100 MeV-300 GeV energy range. We discuss the importance of studying S190521g-like transients in the context of cosmic ray acceleration, γ-ray and neutrino production in such sources.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ResPh..1903579P
Black hole-neutron star coalescence: Effects of the neutron star spin on jet launching and dynamical ejecta mass;;Black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers are thought to be sources of gravitational waves (GWs) with coincident electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. To further probe whether these systems are viable progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) and kilonovas, and how one may use (the lack of) EM counterparts associated with LIGO/Virgo candidate BHNS GW events to sharpen parameter estimation, we study the impact of neutron star spin in BHNS mergers. Using dynamical spacetime magnetohydrodynamic simulations of BHNSs initially on a quasicircular orbit, we survey configurations that differ in the BH spin (a<SUB>BH</SUB>/M<SUB>BH</SUB>=0 and 0.75), the NS spin (a<SUB>NS</SUB>/M<SUB>NS</SUB>=-0.17 , 0, 0.23, and 0.33), and the binary mass ratio (q ≡M<SUB>BH</SUB>:M<SUB>NS</SUB>=3 ∶1 and 5 ∶1 ). The general trend we find is that increasing the NS prograde spin increases both the rest mass of the accretion disk onto the remnant black hole, and the rest mass of dynamically ejected matter. By a time Δ t ∼3500 - 5500 M ∼88 - 138 (M<SUB>NS</SUB>/1.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) ms after the peak gravitational-wave amplitude, a magnetically driven jet is launched only for q =3 ∶1 regardless of the initial NS spin. The lifetime of the jets [Δ t ∼0.5 - 0.8 (M<SUB>NS</SUB>/1.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) s ] and their outgoing Poynting luminosity [L<SUB>Poyn</SUB>∼10<SUP>51.5 ±0.5</SUP> erg /s ] are consistent with typical SGRBs' luminosities and expectations from the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. By the time we terminate our simulations, we do not observe either an outflow or a large-scale magnetic-field collimation for the other systems we consider. The mass range of dynamically ejected matter is 10<SUP>-4.5</SUP>- 10<SUP>-2</SUP>(M<SUB>NS</SUB>/1.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) M<SUB>⊙</SUB> , which can power kilonovas with peak bolometric luminosities L<SUB>knova</SUB>∼10<SUP>40</SUP>- 10<SUP>41.4</SUP> erg /s with rise times ≲6.5 h and potentially detectable by the LSST.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhRvD.102l4077R
Modified gravity and the black hole mass gap;;We pioneer the black hole mass gap as a powerful new tool for constraining modified gravity theories. These theories predict fifth forces that alter the structure and evolution of population-III stars, exacerbating the pair-instability. This results in the formation of lighter astrophysical black holes and lowers both the upper and lower edges of the mass gap. These effects are explored using detailed numerical simulations to derive quantitative predictions that can be used as theoretical inputs for Bayesian data analysis. We discuss detection strategies in light of current and upcoming data as well as complications that may arise due to environmental screening. To demonstrate the constraining power of the mass gap, we present a novel test of the strong equivalence principle where we apply our results to an analysis of the first ten LIGO/Virgo binary black hole merger events to obtain a 7% bound on the relative difference between the gravitational constant experienced by baryonic matter, and that experienced by black holes, Δ G /G . The recent GW190521 event resulting from two black holes with masses in the canonical mass gap can be explained by modified gravity if the event originated from an unscreened galaxy where the strength of gravity is either enhanced or reduced by ∼30 % relative to its strength in the Solar System.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhRvD.102l4018S
Impact of neutrino pair-production rates in core-collapse supernovae;;In this paper, we present a careful study on the impact of neutrino pair-production on core-collapse supernovae via spherically-symmetric, general-relativistic simulations of two different massive star progenitors with energy-dependent neutrino transport. We explore the impact and consequences of both the underlying microphysics and the implementation in the radiation transport algorithms on the supernova evolution, neutrino signal properties, and the explosion dynamics. We consider the two dominant neutrino pair-production processes found in supernovae, electron-positron annihilation as well as nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung in combination with both a simplified and a complete treatment of the processes in the radiation transport algorithms. We find that the use of the simplified prescription quantitatively impacts the neutrino signal at the 10% level and potentially the supernova dynamics, as we show for the case of a zero-metallicity, 9.6 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> progenitor. We also show that the choice of nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung interaction can also have a quantitative impact on the neutrino signal. A self-consistent treatment with state-of-the-art microphysics is suggested for precision simulations of core collapse, however the simplified treatment explored here is both computationally less demanding and results in a qualitatively similar evolution.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhRvD.102l3015B
Spin and eccentricity evolution in triple systems: From the Lidov-Kozai interaction to the final merger of the inner binary;;We study the spin and eccentricity evolution of black-hole (BH) binaries that are perturbed by tertiary masses and experience the Lidov-Kozai (LK) excitation. We focus on three aspects. First, we study the spin-orbit alignment of the inner binary following the approach outlined by Antonini et al. [Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 480, L58 (2018), 10.1093/mnrasl/sly126] and Liu and Lai [Astrophys. J. 863, 68 (2018), 10.3847/1538-4357/aad09f], yet allowing the spins to have random initial orientations. We confirm the existence of a dynamical attractor that drives the spin-orbit angle at the end of the LK evolution to a value given by the initial angle between the spin and the outer orbital angular momentum (instead of to a specific value of the effective spin). Second, we follow the (inner) binary's evolution further to the merger to study the final spin-spin alignment. We generalize the effective potential theory to include orbital eccentricity, which allows us to efficiently evolve the system in the early inspiral stages. We further find that the spin-spin and spin-orbit alignments are correlated and the correlation is determined by the initial spin-orbit angle. For systems with the spin vectors initially in the orbital plane, the final spins strongly disfavor an aligned configuration and could thus lead to a greater value of the GW recoil than a uniform spin-spin alignment would predict. Lastly, we study the maximum eccentricity excitation that can be achieved during the LK process, including the effects of gravitational-wave radiation. We find that when the tertiary mass is a supermassive BH and the inner binary is massive, then even with the maximum LK excitation, the residual eccentricity is typically less than 0.1 when the binary's orbital frequency reaches 10 Hz, and a decihertz detector would be necessary to follow such a system's orbital evolution.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhRvD.102l3009Y
Convex Shape and Rotation Model of Lucy Target (11351) Leucus from Lightcurves and Occultations;;We report new photometric lightcurve observations of the Lucy Mission target (11351) Leucus acquired during the 2017, 2018, and 2019 apparitions. We use these data in combination with stellar occultations captured during five epochs to determine the sidereal rotation period, the spin axis orientation, a convex shape model, the absolute scale of the object, its geometric albedo, and a model of the photometric properties of the target. We find that Leucus is a prograde rotator with a spin axis located within a sky-projected radius of 3° (1σ) from J2000 Ecliptic coordinates (λ = 208°, β = +77°) or J2000 Equatorial Coordinates (R.A. = 248°, decl. = +58°). The sidereal period is refined to P<SUB>sid</SUB> = 445.683 ± 0.007 h. The convex shape model is irregular, with maximum dimensions of 60.8, 39.1, and 27.8 km. The convex model accounts for global features of the occultation silhouettes, although minor deviations suggest that local and global concavities are present. We determine a geometric albedo of p<SUB>V</SUB> = 0.043 ± 0.002. The derived phase curve supports a D-type classification for Leucus.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PSJ.....1...73M
Seeing-limited Imaging Sky Surveys—Small versus Large Telescopes;;Typically large telescope construction and operation costs scale up faster than their collecting area. This slows scientific progress, making it expensive and complicated to increase telescope size. We review the argument that a metric that represents the capability of an imaging survey telescopes, and that captures a wide range of science objectives, is the telescope grasp—the amount of volume of space in which a standard candle is detectable per unit time. We show that in a homogeneous Euclidean universe, and in the background-noise dominated limit, the grasp is: ${ \mathcal G }\propto {\rm{\Omega }}{A}_{\mathrm{eff}}^{3/4}{\sigma }^{-3/2}{t}_{{\rm{E}}}^{3/4}/({t}_{{\rm{E}}}+{t}_{{\rm{D}}})$ , where Ω is the telescope field of view, A<SUB>eff</SUB> is the effective collecting area of the telescope, σ is the instrumental or atmospheric seeing or the pixel-size, whichever dominates, t<SUB>E</SUB> is the exposure time, and t<SUB>D</SUB> is the dead time. In this case, the optimal exposure time is three times the dead time. We also introduce a related metric we call the information-content grasp, which summarizes the variance of all sources observed by the telescope per unit time. We show that, in the background-noise dominated regime, the information-content grasp scales like the grasp. For seeing-dominated sky surveys, in terms of grasp, étendue, or collecting-area optimization, recent technological advancements make it more cost effective to construct multiple small telescopes rather than a single large telescope with a similar grasp or étendue. Among these key advancements are the availability of large-format back-side illuminated CMOS detectors with ≲4 μm pixels, well suited to sample standard seeing conditions given typical focal lengths of small fast telescopes. We also discuss the possible use of multiple small telescopes for spectroscopy and intensity interferometers. We argue that if all the obstacles to implementing cost-effective wide-field imaging and multi-object spectrographs using multiple small telescopes are removed, then the motivation to build new single large-aperture (≳1 m) visible-light telescopes which are seeing-dominated, will be weakened. These ideas have led to the concept of the, currently under construction, Large-Array Survey Telescope.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132l5004O
The Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescopes for Survey: Overview and Performance of the System;;Over the past decade, time-domain astronomy in optical bands has developed rapidly with the operations of some wide-field survey facilities. However, most of these surveys are conducted with only a single band, and simultaneous color information is usually unavailable for the objects monitored during the survey. Here we present introductions to the system of Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescopes for Survey (TMTS), which consists of an array of four optical telescopes installed on a single equatorial mount. Such a system is designed to get multiband photometry simultaneously for stars and transients discovered during the survey. The optics of each telescope is a modified Hamilton-Newtonian system, covering the wavelengths from 400 to 900 nm, with a field of view (FoV) of about 4.5 deg<SUP>2</SUP> and a plate scale of 1"86 pixel<SUP>-1</SUP> when combining with a 4K × 4K QHY4040 CMOS detector. The TMTS system can have a FoV of about 9 deg<SUP>2</SUP> when monitoring the sky with two bands (i.e., SDSS g and r filters) at the same time, and a maximum FoV of ∼18 deg<SUP>2</SUP> when four telescopes monitor different sky areas in monochromatic filter mode. For an exposure time of 60 s, the average 3σ detection limit of the TMTS system can reach at ∼19.4 mag in Luminous filter and at ∼18.7 mag in SDSS r filter. The preliminary discovery obtained during the first few months&' survey is briefly discussed. As this telescope array is located at the Xinglong Observatory of NAOC, it can have an excellent synergy with the spectroscopic survey by the LAMOST (with a FoV of about 20 deg<SUP>2</SUP>) at the same site, which will benefit the studies of stellar and binary physics besides the transient sciences.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132l5001Z
BC Cassiopeiae: First detection of IW Andromedae-type phenomenon among post-eruption novae;;IW And-type dwarf novae are a recently recognized group of cataclysmic variables which are characterized by a sequence of brightening from a standstill-like phase with damping oscillations often followed by a deep dip. We found that the supposed classical nova BC Cas which erupted in 1929 experienced a state of an IW And-type dwarf nova in 2018, 89 yr after the eruption. This finding suggests that a high mass-transfer rate following the nova eruption is associated with the IW And-type phenomenon. The mass of the white dwarf inferred from the decline rate of the nova is considerably higher than the average mass of the white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables, and these massive white dwarfs may be responsible for the manifestation of the IW And-type phenomenon.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASJ...72...98K
A quasar microlensing event towards J1249+3449?;;We show that the optical flare event discovered by Graham et al. towards the active galactic nucleus J1249+3449 is fully consistent with being a quasar microlensing event due to a ≃0.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> star, although other explanations, such as that, mainly supported by Graham et al., of being the electromagnetic counterpart associated with a binary black hole merger, cannot be completely excluded at present.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499L..87D
CO observations towards H-=I-rich Ultradiffuse Galaxies;;We present CO observations towards a sample of six H-=I-rich Ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs) as well as one UDG (VLSB-A) in the Virgo Cluster with the Institut de RadioAstronomie Millimétrique (IRAM) 30-m telescope. CO J = 1-0 is marginally detected at 4σ level in AGC 122966, as the first detection of CO emission in UDGs. We estimate upper limits of molecular mass in other galaxies from the non-detection of CO lines. These upper limits and the marginal CO detection in AGC 122966 indicate low mass ratios between molecular and atomic gas masses. With the star formation efficiency derived from the molecular gas, we suggest that the inefficiency of star formation in such H-=I-rich UDGs is likely caused by the low efficiency in converting molecules from atomic gas, instead of low efficiency in forming stars from molecular gas.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499L..26W
Machine learning for transient recognition in difference imaging with minimum sampling effort;;The amount of observational data produced by time-domain astronomy is exponentially increasing. Human inspection alone is not an effective way to identify genuine transients from the data. An automatic real-bogus classifier is needed and machine learning techniques are commonly used to achieve this goal. Building a training set with a sufficiently large number of verified transients is challenging, due to the requirement of human verification. We present an approach for creating a training set by using all detections in the science images to be the sample of real detections and all detections in the difference images, which are generated by the process of difference imaging to detect transients, to be the samples of bogus detections. This strategy effectively minimizes the labour involved in the data labelling for supervised machine learning methods. We demonstrate the utility of the training set by using it to train several classifiers utilizing as the feature representation the normalized pixel values in 21 × 21 pixel stamps centred at the detection position, observed with the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) prototype. The real-bogus classifier trained with this strategy can provide up to $95{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ prediction accuracy on the real detections at a false alarm rate of $1{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ .;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.6009M
Cosmic rates of black hole mergers and pair-instability supernovae from chemically homogeneous binary evolution;;During the first three observing runs of the Advanced gravitational-wave detector network, the LIGO/Virgo collaboration detected several black hole binary (BHBH) mergers. As the population of detected BHBH mergers grows, it will become possible to constrain different channels for their formation. Here we consider the chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) channel in close binaries, by performing population synthesis simulations that combine realistic binary models with detailed cosmological calculations of the chemical and star-formation history of the Universe. This allows us to constrain population properties, as well as cosmological and aLIGO/aVirgo detection rates of BHBH mergers formed through this pathway. We predict a BHBH merger rate at redshift zero of $5.8 \textrm {Gpc}^{-3} \textrm {yr}^{-1}$ through the CHE channel, to be compared with aLIGO/aVirgo's measured rate of ${53.2}_{-28.2}^{+55.8} \text{Gpc}^{-3}\text{yr}^{-1}$ , and find that eventual merger systems have BH masses in the range $17{-}43 \,\textrm {M}_{\odot }$ below the pair-instability supernova (PISN) gap, and ${}124 \textrm {M}_{\odot }$ above the PISN gap. We investigate effects of momentum kicks during black hole formation, and calculate cosmological and magnitude limited PISN rates. We also study the effects of high-redshift deviations in the star formation rate. We find that momentum kicks tend to increase delay times of BHBH systems, and our magnitude limited PISN rate estimates indicate that current deep surveys should be able to detect such events. Lastly, we find that our cosmological merger rate estimates change by at most ${\sim}8{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ for mild deviations of the star formation rate in the early Universe, and by up to ${\sim}40\,\text{per cent}$ for extreme deviations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.5941D
A catalogue of over 10 million variable source candidates in ZTF Data Release 1;;Variable sources probe a wide range of astrophysical phenomena. We present a catalogue of over 10 million variable source candidates found in Data Release 1 (DR1) of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We perform a periodicity search up to a frequency of 160 d<SUP>-1</SUP>, and we classify the light curves into erratic and smooth variables. We also present variability indicators and the results of a periodicity search, up to a frequency of 5 d<SUP>-1</SUP>, for about 1 billion sources in the ZTF-DR1 light curve data base. We present several new short-period (<90 min) candidates, and about 60 new dwarf nova candidates, including two candidate eclipsing systems. Both the 10 million variables catalogue and ∼1 billion source catalogue are available online in catsHTM format.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.5782O
Swift-XRT follow-up of gravitational wave triggers during the third aLIGO/Virgo observing run;;The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory followed up 18 gravitational wave (GW) triggers from the LIGO/Virgo collaboration during the O3 observing run in 2019/2020, performing approximately 6500 pointings in total. Of these events, four were finally classified (if real) as binary black hole (BH) triggers, six as binary neutron star (NS) events, two each of NSBH and Mass Gap triggers, one an unmodelled (Burst) trigger, and the remaining three were subsequently retracted. Thus far, four of these O3 triggers have been formally confirmed as real gravitational wave events. While no likely electromagnetic counterparts to any of these GW events have been identified in the X-ray data (to an average upper limit of 3.60 × 10<SUP>-12</SUP> erg cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> over 0.3-10 keV), or at other wavelengths, we present a summary of all the Swift-XRT observations performed during O3, together with typical upper limits for each trigger observed. The majority of X-ray sources detected during O3 were previously uncatalogued; while some of these will be new (transient) sources, others are simply too faint to have been detected by earlier survey missions such as ROSAT. The all-sky survey currently being performed by eROSITA will be a very useful comparison for future observing runs, reducing the number of apparent candidate X-ray counterparts by up to 95 per cent.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.3459P
Classifying image sequences of astronomical transients with deep neural networks;;Supervised classification of temporal sequences of astronomical images into meaningful transient astrophysical phenomena has been considered a hard problem because it requires the intervention of human experts. The classifier uses the expert's knowledge to find heuristic features to process the images, for instance, by performing image subtraction or by extracting sparse information such as flux time-series, also known as light curves. We present a successful deep learning approach that learns directly from imaging data. Our method models explicitly the spatiotemporal patterns with deep convolutional neural networks and gated recurrent units. We train these deep neural networks using 1.3 million real astronomical images from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey to classify the sequences into five different types of astronomical transient classes. The TAO-Net (for Transient Astronomical Objects Network) architecture outperforms the results from random forest classification on light curves by 10 percentage points as measured by the F1 score for each class; the average F1 over classes goes from $45{{\ \rm percent}}$ with random forest classification to $55{{\ \rm percent}}$ with TAO-Net. This achievement with TAO-Net opens the possibility to develop new deep learning architectures for early transient detection. We make available the training data set and trained models of TAO-Net to allow for future extensions of this work.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.3130G
Single magnetic white dwarfs with Balmer emission lines: a small class with consistent physical characteristics as possible signposts for close-in planetary companions;;We report the identification of SDSS J121929.45+471522.8 as the third apparently isolated magnetic (B ≃ 18.5 ± 1.0 MG) white dwarf exhibiting Zeeman-split Balmer emission lines. The star shows coherent variability at optical wavelengths with an amplitude of ≃0.03 mag and a period of 15.26 h, which we interpret as the spin period of the white dwarf. Modelling the spectral energy distribution and Gaia parallax, we derive a white dwarf temperature of 7500 ± 148 K, a mass of 0.649 ± 0.022 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and a cooling age of 1.5 ± 0.1 Gyr, as well as an upper limit on the temperature of a sub-stellar or giant planet companion of ≃250 K. The physical properties of this white dwarf match very closely those of the other two magnetic white dwarfs showing Balmer emission lines: GD356 and SDSS J125230.93-023417.7. We argue that, considering the growing evidence for planets and planetesimals on close orbits around white dwarfs, the unipolar inductor model provides a plausible scenario to explain the characteristics of this small class of stars. The tight clustering of the three stars in cooling age suggests a common mechanism switching the unipolar inductor on and off. Whereas Lorentz drift naturally limits the lifetime of the inductor phase, the relatively late onset of the line emission along the white dwarf cooling sequence remains unexplained.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.2564G
Candidate periodically variable quasars from the Dark Energy Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey;;Periodically variable quasars have been suggested as close binary supermassive black holes. We present a systematic search for periodic light curves in 625 spectroscopically confirmed quasars with a median redshift of 1.8 in a 4.6 deg<SUP>2</SUP> overlapping region of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova (DES-SN) fields and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 (SDSS-S82). Our sample has a unique 20-yr long multicolour (griz) light curve enabled by combining DES-SN Y6 observations with archival SDSS-S82 data. The deep imaging allows us to search for periodic light curves in less luminous quasars (down to r ~23.5 mag) powered by less massive black holes (with masses ≳ 10<SUP>8.5</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) at high redshift for the first time. We find five candidates with significant (at >99.74 per cent single-frequency significance in at least two bands with a global p-value of ~7 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP>-3 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> accounting for the look-elsewhere effect) periodicity with observed periods of ~3-5 yr (i.e. 1-2 yr in rest frame) having ~4-6 cycles spanned by the observations. If all five candidates are periodically variable quasars, this translates into a detection rate of ${\sim }0.8^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$ per cent or ${\sim }1.1^{+0.7}_{-0.5}$ quasar per deg<SUP>2</SUP>. Our detection rate is 4-80 times larger than those found by previous searches using shallower surveys over larger areas. This discrepancy is likely caused by differences in the quasar populations probed and the survey data qualities. We discuss implications on the future direct detection of low-frequency gravitational waves. Continued photometric monitoring will further assess the robustness and characteristics of these candidate periodic quasars to determine their physical origins.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.2245C
The nature of the symbiotic candidate 2MASS J07363415+6538548 in the field of NGC 2403;;New Online Database of Symbiotic Variables includes several poorly characterized objects and candidate symbiotic stars, not only in the Milky Way but also in other galaxies. The goal of the research presented in this paper was to reveal the nature of 2MASS J07363415+6538548, the object discovered as an X-ray source in the field of NGC 2403, and tentatively classified as a symbiotic candidate or a cataclysmic variable. By analysis of available photometric data from ground-based surveys, together with a high-precision photometry from TESS, remarkable astrometric measurements of the Gaia satellite and observations of other surveys spanning from X-rays to infrared, we have found that the object neither not a symbiotic star nor a cataclysmic variable, but rather an active K-type dwarf. The star is located in the distance of 415 pc, has an effective temperature of 4275 K, luminosity of 0.14 L<SUB>⊙</SUB>, mass of 0.7 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and radius of 0.7 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>. It has a rotational period ~ 3 d and is a strong X-ray source with the X-ray luminosity of ~ $10^{30}\rm \, erg\, s^{-1}$. Gyrochronology and isochrone fitting confirmed that the star is young.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.2116M
Understanding the origin of white dwarf atmospheric pollution by dynamical simulations based on detected three-planet systems;;Between 25 and 50-= ${{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of white dwarfs (WD) present atmospheric pollution by metals, mainly by rocky material, which has been detected as gas/dust discs, or in the form of photometric transits in some WDs. Planets might be responsible for scattering minor bodies that can reach stargazing orbits, where the tidal forces of the WD can disrupt them and enhance the chances of debris to fall on to the WD surface. The planet-planet scattering process can be triggered by the stellar mass-loss during the post main-sequence (MS) evolution of planetary systems. In this work, we continue the exploration of the dynamical instabilities that can lead to WD pollution. In a previous work, we explored two-planet systems found around MS stars and here we extend the study to three-planet system architectures. We evolved 135 detected three-planet systems orbiting MS stars to the WD phase by scaling their orbital architectures in a way that their dynamical properties are preserved using the N-body integrator package MERCURY. We find that 100 simulations (8.6-= ${{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ ) are dynamically active (having planet losses, orbit crossing, and scattering) on the WD phase, where low-mass planets (1-100 M<SUB>⊕</SUB>) tend to have instabilities in Gyr time-scales, while high-mass planets (>100 M<SUB>⊕</SUB>) decrease the dynamical events more rapidly as the WD ages. Besides, 19 simulations (1.6-= ${{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ ) were found to have planets crossing the Roche radius of the WD, where 9 of them had planet-star collisions. Our three-planet simulations have a slight increase in percentage of simulations that may contribute to the WD pollution than the previous study involving two-planet systems and have shown that planet-planet scattering is responsible of sending planets close to the WD, where they may collide directly to the WD, become tidally disrupted or circularize their orbits, hence producing pollution on the WD atmosphere.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.1854M
Neutron star mergers and how to study them;;Neutron star mergers are the canonical multimessenger events: they have been observed through photons for half a century, gravitational waves since 2017, and are likely to be sources of neutrinos and cosmic rays. Studies of these events enable unique insights into astrophysics, particles in the ultrarelativistic regime, the heavy element enrichment history through cosmic time, cosmology, dense matter, and fundamental physics. Uncovering this science requires vast observational resources, unparalleled coordination, and advancements in theory and simulation, which are constrained by our current understanding of nuclear, atomic, and astroparticle physics. This review begins with a summary of our current knowledge of these events, the expected observational signatures, and estimated detection rates for the next decade. I then present the key observations necessary to advance our understanding of these sources, followed by the broad science this enables. I close with a discussion on the necessary future capabilities to fully utilize these enigmatic sources to understand our universe.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020LRR....23....4B
Preparation of egg white@zeolitic imidazolate framework-8@polyacrylic acid aerogel and its adsorption properties for organic dyes;;The egg white@zeolitic imidazolate framework-8@polyacrylic acid (EW@ZIF-8@PAA) aerogel was prepared by using in-situ polymerization of acrylic acid and freezing and freeze drying, with egg white and ZIF-8 as raw materials and 1, 4-butanediol as crosslinking agent. The aerogel possess irregular porous structure and exhibits good stability in water. The aerogel applied in the adsorption of organic dyes shows the adsorption for malachite green (MG), crystal violet (CV), methyl orange (MO) and rhodamine B (RB), which has excellent adsorption capacity for malachite green, and the maximum adsorption capacity is 2764.9 mg/g. The kinetic data of four dyes all conform to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The adsorbent still has a certain activity after five adsorption-desorption cycles.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020JSSCh.29221656W
Merged white dwarfs and nucleosynthesis;;Orbital decay mechanisms argue that double white dwarf mergers are inevitable, but extremely rare. Whilst some mergers result in explosions, the survivors re-ignite helium and burn brightly for tens of thousands or millions of years. Candidate survivors include extreme helium stars, R CrB variables and various classes of helium-rich subluminous star. Nuclear waste on the survivors' surfaces provides evidence of the stars' nuclear history prior to and their nucleosynthesis during the merger. Extensive and deep spectroscopic surveys offer rich prospects for future discoveries.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020JApA...41...48J
Generalized absurdly benign traversable wormholes powered by Casimir energy;;In this work, we explore the connection between Casimir energy and an Absurdly Benign Traversable Wormhole, which in the literature has been considered only in the pioneering paper of Morris and Thorne. To have consistency with the Casimir source, we need to generalize the idea of an Absurdly Benign Traversable Wormhole into a Generalized Absurdly Benign Traversable Wormhole. With this generalization, we have found that the wormhole throat is not more Planckian, but huge. Three profiles have been studied: one of them is directly connected with the Casimir source, while the other two have been obtained approximating the first one close to the throat. In all profiles the wormhole throat size is predicted to be of the order of 10<SUP>17</SUP>m . This huge size can be fine tuned by modulating the original Casimir energy source size. We have also found that the traceless and divergenceless property of the original Casimir stress energy tensor is here partially reproduced.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020EPJC...80.1172G
Detecting shock waves in non-fundamental mode RR Lyrae using large sample of spectra in SDSS and LAMOST;;Steps toward the nature inside RR Lyrae variables can not only improve our understanding of variable stars but also innovate the precision when we use them as tracers to map the structure of the universe. In this work, we develop a hand-crafted one-dimensional pattern recognition pipeline to fetch out the "first apparitions", the most prominent observational characteristic of shock. We report the first detection of hydrogen emission lines in the first-overtone and multi-mode RR Lyrae variables. We find that there is an anti-correlation between the intensity and the radial velocity of the emission signal, which is possibly caused by opacity changing in the helium ionization zone. Moreover, we find one RRd star with hydrogen emission that possibly shows Blazhko-type modulations. According to our discoveries, with an enormous volume of upcoming data releases of variable stars and spectra, it may become possible to build up the bridge between shock waves and big problems like the Blazhko effect in non-fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020CoBAO..67..181D
An Early-warning System for Electromagnetic Follow-up of Gravitational-wave Events;;Binary neutron stars (BNSs) will spend ≃10-15 minutes in the band of Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo detectors at design sensitivity. Matched-filtering of gravitational-wave (GW) data could in principle accumulate enough signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) to identify a forthcoming event tens of seconds before the companions collide and merge. Here we report on the design and testing of an early-warning GW detection pipeline. Early-warning alerts can be produced for sources that are at low enough redshift so that a large enough S/N accumulates ∼10-60 s before merger. We find that about 7% (49%) of the total detectable BNS mergers will be detected 60 s (10 s) before the merger. About 2% of the total detectable BNS mergers will be detected before merger and localized to within 100 deg<SUP>2</SUP> (90% credible interval). Coordinated observing by several wide-field telescopes could capture the event seconds before or after the merger. LIGO-Virgo detectors at design sensitivity could facilitate observing at least one event at the onset of merger.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905L..25S
An 8.8 Minute Orbital Period Eclipsing Detached Double White Dwarf Binary;;We report the discovery of ZTF J2243+5242, an eclipsing double white dwarf binary with an orbital period of just 8.8 minutes, the second known eclipsing binary with an orbital period of less than 10 minutes. The system likely consists of two low-mass white dwarfs and will merge in approximately 400,000 yr to form either an isolated hot subdwarf or an R Coronae Borealis star. Like its 6.91 minute counterpart, ZTF J1539+5027, ZTF J2243+5242 will be among the strongest gravitational-wave sources detectable by the space-based gravitational-wave detector the Laser Space Interferometer Antenna (LISA) because its gravitational-wave frequency falls near the peak of LISA's sensitivity. Based on its estimated distance of $d={2425}_{-114}^{+108}\,\mathrm{pc}$ , LISA should detect the source within its first few months of operation and achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 63 ± 7 after 4 yr. We find component masses of ${M}_{A}={0.323}_{-0.047}^{+0.065}$ and ${M}_{B}={0.335}_{-0.054}^{+0.052}\,{M}_{\odot }$ , radii of ${R}_{A}={0.0298}_{-0.0012}^{+0.0013}$ and ${R}_{B}={0.0275}_{-0.0013}^{+0.0012}\,{R}_{\odot }$ , and effective temperatures of ${T}_{A}={26,300}_{-900}^{+1700}$ and ${T}_{B}={19,200}_{-900}^{+1500}\,{\rm{K}}$ . We determine all of these properties and the distance to this system using only photometric measurements, demonstrating a feasible way to estimate parameters for the large population of optically faint (r > 21 m<SUB>AB</SUB>) gravitational-wave sources that the Vera Rubin Observatory and LISA should identify.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905L...7B
Application of The Wind-driven Model to a Sample of Tidal Disruption Events;;An origin of the optical/ultraviolet (UV) radiation from tidal disruption events (TDEs) has recently been discussed for different scenarios, but observational support is generally lacking. In this Letter, we test the applicability of the "wind-driven model" for a sample of UV/optical TDEs. With the model, we aim to derive the physical properties of the optical/UV TDEs, such as mass-loss rates and characteristic radii. The model assumes optically thick continuous outflows like stellar winds, and one key question arises: how is the wind-launched radius connected to physical processes in TDEs? Here we propose one possibility: through a comparison between the escape velocities estimated from their black hole masses and the wind velocities estimated from observed line widths, the outflow is launched from the self-interaction radius (R<SUB>SI</SUB>) where the stellar debris stretched by the tidal force intersects. We show that the escape velocities at R<SUB>SI</SUB> are roughly consistent with the wind velocities. By applying the model to a sample of optical/UV TDE candidates, we find that explosive mass ejections (≳10 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) from R<SUB>SI</SUB> (∼10<SUP>14</SUP> cm) can explain the observed properties of TDEs around peak luminosity. We also apply the same framework to a peculiar transient, AT2018cow. This model suggests that AT2018cow is likely a TDE induced by an intermediate-mass black hole (M<SUB>BH</SUB> ∼ 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905L...5U
Kilonova Luminosity Function Constraints Based on Zwicky Transient Facility Searches for 13 Neutron Star Merger Triggers during O3;;We present a systematic search for optical counterparts to 13 gravitational wave (GW) triggers involving at least one neutron star during LIGO/Virgo's third observing run (O3). We searched binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star black hole (NSBH) merger localizations with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and undertook follow-up with the Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) collaboration. The GW triggers had a median localization area of 4480 deg<SUP>2</SUP>, a median distance of 267 Mpc, and false-alarm rates ranging from 1.5 to 10<SUP>-25</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The ZTF coverage in the g and r bands had a median enclosed probability of 39%, median depth of 20.8 mag, and median time lag between merger and the start of observations of 1.5 hr. The O3 follow-up by the GROWTH team comprised 340 UltraViolet/Optical/InfraRed (UVOIR) photometric points, 64 OIR spectra, and three radio images using 17 different telescopes. We find no promising kilonovae (radioactivity-powered counterparts), and we show how to convert the upper limits to constrain the underlying kilonova luminosity function. Initially, we assume that all GW triggers are bona fide astrophysical events regardless of false-alarm rate and that kilonovae accompanying BNS and NSBH mergers are drawn from a common population; later, we relax these assumptions. Assuming that all kilonovae are at least as luminous as the discovery magnitude of GW170817 (-16.1 mag), we calculate that our joint probability of detecting zero kilonovae is only 4.2%. If we assume that all kilonovae are brighter than -16.6 mag (the extrapolated peak magnitude of GW170817) and fade at a rate of 1 mag day<SUP>-1</SUP> (similar to GW170817), the joint probability of zero detections is 7%. If we separate the NSBH and BNS populations based on the online classifications, the joint probability of zero detections, assuming all kilonovae are brighter than -16.6 mag, is 9.7% for NSBH and 7.9% for BNS mergers. Moreover, no more than <57% (<89%) of putative kilonovae could be brighter than -16.6 mag assuming flat evolution (fading by 1 mag day<SUP>-1</SUP>) at the 90% confidence level. If we further take into account the online terrestrial probability for each GW trigger, we find that no more than <68% of putative kilonovae could be brighter than -16.6 mag. Comparing to model grids, we find that some kilonovae must have M<SUB>ej</SUB> < 0.03 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, X<SUB>lan</SUB> > 10<SUP>-4</SUP>, or φ > 30° to be consistent with our limits. We look forward to searches in the fourth GW observing run; even 17 neutron star mergers with only 50% coverage to a depth of -16 mag would constrain the maximum fraction of bright kilonovae to <25%.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905..145K
ZTF20aajnksq (AT 2020blt): A Fast Optical Transient at z ≈ 2.9 with No Detected Gamma-Ray Burst Counterpart;;We present ZTF20aajnksq (AT 2020blt), a fast-fading (Δr = 2.3 mag in Δt = 1.3 days) red (g - r ≈ 0.6 mag) and luminous (M<SUB>1626 Å</SUB> = -25.9 mag) optical transient at z = 2.9 discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). AT 2020blt shares several features in common with afterglows to long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs): (1) an optical light curve well-described by a broken power law with a break at t<SUB>j</SUB> = 1 d (observer frame); (2) a luminous (L<SUB>0.3-10 KeV</SUB> = 10<SUP>46</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) X-ray counterpart; and (3) luminous (L<SUB>10 GHz</SUB> = 4 × 10<SUP>31</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> Hz<SUP>-1</SUP>) radio emission. However, no GRB was detected in the 0.74 days between the last ZTF nondetection (r > 21.36 mag) and the first ZTF detection (r = 19.60 mag), with an upper limit on the isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray energy release of E<SUB>γ,iso</SUB> < 7 × 10<SUP>52</SUP> erg. AT 2020blt is thus the third afterglow-like transient discovered without a detected GRB counterpart (after PTF11agg and ZTF19abvizsw) and the second (after ZTF19abvizsw) with a redshift measurement. We conclude that the properties of AT 2020blt are consistent with a classical (initial Lorentz factor Γ<SUB>0</SUB> ≳ 100) on-axis GRB that was missed by high-energy satellites. Furthermore, by estimating the rate of transients with light curves similar to that of AT 2020blt in ZTF high-cadence data, we agree with previous results that there is no evidence for an afterglow-like phenomenon that is significantly more common than classical GRBs, such as dirty fireballs. We conclude by discussing the status and future of fast-transient searches in wide-field high-cadence optical surveys.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905...98H
SuperRAENN: A Semisupervised Supernova Photometric Classification Pipeline Trained on Pan-STARRS1 Medium-Deep Survey Supernovae;;Automated classification of supernovae (SNe) based on optical photometric light-curve information is essential in the upcoming era of wide-field time domain surveys, such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) conducted by the Rubin Observatory. Photometric classification can enable real-time identification of interesting events for extended multiwavelength follow-up, as well as archival population studies. Here we present the complete sample of 5243 "SN-like" light curves (in g<SUB>P1</SUB>r<SUB>P1</SUB>i<SUB>P1</SUB>z<SUB>P1</SUB>) from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium-Deep Survey (PS1-MDS). The PS1-MDS is similar to the planned LSST Wide-Fast-Deep survey in terms of cadence, filters, and depth, making this a useful training set for the community. Using this data set, we train a novel semisupervised machine learning algorithm to photometrically classify 2315 new SN-like light curves with host galaxy spectroscopic redshifts. Our algorithm consists of an RF supervised classification step and a novel unsupervised step in which we introduce a recurrent autoencoder neural network (RAENN). Our final pipeline, dubbed SuperRAENN, has an accuracy of 87% across five SN classes (Type Ia, Ibc, II, IIn, SLSN-I) and macro-averaged purity and completeness of 66% and 69%, respectively. We find the highest accuracy rates for SNe Ia and SLSNe and the lowest for SNe Ibc. Our complete spectroscopically and photometrically classified samples break down into 62.0% Type Ia (1839 objects), 19.8% Type II (553 objects), 4.8% Type IIn (136 objects), 11.7% Type Ibc (291 objects), and 1.6% Type I SLSNe (54 objects).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905...94V
Photometric Classification of 2315 Pan-STARRS1 Supernovae with Superphot;;The classification of supernovae (SNe) and its impact on our understanding of explosion physics and progenitors have traditionally been based on the presence or absence of certain spectral features. However, current and upcoming wide-field time-domain surveys have increased the transient discovery rate far beyond our capacity to obtain even a single spectrum of each new event. We must therefore rely heavily on photometric classification—connecting SN light curves back to their spectroscopically defined classes. Here, we present Superphot, an open-source Python implementation of the machine-learning classification algorithm of Villar et al., and apply it to 2315 previously unclassified transients from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey for which we obtained spectroscopic host-galaxy redshifts. Our classifier achieves an overall accuracy of 82%, with completenesses and purities of >80% for the best classes (SNe Ia and superluminous SNe). For the worst performing SN class (SNe Ibc), the completeness and purity fall to 37% and 21%, respectively. Our classifier provides 1257 newly classified SNe Ia, 521 SNe II, 298 SNe Ibc, 181 SNe IIn, and 58 SLSNe. These are among the largest uniformly observed samples of SNe available in the literature and will enable a wide range of statistical studies of each class.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905...93H
Quasars That Have Transitioned from Radio-quiet to Radio-loud on Decadal Timescales Revealed by VLASS and FIRST;;We have performed a search over 3440 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of Epoch 1 (2017-2019) of the Very Large Array Sky Survey to identify unobscured quasars in the optical (0.2 < z < 3.2) and obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the infrared that have brightened dramatically in the radio over the past one to two decades. These sources would have been previously classified as "radio-quiet" quasars based on upper limits from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey (1993-2011), but they are now consistent with "radio-loud" quasars ( ${L}_{3\mathrm{GHz}}={10}^{40\mbox{--}42}\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ ). A quasi-simultaneous, multiband (∼1-18 GHz) follow-up study of 14 sources with the VLA has revealed compact sources (<0"1 or <1 kpc) with peaked radio spectral shapes. The high-amplitude variability over decadal timescales at 1.5 GHz (100% to >2500%) but roughly steady fluxes over a few months at 3 GHz are inconsistent with extrinsic variability due to propagation effects, thus favoring an intrinsic origin. We conclude that our sources are powerful quasars hosting compact/young jets. This challenges the generally accepted idea that "radio-loudness" is a property of the quasar/AGN population that remains fixed on human timescales. Our study suggests that frequent episodes of short-lived AGN jets that do not necessarily grow to large scales may be common at high redshift. We speculate that intermittent but powerful jets on subgalactic scales could interact with the interstellar medium, possibly driving feedback capable of influencing galaxy evolution.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905...74N
The Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe. I. Systematic Search for Calcium-rich Gap Transients Reveals Three Related Spectroscopic Subclasses;;Using the Zwicky Transient Facility alert stream, we are conducting a large spectroscopic campaign to construct a complete, volume-limited sample of transients brighter than 20 mag, and coincident within 100″ of galaxies in the Census of the Local Universe catalog. We describe the experiment design and spectroscopic completeness from the first 16 months of operations, which have classified 754 supernovae. We present results from a systematic search for calcium-rich gap transients in the sample of 22 low-luminosity (peak absolute magnitude M > -17), hydrogen-poor events found in the experiment. We report the detection of eight new events, and constrain their volumetric rate to ≳15% ± 5% of the SN Ia rate. Combining this sample with 10 previously known events, we find a likely continuum of spectroscopic properties ranging from events with SN Ia-like features (Ca-Ia objects) to those with SN Ib/c-like features (Ca-Ib/c objects) at peak light. Within the Ca-Ib/c events, we find two populations distinguished by their red (g - r ≈ 1.5 mag) or green ( $g-r\approx 0.5$ mag) colors at the r-band peak, wherein redder events show strong line blanketing features and slower light curves (similar to Ca-Ia objects), weaker He lines, and lower [Ca II]/[O I] in the nebular phase. We find that all together the spectroscopic continuum, volumetric rates, and striking old environments are consistent with the explosive burning of He shells on low-mass white dwarfs. We suggest that Ca-Ia and red Ca-Ib/c objects arise from the double detonation of He shells, while green Ca-Ib/c objects are consistent with low-efficiency burning scenarios like detonations in low-density shells or deflagrations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905...58D
High-redshift Extreme Variability Quasars from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Multiepoch Spectroscopy;;We perform a systematic search for high-redshift ( $z\, $ 1.5) extreme variability quasars (EVQs) using repeat spectra from the Sixteenth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which provides a baseline spanning up to ∼18 yr in the observed frame. We compile a sample of 348 EVQs with a maximum continuum variability at rest frame 1450 Å of more than 100% (i.e., δV ≡ (Max - Min)/Mean > 1). The EVQs show a range of emission-line variability, including 23 where at least one line in our redshift range disappears below detectability, which can then be seen as analogous to low-redshift changing-look quasars (CLQs). Importantly, spurious CLQs caused by problematic SDSS spectral flux calibration, e.g., fiber-drop issue, have been rejected. The similar properties (e.g., continuum/line, difference-composite spectra and Eddington ratio) of normal EVQs and CLQs imply that they are basically the same physical population with analogous intrinsic variability mechanisms, as a tail of a continuous distribution of normal quasar properties. In addition, we find no reliable evidence (≲1σ) to support that CLQs are a subset of EVQs with less efficient accretion. Finally, we also confirm the antibreathing of C IV (i.e., the line width increases as luminosity increases) in EVQs and find that in addition to the ∼0.4 dex systematic uncertainty in single-epoch C IV virial black hole mass estimates, an extra scatter of ∼0.3 dex will be introduced by extreme variability.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905...52G
A Systematic Search of Zwicky Transient Facility Data for Ultracompact Binary LISA-detectable Gravitational-wave Sources;;Using photometry collected with the Zwicky Transient Facility, we are conducting an ongoing survey for binary systems with short orbital periods ( ${P}_{{\rm{b}}} 1\,\mathrm{hr})$ with the goal of identifying new gravitational-wave sources detectable by the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We present a sample of 15 binary systems discovered thus far, with orbital periods ranging from 6.91 to 56.35 minutes. Of the 15 systems, seven are eclipsing systems that do not show signs of significant mass transfer. Additionally, we have discovered two AM Canum Venaticorum systems and six systems exhibiting primarily ellipsoidal variations in their lightcurves. We present follow-up spectroscopy and high-speed photometry confirming the nature of these systems, estimates of their LISA signal-to-noise ratios, and a discussion of their physical characteristics.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905...32B
Standard Candles and Sirens Rescue H<SUB>0</SUB>;;We show that future observations of binary neutron star systems with electromagnetic counterparts together with the traditional probes of low- and high-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) can help resolve the Hubble tension. The luminosity distance inferred from these probes and its scatter depend on the underlying cosmology. By using the gravitational lensing of light or gravitational waves emitted by, and peculiar motion of, these systems we derive constraints on the sum of neutrino masses, the equation of state of dark energy parameterized in the form ${w}_{0}+{w}_{a}(1-a)$ , along with the Hubble constant and cold dark matter density in the universe. We show that even after marginalizing over poorly constrained physical quantities, such as the sum of neutrino masses and the nature of dark energy, low-redshift gravitational-wave observations, in combination with SNe Ia, have the potential to rule out new physics as the underlying cause of the Hubble tension at ≳5.5σ.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...904..169A
Constraining the Kilonova Rate with Zwicky Transient Facility Searches Independent of Gravitational Wave and Short Gamma-Ray Burst Triggers;;The first binary neutron star merger, GW170817, was accompanied by a radioactivity-powered optical/infrared transient called a kilonova. To date, no compelling kilonova has been found in all-sky optical surveys, independently of short gamma-ray burst and gravitational-wave triggers. In this work, we searched the first 23 months of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data stream for candidate kilonovae in the form of rapidly evolving transients. We combined ZTF alert queries with forced point-spread-function photometry and nightly flux stacking to increase our sensitivity to faint and fast transients. Automatic queries yielded >11,200 candidates, 24 of which passed quality checks and selection criteria based on a grid of kilonova models tailored for both binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole mergers. None of the candidates in our sample was deemed a possible kilonova after thorough vetting. The sources that passed our selection criteria are dominated by Galactic cataclysmic variables. We identified two fast transients at high Galactic latitude, one of which is the confirmed afterglow of long-duration GRB 190106A, the other is a possible cosmological afterglow. Using a survey simulation code, we constrained the kilonova rate for a range of models including top-hat, linearly decaying light curves, and synthetic light curves obtained with radiative transfer simulations. For prototypical GW170817-like kilonovae, we constrain the rate to be $R 1775$ Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> (95% confidence). By assuming a population of kilonovae with the same geometry and composition of GW170817 observed under a uniform viewing angle distribution, we obtained a constraint on the rate of R < 4029 Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...904..155A
The First Extensive Spectroscopic Study of Young Stars in the North America and Pelican Nebulae;;We present a spectroscopic survey of over 3400 potential members in the North America and Pelican Nebulae (NAP) using several low-resolution (R ≈ 1300-2000) spectrographs: Palomar/Norris, WIYN/Hydra, Keck/DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS), and the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT)/Hectospec. We identify 580 young stars as likely members of the NAP region based on criteria involving infrared excess, Li I 6708 Å absorption, X-ray emission, parallax, and proper motions. The spectral types of individual spectra are derived by fitting them with templates that are either empirical spectra of pre-main-sequence stars or model atmospheres. The templates are artificially veiled, and a best-fit combination of spectral type and veiling parameter is derived for each star. We use the spectral types with archival photometry to derive V-band extinction and stellar luminosity. From the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, the median age of the young stars is about 1 Myr, with a luminosity dispersion of ∼0.3-0.4 dex. We investigate the photometric variability of the spectroscopic member sample using Zwicky Transient Facility data and conclude that photometric variability, while present, does not significantly contribute to the luminosity dispersion. While larger than the formal errors, the luminosity dispersion is smaller than if veiling were not taken into account in our spectral typing process. The measured ages of the stellar kinematic groups, combined with the inferred ages for embedded stellar populations revealed by Spitzer, suggest a sequential history of star formation in the NAP region.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...904..146F
Tidal Disruptions of Main-sequence Stars. II. Simulation Methodology and Stellar Mass Dependence of the Character of Full Tidal Disruptions;;This is the second in a series of papers presenting the results of fully general relativistic simulations of stellar tidal disruptions in which the stars' initial states are realistic main-sequence models. In the first paper, we gave an overview of this program and discussed the principal observational implications of our work. Here we describe our calculational method, which includes a new method for calculating fully relativistic stellar self-gravity, and provide details about the outcomes of full disruptions, focusing on the stellar mass dependence of the outcomes for a black hole of mass 10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We consider eight different stellar masses, from 0.15 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> to 10 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We find that, relative to the traditional order-of-magnitude estimate r<SUB>t</SUB>, the physical tidal radius of low-mass stars (M<SUB>⋆</SUB> ≲ 0.7 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) is larger by tens of percent, while for high-mass stars (M<SUB>⋆</SUB> ≳ 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) it is smaller by a factor of 2-2.5. The traditional estimate of the range of energies found in the debris is ≈1.4× too large for low-mass stars, but is a factor of ∼2 too small for high-mass stars; in addition, the energy distribution for high-mass stars has significant wings. For all stars undergoing tidal encounters, we find that mass loss continues for many stellar vibration times because the black hole's tidal gravity competes with the instantaneous stellar gravity at the star's surface until the star has reached a distance from the black hole ∼O(10)r<SUB>t</SUB>.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...904...99R
Tidal Disruptions of Main-sequence Stars. I. Observable Quantities and Their Dependence on Stellar and Black Hole Mass;;This paper introduces a series of papers presenting a quantitative theory for the tidal disruption of main-sequence stars by supermassive black holes. Using fully general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations and MESA-model initial conditions, we explore the pericenter-dependence of tidal disruption properties for eight stellar masses ( $0.15\leqslant {M}_{\star }/{M}_{\odot }\leqslant 10$ ) and six black hole masses ( ${10}^{5}\leqslant {M}_{\mathrm{BH}}/{M}_{\odot }\leqslant 5\times {10}^{7}$ ). We present here the results most relevant to observations. The effects of internal stellar structure and relativity decouple for both the disruption cross section and the characteristic energy width of the debris. Moreover, the full disruption cross section is almost independent of M<SUB>⋆</SUB> for M<SUB>⋆</SUB>/M<SUB>⊙</SUB> ≲ 3. Independent of M<SUB>⋆</SUB>, relativistic effects increase the critical pericenter distance for full disruption events by up to a factor of ∼3 relative to the Newtonian prediction. The probability of a direct capture is also independent of M<SUB>⋆</SUB>; at M<SUB>BH</SUB>/M<SUB>⊙</SUB> ≃ 5 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> this probability is equal to the probability of a complete disruption. The breadth of the debris energy distribution ΔE can differ from the standard estimate by factors of 0.35 - 2, depending on M<SUB>⋆</SUB> and M<SUB>BH</SUB>, implying a corresponding change (∝(ΔE)<SUP>-3/2</SUP>) in the characteristic mass-return timescale. We provide analytic forms, suitable for use in both event rate estimates and parameter inference, to describe all these trends. For partial disruptions, we find a nearly universal relation between the star's angular momentum and the fraction of M<SUB>⋆</SUB> remaining. Within the "empty loss-cone" regime, partial disruptions must precede full disruptions. These partial disruptions can drastically affect the rate and appearance of subsequent total disruptions.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...904...98R
Over 10000 δ Scuti Stars toward the Galactic Bulge from OGLE-IV;;We present a collection of 10 111 genuine δ Sct-type pulsating variable stars detected in the OGLE-IV Galactic bulge fields. In this sample, 9835 variables are new discoveries. For most of the stars photometric data cover the whole decade 2010-2019. We illustrate a huge variety of light curve shapes of δ Sct variables. Long-term observations have allowed us to spot objects with evident period, amplitude, and mean brightness variations. Our analysis indicates that about 28% of the stars are single-mode pulsators. Fourteen δ Sct stars show additional eclipsing or ellipsoidal binary modulation. We report significant attenuation or even disappearance of the pulsation signal in six sources. The whole set of variables is a mix of objects representing various Milky Way's populations, with the majority of stars from the Galactic bulge. There are also representatives of the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy. Some of the newly detected variables could be SX Phe-type stars residing in globular clusters. The collection, including full V- and I-band time-series data, is available to the astronomical community from the OGLE On-line Data Archive.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AcA....70..241P
An Asymmetric Eclipse Seen toward the Pre-main-sequence Binary System V928 Tau;;K2 observations of the weak-lined T Tauri binary V928 Tau A and B show the detection of a single, asymmetric eclipse, which may be due to a previously unknown substellar companion eclipsing one component of the binary with an orbital period >66 days. Over an interval of about 9 hr, one component of the binary dims by around 60%, returning to its normal brightness about 5 hr later. From modeling of the eclipse shape, we find evidence that the eclipsing companion may be surrounded by a disk or a vast ring system. The modeled disk has a radius of 0.9923 ± 0.0005 R<SUB>*</SUB>, with an inclination of 56°78 ± 0°03, a tilt of 41°22 ± 0°05, an impact parameter of -0.2506 ± 0.0002 R<SUB>*</SUB>, and an opacity of 1.00. The occulting disk must also move at a transverse velocity of 6.637 ± 0.002 R<SUB>*</SUB> day<SUP>-1</SUP>, which, depending on whether it orbits V928 Tau A or B, corresponds to approximately 73.53 or 69.26 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. A search in ground-based archival data reveals additional dimming events, some of which suggest periodicity, but no unambiguous period associated with the eclipse observed by K2. We present a new epoch of astrometry that is used to further refine the orbit of the binary, presenting a new lower bound of 67 yr, and constraints on the possible orbital periods of the eclipsing companion. The binary is also separated by 18″ (∼2250 au) from the lower-mass CFHT-BD-Tau 7, which is likely associated with V928 Tau A and B. We also present new high-dispersion optical spectroscopy that we use to characterize the unresolved stellar binary.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160..285V
Periodic Eruptive Variability of the Isolated Pre-main-sequence Star V347 Aurigae;;V347 Aurigae is associated with the small dark cloud L1438 and appears to be an isolated pre-main-sequence star located at distance d ≈ 200 pc. Multi-epoch, archival photometry reveals periodic brightness variations with amplitude V ≈ 2.0 mag occurring on timescales of ∼160 days that have persisted for decades. Regular-cadence, optical imaging of the source with the Zwicky Transient Facility shows that a small reflection nebula illuminated by V347 Aur also fluctuates in brightness, at times fading completely. Multi-epoch, Keck/HIRES data suggests the presence of two distinct spectral components: a prominent emission-line-dominated spectrum with a heavily veiled continuum correlated with the bright photometric state, and an M-type absorption line spectrum associated with quiescence. All spectra exhibit strong Balmer and He I line emission, consistent with accretion, as well as high velocity emission arising from the forbidden transitions of [O I], [N II], and [S II] that are generally associated with collimated jets and disk winds. There is no evidence in existing high-dispersion spectroscopy or high-resolution imaging for binarity of V347 Aur. The repeating outburst events are possibly linked to accretion instabilities induced by an undetected companion or a structure within the circumstellar disk that periodically increases the mass accretion rate. V347 Aur is perhaps analogous to an EXor-type variable, though more regularly recurring.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160..278D
Establishing Earth's Minimoon Population through Characterization of Asteroid 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB>;;We report on our detailed characterization of Earth's second known temporary natural satellite, or minimoon, asteroid 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB>. An artificial origin can be ruled out based on its area-to-mass ratio and broadband photometry, which suggest that it is a silicate asteroid belonging to the S or V complex in asteroid taxonomy. The discovery of 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB> allows for the first time a comparison between known minimoons and theoretical models of their expected physical and dynamical properties. The estimated diameter of ${1.2}_{-0.2}^{+0.4}$ m and geocentric capture approximately a decade after the first known minimoon, 2006 RH<SUB>120</SUB>, are in agreement with theoretical predictions. The capture duration of 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB> of at least 2.7 yr is unexpectedly long compared to the simulation average, but it is in agreement with simulated minimoons that have close lunar encounters, providing additional support for the orbital models. 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB>'s atypical rotation period, significantly longer than theoretical predictions, suggests that our understanding of meter-scale asteroids needs revision. More discoveries and a detailed characterization of the population can be expected with the forthcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160..277F
A Mini-Neptune and a Radius Valley Planet Orbiting the Nearby M2 Dwarf TOI-1266 in Its Venus Zone: Validation with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder;;We report on the validation of two planets orbiting the nearby (36 pc) M2 dwarf TOI-1266 observed by the TESS mission. This system is one of a few M dwarf multiplanet systems with close-in planets where the inner planet is substantially larger than the outer planet. The inner planet is sub-Neptune-sized (R = 2.46 ± 0.08 R<SUB>⊕</SUB>) with an orbital period of 10.9 days, while the outer planet has a radius of ${1.67}_{-0.11}^{+0.09}$ R<SUB>⊕</SUB> and resides in the exoplanet radius valley—the transition region between rocky and gaseous planets. With an orbital period of 18.8 days, the outer planet receives an insolation flux of 2.4 times that of Earth, similar to the insolation of Venus. Using precision near-infrared radial velocities with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder Spectrograph, we place upper mass limits of 15.9 and 6.4 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> at 95% confidence for the inner and outer planet, respectively. A more precise mass constraint of both planets, achievable with current radial velocity instruments given the host star brightness (V = 12.9, J = 9.7), will yield further insights into the dominant processes sculpting the exoplanet radius valley.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160..259S
Recoverability of Known Near-Earth Asteroids;;This paper analyzes the current population of known near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and presents statistics on the recoverability of NEAs with both targeted observation campaigns and all-sky surveys. For an asteroid to be observable at a future apparition, given the right geometry, the plane-of-sky uncertainty must be small enough to be covered by a telescope's field of view and the asteroid must be brighter than the detector's limiting magnitude. Since recoverability is a telescope-dependent property, we select two representative instruments that span a wide range of capability and availability: the 1.0 m I52 telescope of the Catalina Sky Survey and the Hyper Suprime-Cam of the 8.2 m Subaru telescope. Based on this choice, we classify asteroids as recoverable, potentially recoverable, and not recoverable depending on whether they could be detected with an I52-class telescope, only with a Subaru-class telescope, or with neither, respectively. Using these definitions, we find that the majority (90%) of NEAs with H < 22 and most (93%) potentially hazardous asteroids are recoverable or potentially recoverable in the next 50 yr. When considering fainter asteroids down to H ≤ 28, about two-thirds of the NEA population and half of the low minimum-orbit intersection distance (MOID) asteroids (MOID ≤ 0.05 au) are either recoverable or potentially recoverable. As of 2019 October 13, the Sentry risk list includes 193 objects with an impact probability greater than 10<SUP>-6</SUP> that are not recoverable. The fraction of NEAs and low-MOID NEAs that are not recoverable can be reduced by up to 47% and 43%, respectively, when incorporating statistical estimates of serendipitous recoveries by all-sky surveys.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160..250R
Strong dependence of Type Ia supernova standardization on the local specific star formation rate;;As part of an on-going effort to identify, understand and correct for astrophysics biases in the standardization of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) for cosmology, we have statistically classified a large sample of nearby SNe Ia into those that are located in predominantly younger or older environments. This classification is based on the specific star formation rate measured within a projected distance of 1 kpc from each SN location (LsSFR). This is an important refinement compared to using the local star formation rate directly, as it provides a normalization for relative numbers of available SN progenitors and is more robust against extinction by dust. We find that the SNe Ia in predominantly younger environments are Δ<SUB>Y</SUB> = 0.163 ± 0.029 mag (5.7σ) fainter than those in predominantly older environments after conventional light-curve standardization. This is the strongest standardized SN Ia brightness systematic connected to the host-galaxy environment measured to date. The well-established step in standardized brightnesses between SNe Ia in hosts with lower or higher total stellar masses is smaller, at Δ<SUB>M</SUB> = 0.119 ± 0.032 mag (4.5σ), for the same set of SNe Ia. When fit simultaneously, the environment-age offset remains very significant, with Δ<SUB>Y</SUB> = 0.129 ± 0.032 mag (4.0σ), while the global stellar mass step is reduced to Δ<SUB>M</SUB> = 0.064 ± 0.029 mag (2.2σ). Thus, approximately 70% of the variance from the stellar mass step is due to an underlying dependence on environment-based progenitor age. Also, we verify that using the local star formation rate alone is not as powerful as LsSFR at sorting SNe Ia into brighter and fainter subsets. Standardization that only uses the SNe Ia in younger environments reduces the total dispersion from 0.142 ± 0.008 mag to 0.120 ± 0.010 mag. We show that as environment-ages evolve with redshift, a strong bias, especially on the measurement of the derivative of the dark energy equation of state, can develop. Fortunately, data that measure and correct for this effect using our local specific star formation rate indicator, are likely to be available for many next-generation SN Ia cosmology experiments.

HOLISMOKES. II. Identifying galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses in Pan-STARRS using convolutional neural networks;;We present a systematic search for wide-separation (with Einstein radius θ<SUB>E</SUB> ≳ 1.5″), galaxy-scale strong lenses in the 30 000 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of the Pan-STARRS 3π survey on the Northern sky. With long time delays of a few days to weeks, these types of systems are particularly well-suited for catching strongly lensed supernovae with spatially-resolved multiple images and offer new insights on early-phase supernova spectroscopy and cosmography. We produced a set of realistic simulations by painting lensed COSMOS sources on Pan-STARRS image cutouts of lens luminous red galaxies (LRGs) with redshift and velocity dispersion known from the sloan digital sky survey (SDSS). First, we computed the photometry of mock lenses in gri bands and applied a simple catalog-level neural network to identify a sample of 1 050 207 galaxies with similar colors and magnitudes as the mocks. Second, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on Pan-STARRS gri image cutouts to classify this sample and obtain sets of 105 760 and 12 382 lens candidates with scores of p<SUB>CNN</SUB> > 0.5 and > 0.9, respectively. Extensive tests showed that CNN performances rely heavily on the design of lens simulations and the choice of negative examples for training, but little on the network architecture. The CNN correctly classified 14 out of 16 test lenses, which are previously confirmed lens systems above the detection limit of Pan-STARRS. Finally, we visually inspected all galaxies with p<SUB>CNN</SUB> > 0.9 to assemble a final set of 330 high-quality newly-discovered lens candidates while recovering 23 published systems. For a subset, SDSS spectroscopy on the lens central regions proves that our method correctly identifies lens LRGs at z ∼ 0.1-0.7. Five spectra also show robust signatures of high-redshift background sources, and Pan-STARRS imaging confirms one of them as a quadruply-imaged red source at z<SUB>s</SUB> = 1.185, which is likely a recently quenched galaxy strongly lensed by a foreground LRG at z<SUB>d</SUB> = 0.3155. In the future, high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic follow-up will be required to validate Pan-STARRS lens candidates and derive strong lensing models. We also expect that the efficient and automated two-step classification method presented in this paper will be applicable to the ∼4 mag deeper gri stacks from the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) with minor adjustments.

HOLISMOKES. I. Highly Optimised Lensing Investigations of Supernovae, Microlensing Objects, and Kinematics of Ellipticals and Spirals;;We present the HOLISMOKES programme on strong gravitational lensing of supernovae (SNe) as a probe of SN physics and cosmology. We investigate the effects of microlensing on early-phase SN Ia spectra using four different SN explosion models. We find that distortions of SN Ia spectra due to microlensing are typically negligible within ten rest-frame days after a SN explosion (< 1% distortion within the 1σ spread and ≲10% distortion within the 2σ spread). This shows the great prospects of using lensed SNe Ia to obtain intrinsic early-phase SN spectra for deciphering SN Ia progenitors. As a demonstration of the usefulness of lensed SNe Ia for cosmology, we simulate a sample of mock lensed SN Ia systems that are expected to have accurate and precise time-delay measurements in the era of the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Adopting realistic yet conservative uncertainties on their time-delay distances and lens angular diameter distances, of 6.6% and 5%, respectively, we find that a sample of 20 lensed SNe Ia would allow us to constrain the Hubble constant (H<SUB>0</SUB>) with 1.3% uncertainty in the flat ΛCDM cosmology. We find a similar constraint on H<SUB>0</SUB> in an open ΛCDM cosmology, while the constraint degrades to 3% in a flat wCDM cosmology. We anticipate lensed SNe to be an independent and powerful probe of SN physics and cosmology in the upcoming LSST era.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A&A...644A.162S
Euclid: Identification of asteroid streaks in simulated images using StreakDet software;;Context. The ESA Euclid space telescope could observe up to 150 000 asteroids as a side product of its primary cosmological mission. Asteroids appear as trailed sources, that is streaks, in the images. Owing to the survey area of 15 000 square degrees and the number of sources, automated methods have to be used to find them. Euclid is equipped with a visible camera, VIS (VISual imager), and a near-infrared camera, NISP (Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer), with three filters. 
 Aims: We aim to develop a pipeline to detect fast-moving objects in Euclid images, with both high completeness and high purity. 
 Methods: We tested the StreakDet software to find asteroids from simulated Euclid images. We optimized the parameters of StreakDet to maximize completeness, and developed a post-processing algorithm to improve the purity of the sample of detected sources by removing false-positive detections. 
 Results: StreakDet finds 96.9% of the synthetic asteroid streaks with apparent magnitudes brighter than 23rd magnitude and streak lengths longer than 15 pixels (10 arcsec h<SUP>-1</SUP>), but this comes at the cost of finding a high number of false positives. The number of false positives can be radically reduced with multi-streak analysis, which utilizes all four dithers obtained by Euclid. 
 Conclusions: StreakDet is a good tool for identifying asteroids in Euclid images, but there is still room for improvement, in particular, for finding short (less than 13 pixels, corresponding to 8 arcsec h<SUP>-1</SUP>) and/or faint streaks (fainter than the apparent magnitude of 23).

Strongly Lensed Supernovae in Well-Studied Galaxy Clusters with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory;;Strong lensing by galaxy clusters can be used to significantly expand the survey reach, thus allowing observation of magnified high-redshift supernovae that otherwise would remain undetected. Strong lensing can also provide multiple images of the galaxies that lie behind the clusters. Detection of strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is especially useful because of their standardizable brightness, as they can be used to improve either cluster lensing models or independent measurements of cosmological parameters. The cosmological parameter, the Hubble constant, is of particular interest given the discrepancy regarding its value from measurements with different approaches. Here, we explore the feasibility of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of detecting strongly lensed SNe in the field of five galaxy clusters (Abell 1689 and Hubble Frontier Fields clusters) that have well-studied lensing models. Considering the 88 systems composed of 268 individual multiple images in the five cluster fields, we find that the LSST will be sensitive to SNe~Ia (SNe~IIP) exploding in 41 (23) galaxy images. The range of redshift of these galaxies is between $1.01 < z < 3.05$. During its 10 years of operation, LSST is expected to detect $0.2\pm0.1$ SN~Ia and $0.9\pm0.3$ core collapse SNe. However, as LSST will observe many more massive galaxy clusters, it is likely that the expectations are higher. We stress the importance of having an additional observing program for photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of the strongly lensed SNe detected by LSST.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020Symm...12.1966P
The electromagnetic counterparts of compact binary mergers;;Mergers of binaries consisting of two neutron stars, or a black hole and a neutron star, offer a unique opportunity to study a range of physical and astrophysical processes using two different and almost orthogonal probes - gravitational waves (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) emission. The GW signal probes the binary and the physical processes that take place during the last stages of the merger, while the EM emission provides clues to the material that is thrown out following the merger. The accurate localization, which only the EM emission can provide, also indicates the astrophysical setting in which the merger took place. In addition, the combination of the two signals provides constraints on the nature of gravity and on the expansion rate of the Universe. The first detection of a binary neutron star merger by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, GW170817, initiated the era of multi-messenger GW-EM astrophysics and demonstrated the great promise it holds. The event produced an unprecedented data set, and although it was only a single event, it provided remarkable results that revolutionized our knowledge of neutron star mergers. GW170817 is especially exciting since we know that it is not one of a kind and that many more events will be detected during the next decade. In this review, I summarize, first, the theory of EM emission from compact binary mergers, highlighting the unique information that the combined GW-EM detection provides. I then describe the entire set of GW and EM observations of GW170817, and summarize the range of insights that it offers. This includes clues about the role that similar events play in the r-process elements budget of the Universe, the neutron star equation of state, the properties of the relativistic outflow that followed the merger, and the connection between neutron star binary mergers and short gamma-ray bursts. I conclude by discussing some of the future prospects of this new window that has been opened.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhR...886....1N
Evryscope-South Survey of Upper- and Pre-main Sequence Solar Neighborhood Stars;;Using photometric data collected by Evryscope-South, we search for nearby young variable systems on the upper main sequence (UMS) and pre-main sequence (PMS). The Evryscopes are all-sky high-cadence telescope arrays operating in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. We base our search on a Gaia-selected catalog of young neighborhood upper- and pre-main sequence stars which were chosen through both astrometric and photometric criteria. We analyze 44,971 Evryscope-South light curves in search of variability. We recover 615 variables, with 378 previously known, and 237 new discoveries including 84 young eclipsing binaries (EB) candidates. We discover a new highly eccentric binary system and recover a further four previously known systems, with periods ranging from 299 to 674 hr. We find 158 long-period (>50 hr) candidate EB systems, 9 from the PMS and 149 from the UMS, which will allow constraints on the mass/radius/age relation. These long-period EBs include a 179.3 hr PMS system and a 867.8 hr system from the UMS. For PMS variable candidates we estimate system ages, which range from 1 to 23 Myr for non-EBs and from 2 to 17 Myr for EBs. Other non-EB discoveries that show intrinsic variability will allow relationships between stellar rotation rates, ages, activity, and mass to be characterized.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132k4202G
SN 2018gjx reveals that some SNe Ibn are SNe IIb exploding in dense circumstellar material;;We present the data and analysis of SN 2018gjx, an unusual low-luminosity transient with three distinct spectroscopic phases. Phase I shows a hot blue spectrum with signatures of ionized circumstellar material (CSM), Phase II has the appearance of broad SN features, consistent with those seen in a Type IIb supernova at maximum light, and Phase III is that of a supernova interacting with helium-rich CSM, similar to a Type Ibn supernova. This event provides an apparently rare opportunity to view the inner workings of an interacting supernova. The observed properties can be explained by the explosion of a star in an aspherical CSM. The initial light is emitted from an extended CSM (~4000 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>), which ionizes the exterior unshocked material. Some days after, the SN photosphere envelops this region, leading to the appearance of a SN IIb. Over time, the photosphere recedes in velocity space, revealing interaction between the supernova ejecta and the CSM that partially obscures the supernova nebular phase. Modelling of the initial spectrum reveals a surface composition consistent with compact H-deficient Wolf-Rayet and Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stars. Such configurations may not be unusual, with SNe IIb being known to have signs of interaction so at least some SNe IIb and SNe Ibn may be the same phenomena viewed from different angles, or possibly with differing CSM configurations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.1450P
Density-based outlier scoring on Kepler data;;In the present era of large-scale surveys, big data present new challenges to the discovery process for anomalous data. Such data can be indicative of systematic errors, extreme (or rare) forms of known phenomena, or most interestingly, truly novel phenomena that exhibit as-of-yet unobserved behaviours. In this work, we present an outlier scoring methodology to identify and characterize the most promising unusual sources to facilitate discoveries of such anomalous data. We have developed a data mining method based on k-nearest neighbour distance in feature space to efficiently identify the most anomalous light curves. We test variations of this method including using principal components of the feature space, removing select features, the effect of the choice of k, and scoring to subset samples. We evaluate the performance of our scoring on known object classes and find that our scoring consistently scores rare (<1000) object classes higher than common classes. We have applied scoring to all long cadence light curves of Quarters 1-17 of Kepler's prime mission and present outlier scores for all 2.8 million light curves for the roughly 200k objects.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499..524G
An outflow powers the optical rise of the nearby, fast-evolving tidal disruption event AT2019qiz;;At 66 Mpc, AT2019qiz is the closest optical tidal disruption event (TDE) to date, with a luminosity intermediate between the bulk of the population and the faint-and-fast event iPTF16fnl. Its proximity allowed a very early detection and triggering of multiwavelength and spectroscopic follow-up well before maximum light. The velocity dispersion of the host galaxy and fits to the TDE light curve indicate a black hole mass ≈10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, disrupting a star of ≈1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. By analysing our comprehensive UV, optical, and X-ray data, we show that the early optical emission is dominated by an outflow, with a luminosity evolution L ∝ t<SUP>2</SUP>, consistent with a photosphere expanding at constant velocity (≳2000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), and a line-forming region producing initially blueshifted H and He II profiles with v = 3000-10 000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The fastest optical ejecta approach the velocity inferred from radio detections (modelled in a forthcoming companion paper from K. D. Alexander et al.), thus the same outflow may be responsible for both the fast optical rise and the radio emission - the first time this connection has been observed in a TDE. The light-curve rise begins 29 ± 2 d before maximum light, peaking when the photosphere reaches the radius where optical photons can escape. The photosphere then undergoes a sudden transition, first cooling at constant radius then contracting at constant temperature. At the same time, the blueshifts disappear from the spectrum and Bowen fluorescence lines (N III) become prominent, implying a source of far-UV photons, while the X-ray light curve peaks at ≈10<SUP>41</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Assuming that these X-rays are from prompt accretion, the size and mass of the outflow are consistent with the reprocessing layer needed to explain the large optical to X-ray ratio in this and other optical TDEs, possibly favouring accretion-powered over collision-powered outflow models.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499..482N
The tidal disruption event AT 2018hyz - I. Double-peaked emission lines and a flat Balmer decrement;;We present results from spectroscopic observations of AT 2018hyz, a transient discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernova survey at an absolute magnitude of M<SUB>V</SUB> ~ -20.2 mag, in the nucleus of a quiescent galaxy with strong Balmer absorption lines. AT 2018hyz shows a blue spectral continuum and broad emission lines, consistent with previous TDE candidates. High cadence follow-up spectra show broad Balmer lines and He I in early spectra, with He II making an appearance after ~70-100 d. The Balmer lines evolve from a smooth broad profile, through a boxy, asymmetric double-peaked phase consistent with accretion disc emission, and back to smooth at late times. The Balmer lines are unlike typical active galactic nucleus in that they show a flat Balmer decrement (Hα/Hβ ~ 1.5), suggesting the lines are collisionally excited rather than being produced via photoionization. The flat Balmer decrement together with the complex profiles suggests that the emission lines originate in a disc chromosphere, analogous to those seen in cataclysmic variables. The low optical depth of material due to a possible partial disruption may be what allows us to observe these double-peaked, collisionally excited lines. The late appearance of He II may be due to an expanding photosphere or outflow, or late-time shocks in debris collisions.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.498.4119S
Unsupervised machine learning for transient discovery in deeper, wider, faster light curves;;Identification of anomalous light curves within time-domain surveys is often challenging. In addition, with the growing number of wide-field surveys and the volume of data produced exceeding astronomers' ability for manual evaluation, outlier and anomaly detection is becoming vital for transient science. We present an unsupervised method for transient discovery using a clustering technique and the ASTRONOMALY package. As proof of concept, we evaluate 85 553 min-cadenced light curves collected over two ~1.5 h periods as part of the Deeper, Wider, Faster program, using two different telescope dithering strategies. By combining the clustering technique HDBSCAN with the isolation forest anomaly detection algorithm via the visual interface of ASTRONOMALY, we are able to rapidly isolate anomalous sources for further analysis. We successfully recover the known variable sources, across a range of catalogues from within the fields, and find a further seven uncatalogued variables and two stellar flare events, including a rarely observed ultrafast flare (~5 min) from a likely M-dwarf.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.498.3077W
Constraining the host galaxy halos of massive black holes from LISA event rates;;The coalescence of massive black hole binaries (with masses 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>) leads to gravitational wave emission that is detectable out to high redshifts (0z ~ 2) with the forthcoming LISA observatory. We combine the theoretically derived merger rates for dark matter haloes at various redshifts, with an empirically motivated prescription that connects the mass of a dark matter halo and that of its central black hole. Using the expected constraints on the (chirp or reduced) masses of binary black holes, their mass ratios and redshift uncertainties, we forecast the measurement precision on the occupation fraction, normalization and slope of the black hole mass-halo mass relation at various redshifts, assuming a five-year LISA survey for three different confidence scenarios. We use the expected sizes of the LISA localization ellipses on the sky to estimate the number of electromagnetic counterparts to the gravitational wave sources which are detectable by future wide-field optical surveys, such as LSST.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020JCAP...11..055P
FLEET: A Redshift-agnostic Machine Learning Pipeline to Rapidly Identify Hydrogen-poor Superluminous Supernovae;;Over the past decade wide-field optical time-domain surveys have increased the discovery rate of transients to the point that ≲10% are being spectroscopically classified. Despite this, these surveys have enabled the discovery of new and rare types of transients, most notably the class of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSN-I), with about 150 events confirmed to date. Here we present a machine-learning classification algorithm targeted at rapid identification of a pure sample of SLSN-I to enable spectroscopic and multiwavelength follow-up. This algorithm is part of the Finding Luminous and Exotic Extragalactic Transients (FLEET) observational strategy. It utilizes both light-curve and contextual information, but without the need for a redshift, to assign each newly discovered transient a probability of being a SLSN-I. This classifier can achieve a maximum purity of about 85% (with 20% completeness) when observing a selection of SLSN-I candidates. Additionally, we present two alternative classifiers that use either redshifts or complete light curves and can achieve an even higher purity and completeness. At the current discovery rate, the FLEET algorithm can provide about 20 SLSN-I candidates per year for spectroscopic follow-up with 85% purity; with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time we anticipate this will rise to more than $\sim {10}^{3}$ events per year.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...904...74G
Stars Stripped in Binaries: The Living Gravitational-wave Sources;;Binary interaction can cause stellar envelopes to be stripped, which significantly reduces the radius of the star. The orbit of a binary composed of a stripped star and a compact object can therefore be so tight that the gravitational radiation the system produces reaches frequencies accessible to the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Two such stripped stars in tight orbits with white dwarfs are known so far (ZTF J2130+4420 and CD-30°11223), but many more are expected to exist. These binaries provide important constraints for binary evolution models and may be used as LISA verification sources. We develop a Monte Carlo code that uses detailed evolutionary models to simulate the Galactic population of stripped stars in tight orbits with either neutron star or white dwarf companions. We predict 0-100 stripped star + white dwarf binaries and 0-4 stripped star + neutron star binaries with a signal-to-noise ratio >5 after 10 yr of observations with LISA. More than 90% of these binaries are expected to show large radial velocity shifts of ≳200 $\,\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ , which are spectroscopically detectable. Photometric variability due to tidal deformation of the stripped star is also expected and has been observed in ZTF J2130+4420 and CD-30°11223. In addition, the stripped star + neutron star binaries are expected to be X-ray bright with L<SUB>X</SUB> ≳ 10<SUP>33</SUP>-10<SUP>36</SUP> $\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ . Our results show that stripped star binaries are promising multimessenger sources for the upcoming electromagnetic and gravitational wave facilities.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...904...56G
The Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey. II. A Public Statistical Sample for Exploring Supernova Demographics;;We present a public catalog of transients from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey, a magnitude-limited (m < 19 mag in either the g or r filter) survey for extragalactic transients in the ZTF public stream. We introduce cuts on survey coverage, sky visibility around peak light, and other properties unconnected to the nature of the transient, and show that the resulting statistical sample is spectroscopically 97% complete at <18 mag, 93% complete at <18.5 mag, and 75% complete at <19 mag. We summarize the fundamental properties of this population, identifying distinct duration-luminosity correlations in a variety of supernova (SN) classes and associating the majority of fast optical transients with well-established spectroscopic SN types (primarily SN Ibn and II/IIb). We measure the Type Ia SN and core-collapse (CC) SN rates and luminosity functions, which show good consistency with recent work. About 7% of CC SNe explode in very low-luminosity galaxies (M<SUB>i</SUB> > -16 mag), 10% in red-sequence galaxies, and 1% in massive ellipticals. We find no significant difference in the luminosity or color distributions between the host galaxies of SNe Type II and SNe Type Ib/c, suggesting that line-driven wind stripping does not play a major role in the loss of the hydrogen envelope from their progenitors. Future large-scale classification efforts with ZTF and other wide-area surveys will provide high-quality measurements of the rates, properties, and environments of all known types of optical transients and limits on the existence of theoretically predicted but as yet unobserved explosions. * An interactive catalog with all data used in this paper is available at https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/ztf/bts and is updated in real time.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...904...35P
High-energy Neutrinos and Gamma Rays from Nonrelativistic Shock-powered Transients;;Shock interaction has been argued to play a role in powering a range of optical transients, including supernovae, classical novae, stellar mergers, tidal disruption events, and fast blue optical transients. These same shocks can accelerate relativistic ions, generating high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray emission via hadronic pion production. The recent discovery of time-correlated optical and gamma-ray emission in classical novae has revealed the important role of radiative shocks in powering these events, enabling an unprecedented view of the properties of ion acceleration, including its efficiency and energy spectrum, under similar physical conditions to shocks in extragalactic transients. Here we introduce a model for connecting the radiated optical fluence of nonrelativistic transients to their maximal neutrino and gamma-ray fluence. We apply this technique to a wide range of extragalactic transient classes in order to place limits on their contributions to the cosmological high-energy gamma-ray and neutrino backgrounds. Based on a simple model for diffusive shock acceleration at radiative shocks, calibrated to novae, we demonstrate that several of the most luminous transients can accelerate protons up to 10<SUP>16</SUP> eV, sufficient to contribute to the IceCube astrophysical background. Furthermore, several of the considered sources—particularly hydrogen-poor supernovae—may serve as "gamma-ray-hidden" neutrino sources owing to the high gamma-ray opacity of their ejecta, evading constraints imposed by the nonblazar Fermi Large Area Telescope background. However, adopting an ion acceleration efficiency of ∼0.3%-1% motivated by nova observations, we find that currently known classes of nonrelativistic, potentially shock-powered transients contribute at most a few percent of the total IceCube background.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...904....4F
Orbital Foregrounds for Ultra-short Duration Transients;;Reflections from objects in Earth orbit can produce subsecond, star-like optical flashes similar to astrophysical transients. Reflections have historically caused false alarms for transient surveys, but the population has not been systematically studied. We report event rates for these orbital flashes using the Evryscope Fast Transient Engine, a low-latency transient detection pipeline for the Evryscopes. We select single-epoch detections likely caused by Earth satellites and model the event rate as a function of both magnitude and sky position. We measure a rate of ${1800}_{-280}^{+600}$ sky<SUP>-1</SUP> hr<SUP>-1</SUP>, peaking at m<SUB>g</SUB> = 13.0, for flashes morphologically degenerate with real astrophysical signals in surveys like the Evryscopes. Of these, ${340}_{-85}^{+150}$ sky<SUP>-1</SUP> hr<SUP>-1</SUP> are bright enough to be visible to the naked eye in typical suburban skies with a visual limiting magnitude of V ≈ 4. These measurements place the event rate of orbital flashes orders of magnitude higher than the combined rate of public alerts from all active all-sky fast-timescale transient searches, including neutrino, gravitational-wave, gamma-ray, and radio observatories. Short-timescale orbital flashes form a dominating foreground for untriggered searches for fast transients in low-resolution, wide-angle surveys. However, events like fast radio bursts with arcminute-scale localization have a low probability (∼10<SUP>-5</SUP>) of coincidence with an orbital flash, allowing optical surveys to place constraints on their potential optical counterparts in single images. Upcoming satellite internet constellations, like SpaceX Starlink, are unlikely to contribute significantly to the population of orbital flashes in normal operations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...903L..27C
A Non-equipartition Shock Wave Traveling in a Dense Circumstellar Environment around SN 2020oi;;We report the discovery and panchromatic follow-up observations of the young Type Ic supernova (SN Ic) SN 2020oi in M100, a grand-design spiral galaxy at a mere distance of 14 Mpc. We followed up with observations at radio, X-ray, and optical wavelengths from only a few days to several months after explosion. The optical behavior of the supernova is similar to those of other normal SNe Ic. The event was not detected in the X-ray band but our radio observations revealed a bright mJy source ( ${L}_{\nu }\approx 1.2\times {10}^{27}\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\,{\mathrm{Hz}}^{-1}$ ). Given the relatively small number of stripped envelope SNe for which radio emission is detectable, we used this opportunity to perform a detailed analysis of the comprehensive radio data set we obtained. The radio-emitting electrons initially experience a phase of inverse Compton cooling, which leads to steepening of the spectral index of the radio emission. Our analysis of the cooling frequency points to a large deviation from equipartition at the level of ɛ<SUB>e</SUB>/ɛ<SUB>B</SUB> ≳ 200, similar to a few other cases of stripped envelope SNe. Our modeling of the radio data suggests that the shock wave driven by the SN ejecta into the circumstellar matter (CSM) is moving at $\sim 3\times {10}^{4}\,\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ . Assuming a constant mass loss from the stellar progenitor, we find that the mass-loss rate is $\dot{M}\approx 1.4\times {10}^{-4}\,{M}_{\odot }\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$ for an assumed wind velocity of $1000\,\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ . The temporal evolution of the radio emission suggests a radial CSM density structure steeper than the standard r<SUP>-2</SUP>.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...903..132H
Caltech-NRAO Stripe 82 Survey (CNSS). III. The First Radio-discovered Tidal Disruption Event, CNSS J0019+00;;We present the discovery of a nuclear transient with the Caltech-NRAO Stripe 82 Survey (CNSS), a dedicated radio transient survey carried out with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). This transient, CNSS J001947.3+003527, exhibited a turn-on over a timescale of ≲1 yr, increasing in flux density at 3 GHz from <0.14 mJy in 2014 February to 4.4 ± 0.1 mJy in 2015 March, reaching a peak luminosity of $5\times {10}^{28}\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\,{\mathrm{Hz}}^{-1}$ around 2015 October. The association of CNSS J0019+00 with the nucleus (Gaia and our very-long baseline interferometry positions are consistent to within 1 pc) of a nearby S0 Seyfert galaxy at 77 Mpc, together with the radio spectral evolution, implies that this transient is most likely a tidal disruption event (TDE). Our equipartition analysis indicates the presence of a ∼15,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> outflow, having energy ∼10<SUP>49</SUP> erg. We derive the radial density profile for the circumnuclear material in the host galaxy to be proportional to R<SUP>-2.5</SUP>. All of these properties suggest resemblance with radio-detected thermal TDEs like ASASSN-14li and XMMSL1 J0740-85. No significant X-ray or optical emission is detected from CNSS J0019+00, although this may simply be due to the thermal emission being weak during our late-time follow-up observations. From the CNSS survey we have obtained the first unbiased measurement of the rate of radio TDEs, R(>500μJy) of about 2 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> deg<SUP>-2</SUP>, or equivalently a volumetric rate of about 10 Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. This rate implies that all-sky radio surveys such as the VLA Sky Survey and those planned with ASKAP, will find many tens of radio TDEs over the next few years.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...903..116A
Deep Modeling of Quasar Variability;;Quasars have long been known as intrinsically variable sources, but the physical mechanism underlying the temporal optical/UV variability is still not well understood. We propose a novel nonparametric method for modeling and forecasting the optical variability of quasars utilizing an AE neural network to gain insight into the underlying processes. The AE is trained with ∼15,000 decade-long quasar light curves obtained by the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey selected with negligible flux contamination from the host galaxy. The AE&'s performance in forecasting the temporal flux variation of quasars is superior to that of the damped random walk process. We find a temporal asymmetry in the optical variability and a novel relation—the amplitude of the variability asymmetry decreases as luminosity and/or black hole mass increases—is suggested with the help of autoencoded features. The characteristics of the variability asymmetry are in agreement with those from the self-organized disk instability model, which predicts that the magnitude of the variability asymmetry decreases as the ratio of the diffusion mass to inflow mass in the accretion disk increases.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...903...54T
Light-time effect detected in fourteen eclipsing binaries;;The available minima timings of 14 selected eclipsing binaries (V1297 Cas, HD 24105, KU Aur, GU CMa, GH Mon, AZ Vel, DI Lyn, DK Her, GQ Dra, V624 Her, V1134 Her, KIC 6187893, V1928 Aql, V2486 Cyg) were collected and analyzed. Using the automatic telescopes, surveys, and satellite data, we derived more than 2500 times of eclipses, accompanied with our own ground-based observations. These data were used to detect the period variations in these multiple systems. The eclipse timing variations were described using the third-body hypothesis and the light-time effect. Their respective periods were derived as 2.5, 16.2, 27, 20, 64, 5.6, 22, 115, 27, 42, 6.9, 11.2, 4.1, and 8.4 years for these systems, respectively. The predicted minimal mass of the third body was calculated for each of the systems, and we discuss here their prospective detectability. The light curves of HD 24105, GH Mon, DK Her, V1134 Her, KIC 6187893, V1928 Aql, and V2486 Cyg were analyzed using the PHOEBE program, resulting in physical parameters of the components. Significant fractions of the third light were detected during the light-curve analysis, supporting our hypothesis of the triple-star nature of all these systems. The majority of these systems (nine out of 14) were already known as visual doubles. Our study shifts them to possible quadruples, what makes them even more interesting.

Observational constraints on the optical and near-infrared emission from the neutron star-black hole binary merger candidate S190814bv;;Context. Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has rapidly reached maturity, becoming a fundamental observing window for modern astrophysics. The coalescences of a few tens of black hole (BH) binaries have been detected, while the number of events possibly including a neutron star (NS) is still limited to a few. On 2019 August 14, the LIGO and Virgo interferometers detected a high-significance event labelled S190814bv. A preliminary analysis of the GW data suggests that the event was likely due to the merger of a compact binary system formed by a BH and a NS. 
 Aims: In this paper, we present our extensive search campaign aimed at uncovering the potential optical and near infrared electromagnetic counterpart of S190814bv. We found no convincing electromagnetic counterpart in our data. We therefore use our non-detection to place limits on the properties of the putative outflows that could have been produced by the binary during and after the merger. 
 Methods: Thanks to the three-detector observation of S190814bv, and given the characteristics of the signal, the LIGO and Virgo Collaborations delivered a relatively narrow localisation in low latency - a 50% (90%) credible area of 5 deg<SUP>2</SUP> (23 deg<SUP>2</SUP>) - despite the relatively large distance of 267 ± 52 Mpc. ElectromagNetic counterparts of GRAvitational wave sources at the VEry Large Telescope collaboration members carried out an intensive multi-epoch, multi-instrument observational campaign to identify the possible optical and near infrared counterpart of the event. In addition, the ATLAS, GOTO, GRAWITA-VST, Pan-STARRS, and VINROUGE projects also carried out a search on this event. In this paper, we describe the combined observational campaign of these groups. 
 Results: Our observations allow us to place limits on the presence of any counterpart and discuss the implications for the kilonova (KN), which was possibly generated by this NS-BH merger, and for the strategy of future searches. The typical depth of our wide-field observations, which cover most of the projected sky localisation probability (up to 99.8%, depending on the night and filter considered), is r ∼ 22 (resp. K ∼ 21) in the optical (resp. near infrared). We reach deeper limits in a subset of our galaxy-targeted observations, which cover a total ∼50% of the galaxy-mass-weighted localisation probability. Altogether, our observations allow us to exclude a KN with large ejecta mass M ≳ 0.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> to a high (> 90%) confidence, and we can exclude much smaller masses in a sub-sample of our observations. This disfavours the tidal disruption of the neutron star during the merger. 
 Conclusions: Despite the sensitive instruments involved in the campaign, given the distance of S190814bv, we could not reach sufficiently deep limits to constrain a KN comparable in luminosity to AT 2017gfo on a large fraction of the localisation probability. This suggests that future (likely common) events at a few hundred megaparsecs will be detected only by large facilities with both a high sensitivity and large field of view. Galaxy-targeted observations can reach the needed depth over a relevant portion of the localisation probability with a smaller investment of resources, but the number of galaxies to be targeted in order to get a fairly complete coverage is large, even in the case of a localisation as good as that of this event.

Investigating the magnetospheric accretion process in the young pre-transitional disk system DoAr 44 (V2062 Oph). A multiwavelength interferometric, spectropolarimetric, and photometric observing campaign;;Context. Young stars interact with their accretion disk through their strong magnetosphere. 
 Aims: We aim to investigate the magnetospheric accretion/ejection process in the young stellar system DoAr 44 (V2062 Oph). 
 Methods: We monitored the system over several rotational cycles, combining high-resolution spectropolarimetry at both optical and near-IR wavelengths with long-baseline near-IR inteferometry and multicolor photometry. 
 Results: We derive a rotational period of 2.96 d from the system's light curve, which is dominated by stellar spots. We fully characterize the central star's properties from the high signal-to-noise, high-resolution optical spectra we obtained during the campaign. DoAr 44 is a young 1.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> star, moderately accreting from its disk (Ṁ<SUB>acc</SUB> = 6.5 10<SUP>-9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>), and seen at a low inclination (i ≃ 30°). Several optical and near-IR line profiles probing the accretion funnel flows (Hα, Hβ, HeI 1083 nm, Paβ) and the accretion shock (HeI 587.6 nm) are modulated at the stellar rotation period. The most variable line profile is HeI 1083 nm, which exhibits modulated redshifted wings that are a signature of accretion funnel flows, as well as deep blueshifted absorptions indicative of transient outflows. The Zeeman-Doppler analysis suggests the star hosts a mainly dipolar magnetic field, inclined by about 20° onto the spin axis, with an intensity reaching about 800 G at the photosphere, and up to 2 ± 0.8 kG close to the accretion shock. The magnetic field appears strong enough to disrupt the inner disk close to the corotation radius, at a distance of about 4.6 R<SUB>⋆</SUB> (0.043 au), which is consistent with the 5 R<SUB>⋆</SUB> (0.047 au) upper limit we derived for the size of the magnetosphere in our Paper I from long baseline interferometry. 
 Conclusions: DoAr 44 is a pre-transitional disk system, exhibiting a 25-30 au gap in its circumstellar disk, with the inner and outer disks being misaligned. On a scale of 0.1 au or less, our results indicate that the system is steadily accreting from its inner disk through its tilted dipolar magnetosphere. We conclude that in spite of a highly structured disk on the large scale, perhaps the signature of ongoing planetary formation, the magnetospheric accretion process proceeds unimpeded at the star-disk interaction level.

Two stripped envelope supernovae with circumstellar interaction. But only one really shows it;;Context. We present observations of SN 2019tsf (ZTF19ackjszs) and SN 2019oys (ZTF19abucwzt). These two stripped envelope (SE) Type Ib supernovae (SNe) suddenly showed a (re-)brightening in their late light curves. We investigate this in the context of circumstellar material (CSM) interaction with previously ejected material, a phenomenon that is unusual among SE SNe. 
 Aims: We use our follow-up photometry and spectroscopy for these supernovae to demonstrate the presence of CSM interaction, estimate the properties of the CSM, and discuss why the signals are so different for the two objects. 
 Methods: We present and analyze observational data, consisting of optical light curves and spectra. For SN 2019oys, we also have detections in radio as well as limits from UV and X-rays. 
 Results: Both light curves show spectacular re-brightening after about 100 days. In the case of SN 2019tsf, the re-brightening is followed by a new period of decline, and the spectra never show signs of narrow emission lines that would indicate CSM interaction. On the contrary, SN 2019oys made a spectral makeover from a Type Ib to a spectrum clearly dominated by CSM interaction at the light curve brightening phase. Deep Keck spectra reveal a plethora of narrow high-ionization lines, including coronal lines, and the radio observations show strong emission. 
 Conclusions: The rather similar light curve behavior - with a late linear re-brightening - of these two Type Ib SE SNe indicate CSM interaction as the powering source. For SN 2019oys the evidence for a phase where the ejecta hit H-rich material, likely ejected from the progenitor star, is conspicuous. We observe strong narrow lines of H and He, but also a plethora of high-ionization lines, including coronal lines, revealing shock interaction. Spectral simulations of SN 2019oys show two distinct density components, one with density ≳10<SUP>9</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, dominated by somewhat broader, low-ionization lines of H I, He I, Na I, and Ca II, and one with narrow, high-ionization lines at a density ∼10<SUP>6</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. The former is strongly affected by electron scattering, while the latter is unaffected. The evidence for CSM interaction in SN 2019oys is corroborated by detections in radio. On the contrary, for SN 2019tsf, we find little evidence in the spectra for any CSM interaction.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A&A...643A..79S
First systematic high-precision survey of bright supernovae. I. Methodology for identifying early bumps;;Rapid variability before and near the maximum brightness of supernovae has the potential to provide a better understanding of nearly every aspect of supernovae, from the physics of the explosion up to their progenitors and the circumstellar environment. Thanks to modern time-domain optical surveys, which are discovering supernovae in the early stage of their evolution, we have the unique opportunity to capture their intraday behavior before maximum. We present high-cadence photometric monitoring (on the order of seconds-minutes) of the optical light curves of three Type Ia and two Type II SNe over several nights before and near maximum light, using the fast imagers available on the 2.3 m Aristarchos telescope at Helmos Observatory and the 1.2 m telescope at Kryoneri Observatory in Greece. We applied differential aperture photometry techniques using optimal apertures and we present reconstructed light curves after implementing a seeing correction and the Trend Filtering Algorithm (TFA, Kovács et al. 2005, MNRAS, 356, 557). TFA yielded the best results, achieving a typical precision between 0.01 and 0.04 mag. We did not detect significant bumps with amplitudes greater than 0.05 mag in any of the SNe targets in the VR-, R-, and I-bands light curves obtained. We measured the intraday slope for each light curve, which ranges between -0.37-0.36 mag day<SUP>-1</SUP> in broadband VR, -0.19-0.31 mag day<SUP>-1</SUP> in R band, and -0.13-0.10 mag day<SUP>-1</SUP> in I band. We used SNe light curve fitting templates for SN 2018gv, SN 2018hgc and SN 2018hhn to photometrically classify the light curves and to calculate the time of maximum. We provide values for the maximum of SN 2018zd after applying a low-order polynomial fit and SN 2018hhn for the first time. We conclude that optimal aperture photometry in combination with TFA provides the highest-precision light curves for SNe that are relatively well separated from the centers of their host galaxies. This work aims to inspire the use of ground-based, high-cadence and high-precision photometry to study SNe with the purpose of revealing clues and properties of the explosion environment of both core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae, the explosion mechanisms, binary star interaction and progenitor channels. We suggest monitoring early supernovae light curves in hotter (bluer) bands with a cadence of hours as a promising way of investigating the post-explosion photometric behavior of the progenitor stars.

Optical-Ultraviolet Tidal Disruption Events;;The existence of optical-ultraviolet Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) could be considered surprising because their electromagnetic output was originally predicted to be dominated by X-ray emission from an accretion disk. Yet over the last decade, the growth of optical transient surveys has led to the identification of a new class of optical transients occurring exclusively in galaxy centers, many of which are considered to be TDEs. Here we review the observed properties of these events, identified based on a shared set of both photometric and spectroscopic properties. We present a homogeneous analysis of 33 sources that we classify as robust TDEs, and which we divide into classes. The criteria used here to classify TDEs will possibly get updated as new samples are collected and potential additional diversity of TDEs is revealed. We also summarize current measurements of the optical-ultraviolet TDE rate, as well as the mass function and luminosity function. Many open questions exist regarding the current sample of events. We anticipate that the search for answers will unlock new insights in a variety of fields, from accretion physics to galaxy evolution.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020SSRv..216..124V
Observational signatures of close binaries of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei;;Inspired by the General Relativity for many decades, experimental physicists and astronomers have a solid dream to detect gravitational waves (GWs) from mergers of black holes, which came true until the excellent performance of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) at hundreds Hz. Nano-Hz GWs are expected to be radiated by close-binaries of supermassive black holes (CB-SMBHs; defined as those with separations less than ∼0.1 pc) formed during galaxy mergers and detected through the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) technique. As of the writing, there remains no nano-Hz GWs detection. Searching for CB-SMBHs is also observationally elusive though there exist a number of possible candidates. In this review, we focus on observational signatures of CB-SMBHs from theoretic expectations, simulations and observations. These signatures appear in energy distributions of multiwavelength continuum, long term variations of continuum, jet morphology, reverberation delay maps and spectroastrometry of broad emission lines, AGN type transitions between type-1 and type-2 (changing-look), and gaseous dynamics of circumbinary disks, etc. Unlike hundred-Hz GWs from stellar mass black hole binaries, the waveform chirping of nano-Hz GWs is too slow to detect in a reasonable human timescale. We have to resort to electromagnetic observations to measure orbital parameters of CB-SMBHs to test nano-Hz GW properties. Reverberation mapping is a powerful tool for probing kinematics and geometry of ionized gas in the gravitational well of SMBHs (single or binary) and therefore provides a potential way to determine orbital parameters of CB-SMBHs. In particular, a combination of reverberation mapping with spectroastrometry (realized at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer) will further reinforce this capability. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are suggested to reveal dynamics of circumbinary disks through molecular emission lines.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020RAA....20..160W
Neutrino emission from an off-axis jet driven by the tidal disruption event AT2019dsg;;Recently, a high-energy muon neutrino event was detected in association with a tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2019dsg at the time about 150 days after the peak of the optical/UV luminosity. We propose that such an association could be interpreted as arising from hadronic interactions between relativistic protons accelerated in the jet launched from the TDE and the intense radiation field of TDE inside the optical/UV photosphere, if we are observing the jet at a moderate angle (i.e., approximately 10 ° -3 0 ° ) with respect to the jet axis. Such an off-axis viewing angle leads to a high gas column density in the line of sight, which provides a high opacity for the photoionization and the Bethe-Heitler process and allows the existence of an intrinsic long-term x-ray radiation of comparatively high emissivity. As a result, the cascade emission accompanying the neutrino production, which would otherwise overshoot the flux limits in the x-ray and/or GeV band, is significantly obscured or absorbed. Since the jets of TDEs are supposed to be randomly oriented in the sky, the source density rate of TDE with an off-axis jet is significantly higher than that of TDE with an on-axis jet. Therefore, an off-axis jet is naturally expected in a nearby TDE being discovered, supporting the proposed scenario.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhRvD.102h3028L
GWOPS: A VO-technology Driven Tool to Search for the Electromagnetic Counterpart of Gravitational Wave Event;;The search and follow-up observation of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of gravitational waves (GW) is a current hot topic of GW cosmology. Due to the limitation of the accuracy of the GW observation facility at this stage, we can only get a rough sky-localization region for the GW event, and the typical area of the region is between 200 and 1500 square degrees. Since GW events occur in or near galaxies, limiting the observation target to galaxies can significantly speedup searching for EM counterparts. Therefore, how to efficiently select host galaxy candidates in such a large GW localization region, how to arrange the observation sequence, and how to efficiently identify the GW source from observational data are the problems that need to be solved. International Virtual Observatory Alliance has developed a series of technical standards for data retrieval, interoperability and visualization. Based on the application of VO technologies, we construct the GW follow-up Observation Planning System (GWOPS). It consists of three parts: a pipeline to select host candidates of GW and sort their priorities for follow-up observation, an identification module to find the transient from follow-up observation data, and a visualization module to display GW-related data. GWOPS can rapidly respond to GW events. With GWOPS, the operations such as follow-up observation planning, data storage, data visualization, and transient identification can be efficiently coordinated, which will promote the success searching rate for GWs EM counterparts.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132j4501X
Exocomets from a Solar System Perspective;;Exocomets are small bodies releasing gas and dust which orbit stars other than the Sun. Their existence was first inferred from the detection of variable absorption features in stellar spectra in the late 1980s using spectroscopy. More recently, they have been detected through photometric transits from space, and through far-IR/mm gas emission within debris disks. As (exo)comets are considered to contain the most pristine material accessible in stellar systems, they hold the potential to give us information about early stage formation and evolution conditions of extra solar systems. In the solar system, comets carry the physical and chemical memory of the protoplanetary disk environment where they formed, providing relevant information on processes in the primordial solar nebula. The aim of this paper is to compare essential compositional properties between solar system comets and exocomets to allow for the development of new observational methods and techniques. The paper aims to highlight commonalities and to discuss differences which may aid the communication between the involved research communities and perhaps also avoid misconceptions. The compositional properties of solar system comets and exocomets are summarized before providing an observational comparison between them. Exocomets likely vary in their composition depending on their formation environment like solar system comets do, and since exocomets are not resolved spatially, they pose a challenge when comparing them to high fidelity observations of solar system comets. Observations of gas around main sequence stars, spectroscopic observations of "polluted" white dwarf atmospheres and spectroscopic observations of transiting exocomets suggest that exocomets may show compositional similarities with solar system comets. The recent interstellar visitor 2I/Borisov showed gas, dust and nuclear properties similar to that of solar system comets. This raises the tantalising prospect that observations of interstellar comets may help bridge the fields of exocomet and solar system comets.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132j1001S
Photometric classification of Hyper Suprime-Cam transients using machine learning;;The advancement of technology has resulted in a rapid increase in supernova (SN) discoveries. The Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) transient survey, conducted from fall 2016 through spring 2017, yielded 1824 SN candidates. This gave rise to the need for fast type classification for spectroscopic follow-up and prompted us to develop a machine learning algorithm using a deep neural network with highway layers. This algorithm is trained by actual observed cadence and filter combinations such that we can directly input the observed data array without any interpretation. We tested our model with a dataset from the LSST classification challenge (Deep Drilling Field). Our classifier scores an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.996 for binary classification (SN Ia or non-SN Ia) and 95.3% accuracy for three-class classification (SN Ia, SN Ibc, or SN II). Application of our binary classification to HSC transient data yields an AUC score of 0.925. With two weeks of HSC data since the first detection, this classifier achieves 78.1% accuracy for binary classification, and the accuracy increases to 84.2% with the full dataset. This paper discusses the potential use of machine learning for SN type classification purposes.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASJ...72...89T
The host galaxies of 106 rapidly evolving transients discovered by the Dark Energy Survey;;Rapidly evolving transients (RETs), also termed fast blue optical transients, are a recently discovered group of astrophysical events that display rapid luminosity evolution. RETs typically rise to peak in less than 10 d and fade within 30, a time-scale unlikely to be compatible with the decay of Nickel-56 that drives conventional supernovae (SNe). Their peak luminosity spans a range of -15 < M<SUB>g</SUB> < -22.5, with some events observed at redshifts greater than 1. Their evolution on fast time-scales has hindered high-quality follow-up observations, and thus their origin and explosion/emission mechanism remains unexplained. In this paper, we present the largest sample of RETs to date, comprising 106 objects discovered by the Dark Energy Survey, and perform the most comprehensive analysis of RET host galaxies. Using deep-stacked photometry and emission lines from OzDES spectroscopy, we derive stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) for 49 host galaxies, and metallicities ([O/H]) for 37. We find that RETs explode exclusively in star-forming galaxies and are thus likely associated with massive stars. Comparing RET hosts to samples of host galaxies of other explosive transients as well as field galaxies, we find that RETs prefer galaxies with high specific SFRs (⟨log (sSFR)⟩ ~ -9.6), indicating a link to young stellar populations, similar to stripped-envelope SNe. RET hosts appear to show a lack of chemical enrichment, their metallicities akin to long-duration gamma-ray bursts and superluminous SN host galaxies (⟨12 + log (O/H)⟩ ~ 9.4). There are no clear relationships between mass or SFR of the host galaxies and the peak magnitudes or decline rates of the transients themselves.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.498.2575W
The first high-redshift changing-look quasars;;We report on three redshift z > 2 quasars with dramatic changes in their C IV emission lines, the first sample of changing-look quasars (CLQs) at high redshift. This is also the first time the changing-look behaviour has been seen in a high-ionization emission line. SDSS J1205+3422, J1638+2827, and J2228 + 2201 show interesting behaviour in their observed optical light curves, and subsequent spectroscopy shows significant changes in the C IV broad emission line, with both line collapse and emergence being displayed on rest-frame time-scales of ~240-1640 d. These are rapid changes, especially when considering virial black hole mass estimates of M<SUB>BH</SUB> > 10<SUP>9</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB> for all three quasars. Continuum and emission line measurements from the three quasars show changes in the continuum-equivalent width plane with the CLQs seen to be on the edge of the full population distribution, and showing indications of an intrinsic Baldwin effect. We put these observations in context with recent state-change models, and note that even in their observed low-state, the C IV CLQs are generally above ~5 per cent in Eddington luminosity.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.498.2339R
K2: Background Survey - the search for undiscovered transients in Kepler/K2 data;;The K2 mission of the Kepler Space Telescope offers a unique possibility to examine sources of both Galactic and extragalactic origin with high-cadence photometry. Alongside the multitude of supernovae and quasars detected within targeted galaxies, it is likely that Kepler has serendipitously observed many transients throughout K2. Such events will likely have occurred in background pixels, coincidentally surrounding science targets. Analysing the background pixels presents the possibility to conduct a high-cadence survey with areas of a few square degrees per campaign. We demonstrate the capacity to independently recover key K2 transients such as KSN 2015K and SN 2018oh. With this survey, we expect to detect numerous transients and determine the first comprehensive rates for transients with lifetimes of ≤1 d.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.498...33R
GRANDMA observations of advanced LIGO's and advanced Virgo's third observational campaign;;GRANDMA (Global Rapid Advanced Network Devoted to the Multi-messenger Addicts) is a network of 25 telescopes of different sizes, including both photometric and spectroscopic facilities. The network aims to coordinate follow-up observations of gravitational-wave (GW) candidate alerts, especially those with large localization uncertainties, to reduce the delay between the initial detection and the optical confirmation. In this paper, we detail GRANDMA's observational performance during Advanced LIGO/Advanced Virgo Observing Run 3 (O3), focusing on the second part of O3; this includes summary statistics pertaining to coverage and possible astrophysical origin of the candidates. To do so, we quantify our observation efficiency in terms of delay between GW candidate trigger time, observations, and the total coverage. Using an optimized and robust coordination system, GRANDMA followed-up about 90 per cent of the GW candidate alerts, that is 49 out of 56 candidates. This led to coverage of over 9000 deg<SUP>2</SUP> during O3. The delay between the GW candidate trigger and the first observation was below 1.5 h for 50 per cent of the alerts. We did not detect any electromagnetic counterparts to the GW candidates during O3, likely due to the very large localization areas (on average thousands of degrees squares) and relatively large distance of the candidates (above 200 Mpc for 60 per cent of binary neutron star, BNS candidates). We derive constraints on potential kilonova properties for two potential BNS coalescences (GW190425 and S200213t), assuming that the events' locations were imaged.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.5518A
A multiwavelength search for black widow and redback counterparts of candidate γ-ray millisecond pulsars;;The wealth of detections of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in γ-rays by Fermi has spurred searches for these objects among the several unidentified γ-ray sources. Interesting targets are a sub-class of binary MSPs, dubbed 'black widows' (BWs) and 'redbacks' (RBs), which are in orbit with low-mass non-degenerate companions fully or partially ablated by irradiation from the MSP wind. These systems can be easily missed in radio pulsar surveys owing to the eclipse of the radio signal by the intra-binary plasma from the ablated companion star photosphere, making them better targets for multiwavelength observations. We used optical and X-ray data from public data bases to carry out a systematic investigation of all the unidentified γ-ray sources from the Fermi Large Area Telescope Third Source Catalog, which have been pre-selected as likely MSP candidates according to a machine-learning technique analysis. We tested our procedure by recovering known binary BW/RB identifications and searched for new ones, finding two possible candidates. At the same time, we investigated previously proposed BW/RB identifications and we ruled out one of them based upon the updated γ-ray source coordinates.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.5364B
A survey for variable young stars with small telescopes - III. Warm spots on the active star V1598 Cyg;;Magnetic spots on low-mass stars can be traced and characterized using multiband photometric light curves. Here, we analyse an extensive data set for one active star, V1598 Cyg, a known variable K dwarf which is either pre-main sequence and/or in a close binary system. Our light curve contains 2854 photometric data points, mostly in V, R<SUB>c</SUB>, I<SUB>c</SUB>, but also in U, B, and Hα, with a total baseline of about 4 yr, obtained with small telescopes as part of the HOYS project. We find that V1598 Cyg is a very fast rotator with a period of 0.8246 d and varying amplitudes in all filters, best explained as a signature of strong magnetic activity and spots. We fit the photometric amplitudes in V, R<SUB>c</SUB>, I<SUB>c</SUB> and use them to estimate spot properties, using a grid-based method that is also propagating uncertainties. We verify the method on a partial data set with high cadence and all five broad-band filters. The method yields spot temperatures and fractional spot coverage with typical uncertainties of 100 K and 3-4 per cent, respectively. V1598 Cyg consistently exhibits spots that are a few hundred degrees warmer than the photosphere, most likely indicating that the light curve is dominated by chromospheric plage. The spot activity varies over our observing baseline, with a typical time-scale of 0.5-1 yr, which we interpret as the typical spot lifetime. Combining our light curve with archival data, we find a six year cycle in the average brightness, that is probably a sign of a magnetic activity cycle.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.4602F
Dynamical evolution of two-planet systems and its connection with white dwarf atmospheric pollution;;Asteroid material is detected in white dwarfs (WDs) as atmospheric pollution by metals, in the form of gas/dust discs, or in photometric transits. Within the current paradigm, minor bodies need to be scattered, most likely by planets, into highly eccentric orbits where the material gets disrupted by tidal forces and then accreted on to the star. This can occur through a planet-planet scattering process triggered by the stellar mass-loss during the post main-sequence (MS) evolution of planetary systems. So far, studies of the N-body dynamics of this process have used artificial planetary system architectures built ad hoc. In this work, we attempt to go a step further and study the dynamical instability provided by more restrictive systems that, at the same time, allow us an exploration of a wider parameter space: the hundreds of multiple planetary systems found around MS stars. We find that most of our simulated systems remain stable during the MS, Red, and Asymptotic Giant Branch and for several Gyr into the WD phases of the host star. Overall, only ≈2.3 ${{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the simulated systems lose a planet on the WD as a result of dynamical instability. If the instabilities take place during the WD phase most of them result in planet ejections with just five planetary configurations ending as a collision of a planet with the WD. Finally 3.2 ${{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the simulated systems experience some form of orbital scattering or orbit crossing that could contribute to the pollution at a sustained rate if planetesimals are present in the same system.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.4091M
Gravitational-wave Merger Forecasting: Scenarios for the Early Detection and Localization of Compact-binary Mergers with Ground-based Observatories;;We present the prospects for the early (pre-merger) detection and localization of compact-binary coalescences using gravitational waves over the next 10 yr. Early warning can enable the direct observation of the prompt and early electromagnetic emission of a neutron star merger. We examine the capabilities of the ground-based detectors at their "Design" sensitivity (2021-2022), the planned "A+" upgrade (2024-2026), and the envisioned "Voyager" concept (late 2020s). We find that for a fiducial rate of binary neutron star mergers of 1000 Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, the Design, A+, and Voyager era networks can provide 18, 54, and 195 s of warning for one source per year of observing, respectively, with a sky localization area <100 deg<SUP>2</SUP> at a 90% credible level. At the same rate, the A+ and Voyager era networks will be able to provide 9 and 43 s of warning, respectively, for a source with <10 deg<SUP>2</SUP> localization area. We compare the idealized search sensitivity to that achieved by the PyCBC Live search tuned for pre-merger detection. The gravitational-wave community will be prepared to produce pre-merger alerts. Our results motivate the operation of observatories with wide fields of view, automation, and the capability for fast slewing to observe simultaneously with the gravitational-wave network.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902L..29N
Helium-rich Superluminous Supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility;;Helium is expected to be present in the massive ejecta of some hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSN-I). However, until now only one event has been identified with He features in its photospheric spectra (PTF10hgi). We present the discovery of a new He-rich SLSN-I, ZTF19aawfbtg (SN2019hge), at z = 0.0866. This event has more than 10 optical spectra at phases from -41 to +103 days relative to the peak, most of which match well with that of PTF10hgi. Confirmation comes from a near-IR spectrum taken at +34 days, revealing He I features with P-Cygni profiles at 1.083 and 2.058 μm. Using the optical spectra of PTF10hgi and SN2019hge as templates, we examined 70 other SLSNe-I discovered by Zwicky Transient Facility in the first two years of operation and found five additional SLSNe-I with distinct He-features. The excitation of He I atoms in normal core-collapse supernovae requires nonthermal radiation, as proposed by previous studies. These He-rich events cannot be explained by the traditional <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mixing model because of their blue spectra, high peak luminosities, and long rise timescales. Magnetar models offer a possible solution since pulsar winds naturally generate high-energy particles, potential sources of nonthermal excitation. An alternative model is the interaction between the ejecta and dense H-poor circumstellar material, which may be supported by observed undulations in the light curves. These six SLSNe-Ib have relatively low-peak luminosities (rest frame M<SUB>g</SUB> = -20.06 ± 0.16).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902L...8Y
High-energy Neutrino and Gamma-Ray Emission from Tidal Disruption Events;;Tidal disruption events (TDE) have been considered as cosmic-ray and neutrino sources for a decade. We suggest two classes of new scenarios for high-energy multi-messenger emission from TDEs that do not have to harbor powerful jets. First, we investigate high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray production in the core region of a supermassive black hole. In particular, we show that ∼1-100 TeV neutrinos and MeV gamma rays can efficiently be produced in hot coronae around an accretion disk. We also study the consequences of particle acceleration in radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). Second, we consider possible cosmic-ray acceleration by sub-relativistic disk-driven winds or interactions between tidal streams, and show that subsequent hadronuclear and photohadronic interactions inside the TDE debris lead to GeV-PeV neutrinos and sub-GeV cascade gamma rays. We demonstrate that these models should be accompanied by soft gamma rays or hard X-rays as well as optical/UV emission, which can be used for future observational tests. Although this work aims to present models of non-jetted high-energy emission, we discuss the implications of the TDE AT2019dsg that might coincide with the high-energy neutrino IceCube-191001A, by considering the corona, RIAF, hidden sub-relativistic wind, and hidden jet models. It is not yet possible to be conclusive about their physical association and the expected number of neutrinos is typically much less than unity. We find that the most optimistic cases of the corona and hidden wind models could be consistent with the observation of IceCube-191001A, whereas jet models are unlikely to explain the multi-messenger observations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902..108M
EVR-CB-004: An Inflated Hot Subdwarf O Star + Unseen WD Companion in a Compact Binary Discovered with the Evryscope;;We present the discovery of EVR-CB-004, a close binary with a remnant stellar core and an unseen white dwarf (WD) companion. The analysis in this work reveals that the primary is potentially an inflated hot subdwarf (sdO) and more likely is a rarer post-blue horizontal branch (post-BHB) star. Post-BHBs are the short-lived shell-burning final stage of a blue horizontal star or hot subdwarf before transitioning to a WD. This object was discovered using Evryscope photometric data in a southern all-sky hot subdwarf variability survey. The photometric light curve for EVR-CB-004 shows multicomponent variability from ellipsoidal deformation of the primary and Doppler boosting, as well as gravitational limb darkening. The binary EVR-CB-004 is one of just a handful of known systems and has a long period (6.08426 hr) and large-amplitude ellipsoidal modulation (16.0% change in brightness from maximum to minimum) for these extremely close binary systems, while the properties of the primary make it a truly unique system. It also shows a peculiar low-amplitude (less than 1%) sinusoidal light-curve variation with a period that is a 1/3 resonance of the binary period. We tentatively identify this additional variation source as a tidally induced resonant pulsation, and we suggest follow-up observations that could verify this interpretation. From the evolutionary state of the system, its components, and its mass fraction, EVR-CB-004 is a strong merger candidate to form a single high-mass (≈1.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) WD. It offers a glimpse into a brief phase of remnant core evolution and secondary variation not seen before in a compact binary.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902...92R
SN 2020bvc: A Broad-line Type Ic Supernova with a Double-peaked Optical Light Curve and a Luminous X-Ray and Radio Counterpart;;We present optical, radio, and X-ray observations of SN 2020bvc (=ASASSN-20bs, ZTF 20aalxlis), a nearby ( $z=0.0252;$ d = 114 Mpc) broad-line (BL) Type Ic supernova (SN) and the first double-peaked Ic-BL discovered without a gamma-ray burst (GRB) trigger. Our observations show that SN 2020bvc shares several properties in common with the Ic-BL SN 2006aj, which was associated with the low-luminosity gamma-ray burst (LLGRB) 060218. First, the 10 GHz radio luminosity ( ${L}_{\mathrm{radio}}\approx {10}^{37}\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ ) is brighter than ordinary core-collapse SNe but fainter than LLGRB SNe such as SN 1998bw (associated with LLGRB 980425). We model our VLA observations (spanning 13-43 days) as synchrotron emission from a mildly relativistic (v ≳ 0.3c) forward shock. Second, with Swift and Chandra, we detect X-ray emission (L<SUB>X</SUB> ≈ 10<SUP>41</SUP> erg ${{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ ) that is not naturally explained as inverse Compton emission or part of the same synchrotron spectrum as the radio emission. Third, high-cadence (6× night<SUP>-1</SUP>) data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) show a double-peaked optical light curve, the first peak from shock cooling of extended low-mass material (mass ${M}_{e} {10}^{-2}\,{M}_{\odot }$ at radius R<SUB>e</SUB> > 10<SUP>12</SUP> cm) and the second peak from the radioactive decay of ${}^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ . SN 2020bvc is the first double-peaked Ic-BL SN discovered without a GRB trigger, so it is noteworthy that it shows X-ray and radio emission similar to LLGRB SNe. For four of the five other nearby (z ≲ 0.05) Ic-BL SNe with ZTF high-cadence data, we rule out a first peak like that seen in SN 2006aj and SN 2020bvc, i.e., that lasts ≈1 day and reaches a peak luminosity M ≈ -18. Follow-up X-ray and radio observations of Ic-BL SNe with well-sampled early optical light curves will establish whether double-peaked optical light curves are indeed predictive of LLGRB-like X-ray and radio emission.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902...86H
Localization of Compact Binary Sources with Second-generation Gravitational-wave Interferometer Networks;;GW170817 began gravitational-wave multimessenger astronomy. However, GW170817 will not be representative of detections in the coming years because typical gravitational-wave sources will be closer the detection horizon, have larger localization regions, and (when present) will have correspondingly weaker electromagnetic emission. In its design state, the gravitational-wave detector network in the mid-2020s will consist of up to five similar-sensitivity second-generation interferometers. The instantaneous sky-coverage by the full network is nearly isotropic, in contrast to the configuration during the first three observing runs. Along with the coverage of the sky, there are also commensurate increases in the average horizon for a given binary mass. We present a realistic set of localizations for binary neutron stars and neutron star-black hole binaries, incorporating intra-network duty cycles and selection effects on the astrophysical distributions. Based on the assumption of an 80% duty cycle, and that two instruments observe a signal above the detection threshold, we anticipate a median of 28 sq. deg. for binary neutron stars, and 50-120 sq. deg. for neutron star-black hole (depending on the population assumed). These distributions have a wide spread, and the best localizations, even for networks with fewer instruments, will have localizations of 1-10 sq. deg. range. The full five instrument network reduces localization regions to a few tens of degrees at worst.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902...71P
Star Formation and Morphological Properties of Galaxies in the Pan-STARRS 3π Survey. I. A Machine-learning Approach to Galaxy and Supernova Classification;;We present a classification of galaxies in the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) 3π survey based on their recent star formation history and morphology. Specifically, we train and test two Random Forest (RF) classifiers using photometric features (colors and moments) from the PS1 data release 2. The labels for the morphological classification are taken from Huertas-Company et al., while labels for the star formation fraction (SFF) are from the Blanton et al. catalog. We find that colors provide more predictive accuracy than photometric moments. We morphologically classify galaxies as either early- or late-type, and our RF model achieves a 78% classification accuracy. Our second model classifies galaxies as having either a low-to-moderate or high SFF. This model achieves an 89% classification accuracy. We apply both RF classifiers to the entire PS1 3π dataset, which allows us to assign two scores to each PS1 source: P<SUB>HSFF</SUB>, which quantifies the probability of having a high SFF; and P<SUB>spiral</SUB>, which quantifies the probability of having a late-type morphology. Finally, as a proof of concept, we apply our classification framework to supernova (SN) host galaxies from the Zwicky Transient Factory and the Lick Observatory Supernova Search samples. We show that by selecting P<SUB>HSFF</SUB> or P<SUB>spiral</SUB>, it is possible to significantly enhance or suppress the fraction of core-collapse SNe (or thermonuclear SNe) in the sample with respect to random guessing. This result demonstrates how contextual information can aid transient classifications at the time of first detection. In the current era of spectroscopically starved time-domain astronomy, prompt automated classification is paramount.

ZTF Early Observations of Type Ia Supernovae. III. Early-time Colors As a Test for Explosion Models and Multiple Populations;;Colors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the first few days after explosion provide a potential discriminant between different models. In this paper, we present g - r colors of 65 SNe Ia discovered within 5 days from first light by the Zwicky Transient Facility in 2018, a sample that is about three times larger than that in the literature. We find that g - r colors are intrinsically rather homogeneous at early phases, with about half of the dispersion attributable to photometric uncertainties ( ${\sigma }_{\mathrm{noise}}\sim {\sigma }_{\mathrm{int}}\,\sim $ 0.18 mag). Colors are nearly constant starting from 6 days after first light (g - r ∼ -0.15 mag), while the time evolution at earlier epochs is characterized by a continuous range of slopes, from events rapidly transitioning from redder to bluer colors (slope of ∼-0.25 mag day<SUP>-1</SUP>) to events with a flatter evolution. The continuum in the slope distribution is in good agreement both with models requiring some amount of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mixed in the outermost regions of the ejecta and with "double-detonation" models having thin helium layers ( ${M}_{\mathrm{He}}=0.01\,{M}_{\odot }$ ) and varying carbon-oxygen core masses. At the same time, six events show evidence for a distinctive "red bump" signature predicted by double-detonation models with larger helium masses. We finally identify a significant correlation between the early-time g - r slopes and supernova brightness, with brighter events associated to flatter color evolution (p-value = 0.006). The distribution of slopes, however, is consistent with being drawn from a single population, with no evidence for two components as claimed in the literature based on B - V colors.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902...48B
ZTF Early Observations of Type Ia Supernovae. II. First Light, the Initial Rise, and Time to Reach Maximum Brightness;;While it is clear that Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are the result of thermonuclear explosions in C/O white dwarfs (WDs), a great deal remains uncertain about the binary companion that facilitates the explosive disruption of the WD. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of a large, unique data set of 127 SNe Ia with exquisite coverage by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). High-cadence (six observations per night) ZTF observations allow us to measure the SN rise time and examine its initial evolution. We develop a Bayesian framework to model the early rise as a power law in time, which enables the inclusion of priors in our model. For a volume-limited subset of normal SNe Ia, we find that the mean power-law index is consistent with 2 in the r<SUB>ZTF</SUB>-band ( ${\alpha }_{r}=2.01\pm 0.02$ ), as expected in the expanding fireball model. There are, however, individual SNe that are clearly inconsistent with ${\alpha }_{r}=2$ . We estimate a mean rise time of 18.9 days (with a range extending from ∼15 to 22 days), though this is subject to the adopted prior. We identify an important, previously unknown, bias whereby the rise times for higher-redshift SNe within a flux-limited survey are systematically underestimated. This effect can be partially alleviated if the power-law index is fixed to α = 2, in which case we estimate a mean rise time of 21.7 days (with a range from ∼18 to 23 days). The sample includes a handful of rare and peculiar SNe Ia. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of lessons learned from the ZTF sample that can eventually be applied to observations from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902...47M
The Young and Nearby Normal Type Ia Supernova 2018gv: UV-optical Observations and the Earliest Spectropolarimetry;;The nondetection of companion stars in SN Ia progenitor systems lends support to the notion of double-degenerate systems and explosions triggered by the merging of two white dwarfs. This very asymmetric process should lead to a conspicuous polarimetric signature. By contrast, observations consistently find very low continuum polarization as the signatures from the explosion process largely dominate over the pre-explosion configuration within several days. Critical information about the interaction of the ejecta with a companion and any circumstellar matter is encoded in the early polarization spectra. In this study, we obtain spectropolarimetry of SN 2018gv with the ESO Very Large Telescope at -13.6 days relative to the B-band maximum light, or ∼5 days after the estimated explosion—the earliest spectropolarimetric observations to date of any SN Ia. These early observations still show a low continuum polarization (≲0.2%) and moderate line polarization (0.30% ± 0.04% for the prominent Si II λ6355 feature and 0.85% ± 0.04% for the high-velocity Ca component). The high degree of spherical symmetry implied by the low-line and continuum polarization at this early epoch is consistent with explosion models of delayed detonations and is inconsistent with the merger-induced explosion scenario. The dense UV and optical photometry and optical spectroscopy within the first ∼100 days after the maximum light indicate that SN 2018gv is a normal SN Ia with similar spectrophotometric behavior to SN 2011fe.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902...46Y
SN 2018fif: The Explosion of a Large Red Supergiant Discovered in Its Infancy by the Zwicky Transient Facility;;High-cadence transient surveys are able to capture supernovae closer to their first light than ever before. Applying analytical models to such early emission, we can constrain the progenitor stars' properties. In this paper, we present observations of SN 2018fif (ZTF 18abokyfk). The supernova was discovered close to first light and monitored by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Early spectroscopic observations suggest that the progenitor of SN 2018fif was surrounded by relatively small amounts of circumstellar material compared to all previous cases. This particularity, coupled with the high-cadence multiple-band coverage, makes it a good candidate to investigate using shock-cooling models. We employ the SOPRANOS code, an implementation of the model by Sapir & Waxman and its extension to early times by Morag et al. Compared with previous implementations, SOPRANOS has the advantage of including a careful account of the limited temporal validity domain of the shock-cooling model as well as allowing usage of the entirety of the early UV data. We find that the progenitor of SN 2018fif was a large red supergiant with a radius of $R={744.0}_{-128.0}^{+183.0}\,{R}_{\odot }$ and an ejected mass of ${M}_{\mathrm{ej}}={9.3}_{-5.8}^{+0.4}\,{M}_{\odot }$ . Our model also gives information on the explosion epoch, the progenitor's inner structure, the shock velocity, and the extinction. The distribution of radii is double-peaked, with smaller radii corresponding to lower values of the extinction, earlier recombination times, and a better match to the early UV data. If these correlations persist in future objects, denser spectroscopic monitoring constraining the time of recombination, as well as accurate UV observations (e.g., with ULTRASAT), will help break the extinction/radius degeneracy and independently determine both.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902....6S
The Outburst of the Young Star Gaia19bey;;We report photometry and spectroscopy of the outburst of the young stellar object Gaia19bey. We have established the outburst light curve with archival Gaia "G," ATLAS "Orange," Zwicky Transient Facility r-band, and Pan-STARRS "rizy"-filter photometry, showing an outburst of ~4 yr duration, longer than typical EX Lupi objects but shorter than FU Orionis objects. Its pre-outburst spectral energy distribution shows a flat far-infrared spectrum, confirming the early evolutionary state of Gaia19bey and its similarity to other deeply embedded young stars experiencing outbursts. A lower limit to the peak outburst luminosity is ~182 ${L}_{\odot }$ at an assumed distance of 1.4 kpc, the minimum plausible distance. Infrared and optical spectroscopy near maximum light show an emission line spectrum, including H I lines, strong red Ca II emission, other metal emission lines, infrared CO bandhead emission, and a strong infrared continuum. Toward the end of the outburst, the emission lines have all but disappeared and the spectrum has changed into an almost pure continuum spectrum. This indicates a cessation of magnetospheric accretion activity. The near-infrared colors have become redder as Gaia19bey has faded, indicating a cooling of the continuum component. Near the end of the outburst, the only remaining strong emission lines are forbidden shock-excited emission lines. Adaptive optics integral-field spectroscopy shows the H<SUB>2</SUB> 1-0 S(1) emission with the morphology of an outflow cavity and the extended emission in the [Fe II] line at 1644 nm with the morphology of an edge-on disk. However, we do not detect any large-scale jet from Gaia19bey.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160..164H
Data Lab-A community science platform;;Data Lab is an open-access science platform developed and operated by the Community and Science Data Center (CSDC) at NSF's National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (NOIRLab). It serves public photometric survey datasets, provides interactive and programmatic data access, and SQL/ADQL query capabilities via TAP. Users also receive generous storage allocations with VOSpace and MyDB, co-located with our data holdings. A host of services such as cross-matching, image cutouts via SIA, file services for survey data, and a Jupyter notebook interface for analysis close to the data complement the mission statement. Launched in 2017 at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, Data Lab supports a base of over 1,300 registered users, processes on average 15,000 queries daily, serves over 50 TB of photometric catalogs, and provides access to over 2 PB of survey image products at NOIRLab's Science Data Archive. Future development will include support for massive spectroscopic datasets and for processing of alert streams generated by e.g. ZTF and LSST. Users will also be able to create and administrate ad hoc user groups for shared data access and scientific analysis, and will enjoy containerized services and notebook spaces.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A&C....3300411N
Constraining the transient high-energy activity of <ASTROBJ>FRB 180916.J0158+65</ASTROBJ> with Insight-HXMT follow-up observations;;Context. A link has finally been established between magnetars and fast radio burst (FRB) sources. Within this context, a major issue that remains unresolved pertains to whether sources of extragalactic FRBs exhibit X/γ-ray outbursts and whether this is correlated with radio activity. If so, the subsequent goal is to identify these sources. 
 Aims: We aim to constrain possible X/γ-ray burst activity from one of the nearest extragalactic FRB sources currently known. This is to be done over a broad energy range by looking for bursts over a range of timescales and energies that are compatible with those of powerful flares from extragalactic magnetars. 
 Methods: We followed up on the observation of the as-yet nearest extragalactic FRB source, located at a mere 149 Mpc distance, namely, the periodic repeater <ASTROBJ>FRB 180916.J0158+65</ASTROBJ>. This took place during the active phase between 4 and 7 February 2020, using the Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT). By taking advantage of the combination of broad-band wavelengths, a large effective area, and several independent detectors at our disposal, we searched for bursts over a set of timescales from 1 ms to 1.024 s with a sensitive algorithm that had been previously characterised and optimised. Moreover, through simulations, we studied the sensitivity of our technique in the released energy-duration phase space for a set of synthetic flares and assuming a range of different energy spectra. 
 Results: We constrain the possible occurrence of flares in the 1-100 keV energy band to E < 10<SUP>46</SUP> erg for durations Δ t < 0.1 s over several tens of ks exposure. 
 Conclusions: We can rule out the occurrence of giant flares similar to the ones that were observed in the few cases of Galactic magnetars. The absence of reported radio activity during our observations prevents us from making any determinations regarding the possibility of simultaneous high-energy emission.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A&A...642A.160G
The formation of neutron star systems through accretion-induced collapse in white-dwarf binaries;;The accretion-induced collapse (AIC) scenario was proposed 40 years ago as an evolutionary end state of oxygen-neon white dwarfs (ONe WDs), linking them to the formation of neutron star (NS) systems. However, there has been no direct detection of any AIC event so far, even though there exists a lot of indirect observational evidence. Meanwhile, the evolutionary pathways resulting in NS formation through AIC are still not thoroughly investigated. In this article, we review recent studies on the two classic progenitor models of AIC events, i.e., the single-degenerate model (including the ONe WD+MS/RG/He star channels and the CO WD+He star channel) and the double-degenerate model (including the double CO WD channel, the double ONe WD channel and the ONe WD+CO WD channel). Recent progress on these progenitor models is reviewed, including the evolutionary scenarios leading to AIC events, the initial parameter space for producing AIC events and the related objects (e.g., the pre-AIC systems and the post-AIC systems). For the single-degenerate model, the pre-AIC systems (i.e., the progenitor systems of AIC events) could potentially be identified as supersoft X-ray sources, symbiotics and cataclysmic variables (such as classical novae, recurrent novae, Ne novae and He novae) in the observations, whereas the post-AIC systems (i.e., NS systems) could potentially be identified as low-/intermediate-mass X-ray binaries, and the resulting low-/intermediate-mass binary pulsars, most notably millisecond pulsars. For the double-degenerate model, the pre-AIC systems are close double WDs with short orbital periods, whereas the post-AIC systems are single isolated NSs that may correspond to a specific kind of NS with peculiar properties. We also review the predicted rates of AIC events, the mass distribution of NSs produced via AIC and the gravitational wave (GW) signals from double WDs that are potential GW sources in the Galaxy in the context of future space-based GW detectors, such as LISA, TianQin, Taiji, etc. Recent theoretical and observational constraints on the detection of AIC events are summarized. In order to confirm the existence of the AIC process, and resolve this long-term issue presented by current stellar evolution theories, more numerical simulations and observational identifications are required.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020RAA....20..135W

Science with the TianQin Observatory: Preliminary results on Galactic double white dwarf binaries;;We explore the prospects of detecting Galactic double white dwarf (DWD) binaries with the space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory TianQin. In this work, we analyze both a sample of currently known DWDs and a realistic synthetic population of DWDs to assess the number of guaranteed detections and the full capacity of the mission. We find that TianQin can detect 12 out of ∼100 known DWDs; GW signals of these binaries can be modeled in detail ahead of the mission launch, and therefore they can be used as verification sources. Besides, we estimate that TianQin has a potential to detect as many as 10<SUP>4</SUP> DWDs in the Milky Way. TianQin is expected to measure their orbital periods and amplitudes with accuracies of ∼10<SUP>-7</SUP> and ∼0.2 , respectively, and to localize on the sky a large fraction (39%) of the detected population to better than 1 deg<SUP>2</SUP> . We conclude that TianQin has the potential to significantly advance our knowledge on Galactic DWDs by increasing the sample up to 2 orders of magnitude, and will allow their multimessenger studies in combination with electromagnetic telescopes. We also test the possibilities of different configurations of TianQin: (1) the same mission with a different orientation, (2) two perpendicular constellations combined into a network, and (3) the combination of the network with the ESA-led Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. We find that the network of detectors boosts the accuracy on the measurement of source parameters by 1-2 orders of magnitude, with the improvement on sky localization being the most significant.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhRvD.102f3021H
A Deep Search for Stable Venus Co-orbital Asteroids: Limits on the Population;;A stable population of objects co-orbiting with Venus was recently hypothesized in order to explain the existence of Venus's co-orbital dust ring. We conducted a five days twilight survey for these objects with the Cerro-Tololo Inter-American Observatory 4 m telescope covering about 35 unique square degrees to 21 mag in the r band. Our survey provides the most stringent limit so far on the number of Venus co-orbital asteroids; it was capable of detecting 5% of the entire population of those asteroids brighter than 21 mag. We estimate an upper limit on the number of co-orbital asteroids brighter than 21 mag (approximately 400-900 m in diameter depending on the asteroid albedo) to be $N={18}_{-14}^{+30}$ . Previous studies estimated the mass of the observed dust ring co-orbiting with Venus to be equivalent to an asteroid with a 2 km diameter ground to dust. Our survey estimates <6 asteroids larger than 2 km. This implies the following possibilities: that Venus co-orbitals are nonreflective at the observed phase angles, have a very low albedo (<1%), or that the Venus co-orbital dust ring has a source other than asteroids co-orbiting Venus. We discuss this result, and as an aid to future searches, we provide predictions for the spatial, visual magnitude, and number density distributions of stable Venus co-orbitals based on the dynamics of the region and magnitude estimates for various asteroid types.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PSJ.....1...47P
On the amount of peculiar velocity field information in supernovae from LSST and beyond;;Peculiar velocities introduce correlations between supernova magnitudes, which implies that the supernova Hubble diagram residual carries information on both the matter power spectrum at the present time and its growth rate. By a combination of brute-force exact computations of likelihoods and Fisher matrix analysis, we investigate how this information, which comes from supernova data only, depends on different survey parameters such as covered area, depth, and duration. We show that, for a survey like The Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and a fixed redshift depth, the same observing time provides the same cosmological information whether one observes a larger area, or a smaller area during more years. We also show that although the peculiar velocity information is peaked in the range z ∈ [ 0 , 0 . 2 ] , there is yet plenty of information in z ∈ [ 0 . 2 , 0 . 5 ] , and for very high supernova number densities there is even more information in the latter range. We conclude that, after 5 years, LSST could measure σ<SUB>8</SUB> with an uncertainty of 0.17 with the current strategy, and that this could be improved to 0.09 if the supernova completeness is improved to 20%. Moreover, we forecast results considering the extra parameter γ, and show that this creates a non-linear degeneracy with σ<SUB>8</SUB> that makes the Fisher matrix analysis inadequate. Finally, we discuss the possibility of achieving competitive results with the current Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PDU....2900519G
