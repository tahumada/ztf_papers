Prospects of Searching for Type Ia Supernovae with 2.5-m Wide Field Survey Telescope,"Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (WDs) and are well-known as a distance indicator. However, it is still unclear how WDs increase their mass near the Chandrasekhar limit and how the thermonuclear runaway happens. The observational clues associated with these open questions, such as the photometric data within hours to days since the explosion, are scarce. Thus, an essential way is to discover SNe Ia at specific epochs with optimal surveys. The 2.5 m Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) is an upcoming survey facility deployed in western China. In this paper, we assess the detectability of SNe Ia with mock observations of the WFST. Followed by the volumetric rate, we generate a spectral series of SNe Ia based on a data-based model and introduce the line-of-sight extinction to calculate the brightness from the observer. By comparing with the detection limit of the WFST, which is affected by the observing conditions, we can count the number of SNe Ia discovered by mock WFST observations. We expect that the WFST can find more than 3.0×104 pre-maximum SNe Ia within one year of running. In particular, the WFST could discover about 45 bright SNe Ia, 99 early phase SNe Ia, or 1.1×104 well-observed SNe Ia with the hypothesized Wide, Deep, or Medium modes, respectively, suggesting that the WFST will be an influential facility in time-domain astronomy.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Univ....9....7H,[]
Constraining the extra polarization modes of gravitational waves with double white dwarfs,"The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new window to test the theory of gravity in the strong field regime. In general relativity (GR), GW can only possess two tensor polarization modes, which are known as the + and × modes. However, vector and scalar modes can exist in some modified theories of gravity, and we can test the gravitational theories by probing these extra polarization modes. As a space-borne GW detector, TianQin will be launched in the 2030s, and it is expected to observe plenty of GW signals, including those from nearly ten thousand double white dwarfs (DWDs) in our galaxy. This offers an excellent chance for testing the existence of extra polarization modes. In this article, we analyze the capability of detecting the extra polarization modes with DWDs. For the extra modes, we consider both the leading order dipole radiation and the sub-leading quadrupole radiation. We find that the capability of TianQin has very strong dependency on the source orientation. We also analyze all the verification binaries with determined position and frequency, and find that ZTF J1539 can give the best constraint on the extra polarization modes. We have also considered the case of TianQin twin constellation, and the joint observation with LISA.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PhRvD.106l4017X,[]
"The Spectroscopic Classification of Astronomical Transients (SCAT) Survey: Overview, Pipeline Description, Initial Results, and Future Plans","We present the Spectroscopic Classification of Astronomical Transients (SCAT) survey, which is dedicated to spectrophotometric observations of transient objects such as supernovae and tidal disruption events. SCAT uses the SuperNova Integral-Field Spectrograph (SNIFS) on the University of Hawai'i 2.2 m (UH2.2m) telescope. SNIFS was designed specifically for accurate transient spectrophotometry, including absolute flux calibration and host-galaxy removal. We describe the data reduction and calibration pipeline including spectral extraction, telluric correction, atmospheric characterization, nightly photometricity, and spectrophotometric precision. We achieve ≲5% spectrophotometry across the full optical wavelength range (3500-9000 Å) under photometric conditions. The inclusion of photometry from the SNIFS multi-filter mosaic imager allows for decent spectrophotometric calibration (10%-20%) even under unfavorable weather/atmospheric conditions. SCAT obtained ≈640 spectra of transients over the first 3 yr of operations, including supernovae of all types, active galactic nuclei, cataclysmic variables, and rare transients such as superluminous supernovae and tidal disruption events. These observations will provide the community with benchmark spectrophotometry to constrain the next generation of hydrodynamic and radiative transfer models.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134l4502T,[]
The first photometric investigation of the poor-thermal contact binary V749 Aurigae,"The multi-filter light curve analysis of V749 Aurigae (thereinafter V0749 Aur) is conducted for the first time. Its orbital period is improved from P = 0.409873 to 0.409890 d in this work. The photometric data from the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) were utilized to examine the revised orbital period. Then, the phased multi-filter light curves were computed with the new period, and analyzed with the Wilson-Devinney (W-D) code. The results reveal that V0749 Aur is a marginal contact binary with a large temperature difference of about ΔT = 1600 K. It is a poor thermal contact binary, the light curves of which depart from EW-type and show EB-type light variations. Thus, V0749 Aur belongs to a particular group of binaries, named B-type binaries, predicted by the Thermal Relaxation Oscillation (TRO) theory. In addition, the amplitude differences in different bands of the light curves, imply the existence of a third light. The contribution of the third light detected by the light curve analysis is consistent with the contribution of a visual star, which is in the same line of sight as V0749 Aur but at a different distance. With its marginal contact and short period properties, V0749 Aur merits further attention as a potential transitional sample in binary evolution.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASJ...74.1421C,[]
PNV J00444033+4113068: Early superhumps with 0.7 mag amplitude and non-red color,"In the first days of WZ Sge-type dwarf nova (DN) outbursts, the 2 : 1 resonance induces a spiral arm structure in the accretion disk, which is observed as early superhumps in optical light curves. We reports on our optical observations of an eclipsing WZ Sge-type DN PNV J00444033+4113068 during its 2021 superoutburst using the 3.8 m Seimei telescope and through the Variable Star Network collaboration. The eclipse analysis showed that its orbital period was 0.055425534(1) d. Our observations confirmed early superhumps with an amplitude of 0.7 mag, the largest amplitude among known WZ Sge-type DNe. More interestingly, its early superhumps became the reddest around their secondary minimum, whereas other WZ Sge-type DNe show the reddest color around the early superhump maximum. The spectrum around the peak of the outburst showed two double-peaked emission lines of He II 4686 Å and Hα with a peak separation of ≥700 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, supporting a very high-inclination system. With the early superhump mapping, the unique profile and color of the early superhump are successfully reproduced by an accretion disk with a vertically extended double arm structure. Therefore, a large amplitude and a unique color behavior of the early superhumps in PNV J00444033+4113068 can be explained by the 2 : 1 resonance model along with other WZ Sge-type DNe.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASJ...74.1287T,[]
Challenges for ΛCDM: An update,"A number of challenges to the standard ΛCDM model have been emerging during the past few years as the accuracy of cosmological observations improves. In this review we discuss in a unified manner many existing signals in cosmological and astrophysical data that appear to be in some tension (2 σ or larger) with the standard ΛCDM model as specified by the Cosmological Principle, General Relativity and the Planck18 parameter values. In addition to the well-studied 5 σ challenge of ΛCDM (the Hubble H<SUB>0</SUB> tension) and other well known tensions (the growth tension, and the lensing amplitude A<SUB>L</SUB> anomaly), we discuss a wide range of other less discussed less-standard signals which appear at a lower statistical significance level than the H<SUB>0</SUB> tension some of them known as 'curiosities' in the data) which may also constitute hints towards new physics. For example such signals include cosmic dipoles (the fine structure constant α, velocity and quasar dipoles), CMB asymmetries, BAO Ly α tension, age of the Universe issues, the Lithium problem, small scale curiosities like the core-cusp and missing satellite problems, quasars Hubble diagram, oscillating short range gravity signals etc. The goal of this pedagogical review is to collectively present the current status (2022 update) of these signals and their level of significance, with emphasis on the Hubble tension and refer to recent resources where more details can be found for each signal. We also briefly discuss theoretical approaches that can potentially explain some of these signals.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022NewAR..9501659P,[]
A very luminous jet from the disruption of a star by a massive black hole,"Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are bursts of electromagnetic energy that are released when supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies violently disrupt a star that passes too close<SUP>1</SUP>. TDEs provide a window through which to study accretion onto supermassive black holes; in some rare cases, this accretion leads to launching of a relativistic jet<SUP>2-9</SUP>, but the necessary conditions are not fully understood. The best-studied jetted TDE so far is Swift J1644+57, which was discovered in γ-rays, but was too obscured by dust to be seen at optical wavelengths. Here we report the optical detection of AT2022cmc, a rapidly fading source at cosmological distance (redshift z = 1.19325) the unique light curve of which transitioned into a luminous plateau within days. Observations of a bright counterpart at other wavelengths, including X-ray, submillimetre and radio, supports the interpretation of AT2022cmc as a jetted TDE containing a synchrotron `afterglow', probably launched by a supermassive black hole with spin greater than approximately 0.3. Using four years of Zwicky Transient Facility<SUP>10</SUP> survey data, we calculate a rate of 0.0 2<SUB>−0.01</SUB><SUP>+0.04</SUP> Gpc<SUP>−3</SUP> yr<SUP>−1</SUP> for on-axis jetted TDEs on the basis of the luminous, fast-fading red component, thus providing a measurement complementary to the rates derived from X-ray and radio observations<SUP>11</SUP>. Correcting for the beaming angle effects, this rate confirms that approximately 1 per cent of TDEs have relativistic jets. Optical surveys can use AT2022cmc as a prototype to unveil a population of jetted TDEs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Natur.612..430A,[]
A nearby long gamma-ray burst from a merger of compact objects,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are flashes of high-energy radiation arising from energetic cosmic explosions. Bursts of long (greater than two seconds) duration are produced by the core-collapse of massive stars<SUP>1</SUP>, and those of short (less than two seconds) duration by the merger of compact objects, such as two neutron stars<SUP>2</SUP>. A third class of events with hybrid high-energy properties was identified<SUP>3</SUP>, but never conclusively linked to a stellar progenitor. The lack of bright supernovae rules out typical core-collapse explosions<SUP>4-6</SUP>, but their distance scales prevent sensitive searches for direct signatures of a progenitor system. Only tentative evidence for a kilonova has been presented<SUP>7,8</SUP>. Here we report observations of the exceptionally bright GRB 211211A, which classify it as a hybrid event and constrain its distance scale to only 346 megaparsecs. Our measurements indicate that its lower-energy (from ultraviolet to near-infrared) counterpart is powered by a luminous (approximately 10<SUP>42</SUP> erg per second) kilonova possibly formed in the ejecta of a compact object merger.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Natur.612..228T,[]
A fast-rising tidal disruption event from a candidate intermediate-mass black hole,"Massive black holes (BHs) at the centres of massive galaxies are ubiquitous. The population of BHs within dwarf galaxies, on the other hand, is not yet known. Dwarf galaxies are thought to harbour BHs with proportionally small masses, including intermediate-mass BHs, with masses 10<SUP>2</SUP> < M<SUB>BH</SUB> < 10<SUP>6</SUP> solar masses (M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). Identification of these systems has historically relied on the detection of light emitted from accreting gaseous disks close to the BHs. Without this light, they are difficult to detect. Tidal disruption events, the luminous flares produced when a star strays close to a BH and is shredded, are a direct way to probe massive BHs. The rise times of these flares theoretically correlate with the BH mass. Here we present AT 2020neh, a fast-rising tidal disruption event candidate, hosted by a dwarf galaxy. AT 2020neh can be described by the tidal disruption of a main sequence star by a 10<SUP>4.7</SUP>-10<SUP>5.9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> BH. We find the observable rate of fast-rising nuclear transients like AT 2020neh to be low, at ≲2 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> events Mpc<SUP>−3</SUP> yr<SUP>−1</SUP>. Finding non-accreting BHs in dwarf galaxies is important to determine how prevalent BHs are within these galaxies, and to constrain models of BH formation. AT 2020neh-like events may provide a galaxy-independent method of measuring the masses of intermediate-mass BHs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022NatAs...6.1452A,[]
Pan-chromatic photometric classification of supernovae from multiple surveys and transfer learning for future surveys,"Time-domain astronomy is entering a new era as wide-field surveys with higher cadences allow for more discoveries than ever before. The field has seen an increased use of machine learning and deep learning for automated classification of transients into established taxonomies. Training such classifiers requires a large enough and representative training set, which is not guaranteed for new future surveys such as the Vera Rubin Observatory, especially at the beginning of operations. We present the use of Gaussian processes to create a uniform representation of supernova light curves from multiple surveys, obtained through the Open Supernova Catalog for supervised classification with convolutional neural networks. We also investigate the use of transfer learning to classify light curves from the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) dataset. Using convolutional neural networks to classify the Gaussian process generated representation of supernova light curves from multiple surveys, we achieve an AUC score of 0.859 for classification into Type Ia, Ibc, and II. We find that transfer learning improves the classification accuracy for the most under-represented classes by up to 18 per cent when classifying PLAsTiCC light curves, and is able to achieve an AUC score of 0.946 ± 0.001 when including photometric redshifts for classification into six classes (Ia, Iax, Ia-91bg, Ibc, II, SLSN-I). We also investigate the usefulness of transfer learning when there is a limited labelled training set to see how this approach can be used for training classifiers in future surveys at the beginning of operations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.tmp.3485B,[]
The orbital evolution of Atira asteroids,"Asteroids having perihelion distance q < 1.3 AU are classified as near-Earth objects (NEOs), which are divided into different sub-groups: Vatira-class, Atira-class, Aten-class, Apollo-class, and Amor-class. 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB>, the first Vatira (Orbiting totally inside Venus' orbit) was discovered by the Twilight project of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) on 2020 January 4. Upon the discovery of 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB>, a couple of orbital studies of the short-term orbital evolution of 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB> have been performed and published (e.g. de la Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente Marcos 2020; Greenstreet 2020). In this work, we performed an assessment of the long-term orbital evolution of known near-Earth objects and known Atiras under the Yarkovsky effect by using the Mercury6 N-body code. We considered not only planetary gravitational perturbation but also the non-gravitational Yarkovsky effect. Our calculation shows that the NEOs have generally two dynamical populations, one short-lived and the other long-lived. From our calculation, the transfer probabilities of Atira-class asteroids to Vatira-class asteroids for the first transition are ~13.1 ± 0.400, ~13.05 ± 0.005, and ~13.25 ± 0.450 ${{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ for different values of the Yarkovsky force (i.e. obliquity of 0, 90, and 180 deg), respectively. It suggests that the radiation force may play some role in the long-term evolution of this asteroid population. Finally, our statistical study implicates that there should be 8.14 ± 0.133 Atira-class asteroids and 1.05 ± 0.075 Vatira-asteroids of the S-type taxonomy.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.5921L,[]
Optical studies of a bright Type Iax supernova SN 2020rea,We present optical photometric and spectroscopic analysis of a Type Iax supernova (SN) 2020rea situated at the brighter luminosity end of Type Iax supernovae (SNe). The light curve decline rate of SN 2020rea is Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(g) = 1.31 ± 0.08 mag which is similar to SNe 2012Z and 2005hk. Modelling the pseudo-bolometric light curve with a radiation diffusion model yields a mass of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni of 0.13 ± 0.01 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and an ejecta mass of 0.77$^{+0.11}_{-0.21}$ M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Spectral features of SN 2020rea during the photospheric phase show good resemblance with SN 2012Z. TARDIS modelling of the early spectra of SN 2020rea reveals a dominance of Iron Group Elements (IGEs). The photospheric velocity of the Si II line around maximum for SN 2020rea is ~ 6500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> which is less than the measured velocity of the Fe II line and indicates significant mixing. The observed physical properties of SN 2020rea match with the predictions of pure deflagration model of a Chandrasekhar mass C-O white dwarf. The metallicity of the host galaxy around the SN region is 12 + log(O/H) = 8.56 ± 0.18 dex which is similar to that of SN 2012Z.,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.5617S,[]
The lure of sirens: joint distance and velocity measurements with third-generation detectors,"The next generation of detectors will detect gravitational waves from binary neutron stars at cosmological distances, for which around a 1000 electromagnetic follow-ups may be observed per year. So far, most work devoted to the expected cosmological impact of these standard sirens employed them only as distance indicators. Only recently their use as tracers of clustering, similar to what already proposed for supernovae, has been studied. Focusing on the expected specifications of the Einstein Telescope (ET), we forecast here the performance on cosmological parameters of future standard sirens as both distance and density indicators, with emphasis on the linear perturbation growth index and on spatial curvature. We improve upon previous studies in a number of ways: a more detailed analysis of available telescope time, the inclusion of more cosmological and nuisance parameters, the Alcock-Paczynski correction, the use of sirens also as both velocity and density tracers, and a more accurate estimation of the distance posterior. We find that the analysis of the clustering of sirens improves the constraints on H<SUB>0</SUB> by 30 per cent and on Ω<SUB>k0</SUB> by over an order of magnitude, with respect to their use merely as distance indicators. With 5 yr of joint ET and Rubin Observatory follow-ups we could reach precision of 0.1 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> in H<SUB>0</SUB> and 0.02 in Ω<SUB>k0</SUB> using only data in the range 0 < z < 0.5. We also find that the use of sirens as tracers of density, and not only velocity, yields good improvements on the growth of structure constraints.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.5449A,[]
Magnetic braking saturates: evidence from the orbital period distribution of low-mass detached eclipsing binaries from ZTF,"We constrain the orbital period (P<SUB>orb</SUB>) distribution of low-mass detached main-sequence eclipsing binaries (EBs) with light-curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which provides a well-understood selection function and sensitivity to faint stars. At short periods (P<SUB>orb</SUB> ≲ 2 d), binaries are predicted to evolve significantly due to magnetic braking (MB), which shrinks orbits and ultimately brings detached binaries into contact. The period distribution is thus a sensitive probe of MB. We find that the intrinsic period distribution of low-mass (0.1 ≲ M<SUB>1</SUB>/M<SUB>⊙</SUB> < 0.9) binaries is basically flat (${\rm d}N/{\rm d}P_{\rm orb} \propto P_{\rm orb}^0$) from P<SUB>orb</SUB> = 10 d down to the contact limit. This is strongly inconsistent with predictions of classical MB models based on the Skumanich relation, which are widely used in binary evolution calculations and predict ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}P_{\rm orb} \propto P_{\rm orb}^{7/3}$ at short periods. The observed distributions are best reproduced by models in which the magnetic field saturates at short periods with a MB torque that scales roughly as $\dot{J}\propto P_{\rm orb}^{-1}$, as opposed to $\dot{J} \propto P_{\rm orb}^{-3}$ in the standard Skumanich law. We also find no significant difference between the period distributions of binaries containing fully and partially convective stars. Our results confirm that a saturated MB law, which was previously found to describe the spin-down of rapidly rotating isolated M dwarfs, also operates in tidally locked binaries. We advocate using saturated MB models in binary evolution calculations. Our work supports previous suggestions that MB in cataclysmic variables (CVs) is much weaker than assumed in the standard evolutionary model, unless mass transfer leads to significant additional angular momentum loss in CVs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.4916E,[]
SN 2019ein: a Type Ia supernova likely originated from a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosion,"We present extensive optical photometric and spectroscopic observations for the nearby Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2019ein, spanning the phases from ~3 to ~330 d after the explosion. This SN Ia is characterized by extremely fast expansion at early times, with initial velocities of Si II and Ca II being above ~25 000-30 000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. After experiencing an unusually rapid velocity decay, the ejecta velocity dropped to ~13 000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> around maximum light. Photometrically, SN 2019ein has a moderate post-peak decline rate (Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(B) = 1.35 ± 0.01 mag), while being fainter than normal SNe Ia by about 40 per cent (with $M^{\rm max}_{B} \approx -18.71 \pm 0.15$ mag). The nickel mass synthesized in the explosion is estimated to be 0.27-0.31 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> from the bolometric light curve. Given such a low nickel mass and a relatively high photospheric velocity, we propose that SN 2019ein likely had a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (WD) progenitor, M<SUB>WD</SUB> ≲ 1.22 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. In this case, the explosion could have been triggered by a double-detonation mechanism, for which 1D and 2D models with WD mass M<SUB>WD</SUB> ≈ 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a helium shell of 0.01 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> can reasonably produce the observed bolometric light curve and spectra. The predicted asymmetry as a result of double detonation is also favoured by the redshifted Fe II and Ni II lines observed in the nebular-phase spectrum. Possible diversity in origin of high velocity SNe Ia is also discussed.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.4098X,[]
The nova KT Eri Is a recurrent nova with a recurrence time-scale of 40-50 yr,"KT Eridani was a very fast nova in 2009 peaking at V = 5.42 mag. We marshal large data sets of photometry to finally work out the nature of KT Eri. From the TESS light curve, as confirmed with our radial velocity curve, we find an orbital period of 2.61595 d. With our 272 spectral energy distributions from simultaneous BVRIJHK measures, the companion star has a temperature of 6200 ± 500 K. Our century-long average in quiescence has V = 14.5. With the Gaia distance (5110$^{+920}_{-430}$ pc), the absolute magnitude is $M_{V_q}$ = +0.7 ± 0.3. We converted this absolute magnitude (corrected to the disc light alone) to accretion rates, $\dot{M}$, with a full integration of the α-disc model. This $\dot{M}$ is very high at 3.5 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Our search and analysis of archival photographs shows that no eruption occurred from 1928 to 1954 or after 1969. With our analysis of the optical light curve, the X-ray light curve, and the radial velocity curve, we derive a white dwarf mass of 1.25 ± 0.03 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. With the high white dwarf mass and very-high $\dot{M}$, KT Eri must require a short time to accumulate the required mass to trigger the next nova event. Our detailed calculations give a recurrence time-scale of 12 yr with a total range of 5-50 yr. When combined with the archival constraints, we conclude that the recurrence time-scale must be between 40 and 50 yr. So, KT Eri is certainly a recurrent nova, with the prior eruption remaining undiscovered in a solar gap of coverage from 1959 to 1969.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.3864S,[]
"Comprehensive listing of 156 reliable orbital periods for novae, including 49 new periods","I report on a large-scale search for the orbital periods (P) of most known nova systems, by looking for significant, coherent, and stable optical photometric modulation in two or more independent light curves taken mostly from the large surveys of TESS, Kepler, AAVSO, SMARTS, OGLE, ASAS, and ZTF. I have discovered 31 new orbital periods. Further, I have measured new periods for 18 novae with evolved companions, to 30 per cent accuracy, as based on their spectral energy distribution. Also, I have confirmed, improved, and rejected prior claims for P in 46 novae. (As part of this effort, I recognize that 5 novae display 1-3 coherent, significant, and transient periodicities 0.12-4.1 d, with these being mysterious as not being the orbital, spin, or superhump periods). In all, I have compiled a comprehensive list of 156 reliable P values for novae. The histogram of nova periods shows a minimum P at 0.059 h (85 min), and a Period Gap from 0.071 to 0.111 d (1.70-2.66 h). The upper edge of the Period Gap is significantly different between novae (0.111 d), nova-like systems (0.131 d), and dwarf novae (0.141 d). A further issue from the histogram is that 31 per cent of nova systems have evolved companions, for which there has been no models or understanding for their current state or evolution. For the novae with red giant companions, 15-out-of-20 are in the bulge population, despite novae with main-sequence and subgiant companions having bulge fractions near 0.11-0.32.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.3640S,[]
Constraints on the Galactic Centre environment from Gaia hypervelocity stars II: The evolved population,"A dynamical encounter between a stellar binary and Sgr A* in the Galactic Centre (GC) can tidally separate the binary and eject one member with a velocity beyond the escape speed of the Milky Way. These hypervelocity stars (HVSs) can offer insight into the stellar populations in the GC environment. In a previous work, our simulations showed that the lack of main sequence HVS candidates with precise astrometric uncertainties and radial velocities in current data releases from the Gaia space mission places a robust upper limit on the ejection rate of HVSs from the GC of $3\times 10^{-2} \, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. We improve this constraint in this work by additionally considering the absence of post-main sequence HVSs in Gaia Early Data Release 3 as well as the existence of the HVS candidate S5-HVS1. This evidence offers degenerate joint constraints on the HVS ejection rate and the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in the GC. For a top-heavy GC IMF as suggested by recent works, our modelling motivates an HVS ejection rate of $\eta =0.7_{-0.5}^{+1.5} \times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. This preferred ejection rate can be as large as $10^{-2} \, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ for a very top-light IMF and as low as 10$^{-4.5} \, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ if the IMF is extremely top-heavy. Constraints will improve further with future Gaia data releases, regardless of how many HVS candidates are found therewithin.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.3469E,[]
Machine learning-based search for cataclysmic variables within Gaia Science Alerts,"Wide-field time domain facilities detect transient events in large numbers through difference imaging. For example, Zwicky Transient Facility produces alerts for hundreds of thousands of transient events per night, a rate set to be dwarfed by the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory. The automation provided by machine learning (ML) is therefore necessary to classify these events and select the most interesting sources for follow-up observations. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are a transient class that are numerous, bright, and nearby, providing excellent laboratories for the study of accretion and binary evolution. Here we focus on our use of ML to identify CVs from photometric data of transient sources published by the Gaia Science Alerts (GSA) program - a large, easily accessible resource, not fully explored with ML. Use of light-curve feature extraction techniques and source metadata from the Gaia survey resulted in a random forest model capable of distinguishing CVs from supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and young stellar objects with a 92 per cent precision score and an 85 per cent hit rate. Of 13 280 sources within GSA without an assigned transient classification our model predicts the CV class for ~2800. Spectroscopic observations are underway to classify a statistically significant sample of these targets to validate the performance of the model. This work puts us on a path towards the classification of rare CV subtypes from future wide-field surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.3362M,[]
Radio observations of the Black Hole X-ray Binary EXO 1846-031 re-awakening from a 34-year slumber,"We present radio [1.3 GHz MeerKAT, 4-8 GHz Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), and 15.5 GHz Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA)] and X-ray (Swift and MAXI) data from the 2019 outburst of the candidate Black Hole X-ray Binary (BHXB) EXO 1846-031. We compute a Hardness-Intensity diagram, which shows the characteristic q-shaped hysteresis of BHXBs in outburst. EXO 1846-031 was monitored weekly with MeerKAT and approximately daily with AMI-LA. The VLA observations provide sub-arcsecond-resolution images at key points in the outburst, showing moving radio components. The radio and X-ray light curves broadly follow each other, showing a peak on ~MJD 58702, followed by a short decline before a second peak between ~MJD 58731-58739. We estimate the minimum energy of these radio flares from equipartition, calculating values of E<SUB>min</SUB> ~ 4 × 10<SUP>41</SUP> and 5 × 10<SUP>42</SUP> erg, respectively. The exact date of the return to 'quiescence' is missed in the X-ray and radio observations, but we suggest that it likely occurred between MJD 58887 and 58905. From the Swift X-ray flux on MJD 58905 and assuming the soft-to-hard transition happened at 0.3-3 per cent Eddington, we calculate a distance range of 2.4-7.5 kpc. We computed the radio:X-ray plane for EXO 1846-031 in the 'hard' state, showing that it is most likely a 'radio-quiet' BH, preferentially at 4.5 kpc. Using this distance and a jet inclination angle of θ = 73°, the VLA data place limits on the intrinsic jet speed of β<SUB>int</SUB> = 0.29c, indicating subluminal jet motion.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.2801W,[]
Star-spots and magnetism: testing the activity paradigm in the Pleiades and M67,"We measure star-spot filling fractions for 240 stars in the Pleiades and M67 open star clusters using APOGEE high-resolution H-band spectra. For this work, we developed a modified spectroscopic pipeline which solves for star-spot filling fraction and star-spot temperature contrast. We exclude binary stars, finding that the large majority of binaries in these clusters (80 per cent) can be identified from Gaia DR3 and APOGEE criteria - important for field star applications. Our data agree well with independent activity proxies, indicating that this technique recovers real star-spot signals. In the Pleiades, filling fractions saturate at a mean level of 0.248 ± 0.005 for active stars with a decline at slower rotation; we present fitting functions as a function of Rossby number. In M67, we recover low mean filling fractions of 0.030 ± 0.008 and 0.003 ± 0.002 for main sequence GK stars and evolved red giants, respectively, confirming that the technique does not produce spurious spot signals in inactive stars. Star-spots also modify the derived spectroscopic effective temperatures and convective overturn time-scales. Effective temperatures for active stars are offset from inactive ones by -109 ± 11 K, in agreement with the Pecaut & Mamajek empirical scale. Star-spot filling fractions at the level measured in active stars changes their inferred overturn time-scale, which biases the derived threshold for saturation. Finally, we identify a population of stars statistically discrepant from mean activity-Rossby relations and present evidence that these are genuine departures from a Rossby scaling. Our technique is applicable to the full APOGEE catalogue, with broad applications to stellar, galactic, and exoplanetary astrophysics.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.2165C,[]
SN 2020wnt: a slow-evolving carbon-rich superluminous supernova with no O II lines and a bumpy light curve,"We present the analysis of SN 2020wnt, an unusual hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I), at a redshift of 0.032. The light curves of SN 2020wnt are characterized by an early bump lasting ~5 d, followed by a bright main peak. The SN reaches a peak absolute magnitude of M$_{r}^{\rm max}=-20.52\pm 0.03$ mag at ~77.5 d from explosion. This magnitude is at the lower end of the luminosity distribution of SLSNe-I, but the rise-time is one of the longest reported to date. Unlike other SLSNe-I, the spectra of SN 2020wnt do not show O II, but strong lines of C II and Si II are detected. Spectroscopically, SN 2020wnt resembles the Type Ic SN 2007gr, but its evolution is significantly slower. Comparing the bolometric light curve to hydrodynamical models, we find that SN 2020wnt luminosity can be explained by radioactive powering. The progenitor of SN 2020wnt is likely a massive and extended star with a pre-SN mass of 80 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a pre-SN radius of 15 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> that experiences a very energetic explosion of 45 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg, producing 4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni. In this framework, the first peak results from a post-shock cooling phase for an extended progenitor, and the luminous main peak is due to a large nickel production. These characteristics are compatible with the pair-instability SN scenario. We note, however, that a significant contribution of interaction with circumstellar material cannot be ruled out.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.2056G,[]
Searching for the next Galactic Luminous red nova,"Luminous red novae (LRNe) are astrophysical transients believed to be caused by the partial ejection of a binary star's common envelope (CE) and the merger of its components. The formation of the CE is likely to occur during unstable mass transfer, initiated by a primary star which is evolving off the main sequence (a Hertzsprung gap star) and a lower mass companion. In agreement with observations, theoretical studies have shown that outflows from the pre-CE phase produce a detectable brightening of the progenitor system a few years before the ejection event. Based on these assumptions, we present a method to identify Galactic LRNe precursors, the resulting precursor candidates, and our follow-up analysis to uncover their nature. We begin by constructing a sample of progenitor systems, i.e. Hertzsprung gap stars, by statistically modelling the density of a colour magnitude diagram formed from 'well behaved' Gaia DR2 sources. Their time-domain evolution from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey is used to search for slowly brightening events, as pre-CE precursor candidates. The nature of the resulting candidates is further investigated using archival data and our own spectroscopic follow-up. Overall, we constructed a sample of ~5.4 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> progenitor sources, from which 21 were identified as candidate LRNe precursors. Further analysis revealed 16 of our candidates to be Hα emitters, with their spectra often suggesting hotter (albeit moderately extincted) A-type or B-type stars. Because of their long-term variability in optical and mid-infrared wavelengths, we propose that many of our candidates are mass-transferring binaries with compact companions surrounded by dusty circumstellar discs or alternatively magnetically active stellar merger remnants.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.1884A,[]
Unveiling the Universe with emerging cosmological probes,"The detection of the accelerated expansion of the Universe has been one of the major breakthroughs in modern cosmology. Several cosmological probes (Cosmic Microwave Background, Supernovae Type Ia, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations) have been studied in depth to better understand the nature of the mechanism driving this acceleration, and they are being currently pushed to their limits, obtaining remarkable constraints that allowed us to shape the standard cosmological model. In parallel to that, however, the percent precision achieved has recently revealed apparent tensions between measurements obtained from different methods. These are either indicating some unaccounted systematic effects, or are pointing toward new physics. Following the development of CMB, SNe, and BAO cosmology, it is critical to extend our selection of cosmological probes. Novel probes can be exploited to validate results, control or mitigate systematic effects, and, most importantly, to increase the accuracy and robustness of our results. This review is meant to provide a state-of-art benchmark of the latest advances in emerging ""beyond-standard"" cosmological probes. We present how several different methods can become a key resource for observational cosmology. In particular, we review cosmic chronometers, quasars, gamma-ray bursts, standard sirens, lensing time-delay with galaxies and clusters, cosmic voids, neutral hydrogen intensity mapping, surface brightness fluctuations, stellar ages of the oldest objects, secular redshift drift, and clustering of standard candles. The review describes the method, systematics, and results of each probe in a homogeneous way, giving the reader a clear picture of the available innovative methods that have been introduced in recent years and how to apply them. The review also discusses the potential synergies and complementarities between the various probes, exploring how they will contribute to the future of modern cosmology.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022LRR....25....6M,[]
Electromagnetic counterparts to massive black-hole mergers,"The next two decades are expected to open the door to the first coincident detections of electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational-wave (GW) signatures associated with massive black-hole (MBH) binaries heading for coalescence. These detections will launch a new era of multimessenger astrophysics by expanding this growing field to the low-frequency GW regime and will provide an unprecedented understanding of the evolution of MBHs and galaxies. They will also constitute fundamentally new probes of cosmology and would enable unique tests of gravity. The aim of this Living Review is to provide an introduction to this research topic by presenting a summary of key findings, physical processes and ideas pertaining to EM counterparts to MBH mergers as they are known at the time of this writing. We review current observational evidence for close MBH binaries, discuss relevant physical processes and timescales, and summarize the possible EM counterparts to GWs in the precursor, coalescence, and afterglow stages of a MBH merger. We also describe open questions and discuss future prospects in this dynamic and quick-paced research area.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022LRR....25....3B,[]
Gravitational waves and electromagnetic transients,"The advanced gravitational wave (GW) detector network has started routine detection of signals from merging compact binaries. Data indicate that in a fair fraction of these sources, at least one component was a neutron star, bringing with it the possibility of electromagnetic (EM) radiation. So far, a confirmed link between EM and GW radiation has been established for only one source, GW170817. Joint analysis of broadband multi-wavelength data and the GW signal have yielded rich information spanning fields as varied as jet physics, cosmology and nucleosynthesis. Here, we discuss the importance of such joint observations, as well as current and near-future efforts to discover and study more EM counterparts to GW sources.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JApA...43...53S,[]
Analysis of dual band and survey photometry of two low mass ratio contact binary systems,"The study presents photometric analysis of the completely eclipsing contact binary systems TYC 8351-1081-1 and ASAS J210406-0522.3. TYC 8351-1081-1 is an extremely low mass ratio (q =0.086 ) system with a high degree of contact (f =0.66 ) while ASAS J210406-0522.3 is found to be in marginal contact (f =0.08 ) with a relatively low-mass ratio of 0.272. There is good thermal contact in both systems with only a small difference in the temperature of the components. The systems have been observed by a number sky surveys over the past 20 years. We compare the light curve solutions from up to three of these surveys and find that survey photometric data manually analysed is robust and yields results comparable to dedicated ground-based photometry. There is evidence of significant luminosity transfer from the primary to the secondary, on the order of 0.5 L<SUB>⊙</SUB> for TYC 8351-1081-1 and 0.06 L<SUB>⊙</SUB> for ASAS J210406-0522.3. There appears to be no change in the period of either system over the past 20 years and theoretical angular momentum loss is below current measurement threshold in both cases. We also show that the mass ratio and separation are well above the theoretical values for orbital instability in both cases. As would be expected, the density of the secondary components is significantly higher relative to the primary.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JApA...43...42W,[]
Optimization of artificial neural networks models applied to the identification of images of asteroids' resonant arguments,"The asteroidal main belt is crossed by a web of mean motion and secular resonances that occur when there is a commensurability between fundamental frequencies of the asteroids and planets. Traditionally, these objects were identified by visual inspection of the time evolution of their resonant argument, which is a combination of orbital elements of the asteroid and the perturbing planet(s). Since the population of asteroids affected by these resonances is, in some cases, of the order of several thousand, this has become a taxing task for a human observer. Recent works used convolutional neural network (CNN) models to perform such task automatically. In this work, we compare the outcome of such models with those of some of the most advanced and publicly available CNN architectures, like the VGG, Inception, and ResNet. The performance of such models is first tested and optimized for overfitting issues, using validation sets and a series of regularization techniques like data augmentation, dropout, and batch normalization. The three best-performing models were then used to predict the labels of larger testing databases containing thousands of images. The VGG model, with and without regularizations, proved to be the most efficient method to predict labels of large datasets. Since the Vera C. Rubin observatory is likely to discover up to four million new asteroids in the next few years, the use of these models might become quite valuable to identify populations of resonant minor bodies.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022CeMDA.134...59C,[]
Search for Tidal Disruption Events Based on the SRG/eROSITA Survey with Subsequent Optical Spectroscopy,"The four completed six-month sky surveys with the eROSITA telescope onboard the SRG orbital observatory allow tidal disruption events (TDEs) in galactic nuclei to be searched for by their X-ray variability. In this case, variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are detected in much larger quantities, for the elimination of which fairly stringent criteria have to be used. Some TDEs can be missed or misclassified as probable AGNs. Optical spectroscopy needs to be performed for the final identification of TDEs among the extragalactic SRG/eROSITA transients. We consider a set of criteria by which TDEs can be distinguished from AGNs based on optical spectra and photometric information. In particular, we propose to use the ratio of the X-ray luminosity to the [O III] 5007 Å luminosity. To test the proposed method, we consider a sample of 15 extragalactic SRG/eROSITA transients whose X-ray flux changed by more than a factor of 7 between two adjacent surveys. Spectra have been taken for all these objects with Russian optical telescopes: RTT-150, AZT-33IK, RC2500, and BTA. We have managed to reveal five new and one previously known TDEs and to classify seven sources as AGNs. The nature of two more transients remains in question. The proposed method will help to set priorities to obtain a maximally complete and reliable sample of TDEs in the SRG/eROSITA survey.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AstL...48..767K,[]
Highly Variable Active Galactic Nuclei in the SRG/eROSITA Sky Survey: I. The Constriction of a Sample and the Catalog of Objects Detected in a Low State,"We present the results of our search for highly variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs) the X-ray flux from which changed by more than an order of magnitude during the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey. Using the eROSITA data obtained in the period from December 2019 to February 2022, we have found 1325 sources the X-ray flux from which in the 0.3-2.3 keV energy band changed by more than a factor of 10 at a confidence level of at least 99.73${%}$. Of them, 635 objects have been classified as AGNs or AGN candidates. We describe the procedure of searching for highly variable sources and the selection of extragalactic objects among them and describe the statistical properties of the produced catalog. We provide a catalog of 49 sources for which a statistically significant flux in their low state was detected. For the latter we provide their light curves and X-ray spectra and discuss in detail the most interesting of them.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AstL...48..735M,[]

Late-time H/He-poor Circumstellar Interaction in the Type Ic Supernova SN 2021ocs: An Exposed Oxygen-Magnesium Layer and Extreme Stripping of the Progenitor,"Supernova (SN) 2021ocs was discovered in the galaxy NGC 7828 (z = 0.01911) within the interacting system Arp 144 and subsequently classified as a normal Type Ic SN around peak brightness. Very Large Telescope/FORS2 observations in the nebular phase at 148 days reveal that the spectrum is dominated by oxygen and magnesium emission lines of different transitions and ionization states: O I, [O I], [O II], [O III], Mg I, and Mg II. Such a spectrum has no counterpart in the literature, though it bears a few features similar to those of some interacting Type Ibn and Icn SNe. Additionally, SN 2021ocs showed a blue color, (g - r) ≲ -0.5 mag, after the peak and up to late phases, atypical for a Type Ic SN. Together with the nebular spectrum, this suggests that SN 2021ocs underwent late-time interaction with an H/He-poor circumstellar medium (CSM) resulting from the pre-SN progenitor mass loss during its final ~1000 days. The strong O and Mg lines and the absence of strong C and He lines suggest that the progenitor star's O-Mg layer is exposed, which places SN 2021ocs as the most extreme case of a massive progenitor star's envelope stripping in interacting SNe, followed by Type Icn (stripped C-O layer) and Ibn (stripped He-rich layer) SNe. This is the first time such a case is reported in the literature. The SN 2021ocs emphasizes the importance of late-time spectroscopy of SNe, even for those classified as normal events, to reveal the inner ejecta and progenitor star's CSM and mass loss. *Based on observations collected at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere under ESO program 108.2282.001.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...941L..32K,[]
Forecasting the Detection Capabilities of Third-generation Gravitational-wave Detectors Using GWFAST,"We introduce GWFAST, a novel Fisher-matrix code for gravitational-wave studies, tuned toward third-generation gravitational-wave detectors such as Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). We use it to perform a comprehensive study of the capabilities of ET alone, and of a network made by ET and two CE detectors, as well as to provide forecasts for the forthcoming O4 run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration. We consider binary neutron stars, binary black holes, and neutron star-black hole binaries, and compute basic metrics such as the distribution of signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), the accuracy in the reconstruction of various parameters (including distance, sky localization, masses, spins, and, for neutron stars, tidal deformabilities), and the redshift distribution of the detections for different thresholds in S/N and different levels of accuracy in localization and distance measurement. We examine the expected distribution and properties of golden events, with especially large values of the S/N. We also pay special attention to the dependence of the results on astrophysical uncertainties and on various technical details (such as choice of waveforms, or the threshold in S/N), and we compare with other Fisher codes in the literature. In the companion paper Iacovelli et al., we discuss the technical aspects of the code. Together with this paper, we publicly release the code GWFAST, (https://github.com/CosmoStatGW/gwfast) and the library WF4Py (https://github.com/CosmoStatGW/WF4Py) implementing state-of-the-art gravitational-wave waveforms in pure Python.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...941..208I,[]
A New Flaring Black Widow Candidate and Demographics of Black Widow Millisecond Pulsars in the Galactic Field,"We present the discovery of a new optical/X-ray source likely associated with the Fermi γ-ray source 4FGL J1408.6-2917. Its high-amplitude periodic optical variability, large spectroscopic radial-velocity semiamplitude, evidence for optical emission lines and flaring, and X-ray properties together imply the source is probably a new black widow millisecond pulsar binary. We compile the properties of the 41 confirmed and suspected field black widows, finding a median secondary mass of 0.027 ± 0.003 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Considered jointly with the more massive redback millisecond pulsar binaries, we find that the ""spider"" companion mass distribution remains strongly bimodal, with essentially zero systems having companion masses of between ~0.07 and 0.1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. X-ray emission from black widows is typically softer and less luminous than in redbacks, consistent with less efficient particle acceleration in the intrabinary shock in black widows, excepting a few systems that appear to have more efficient ""redback-like"" shocks. Together black widows and redbacks dominate the census of the fastest spinning field millisecond pulsars in binaries with known companion types, making up ≳80% of systems with P <SUB>spin</SUB> < 2 ms. Similar to redbacks, the neutron star masses in black widows appear on average significantly larger than the canonical 1.4 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, and many of the highest-mass neutron stars claimed to date are black widows with M <SUB>NS</SUB> ≳ 2.1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Both of these observations are consistent with an evolutionary picture where spider millisecond pulsars emerge from short orbital period progenitors that had a lengthy period of mass transfer initiated while the companion was on the main sequence, leading to fast spins and high masses.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...941..199S,[]
Photometric and Spectroscopic Study of the EXor-like Eruptive Young Star Gaia19fct,"Gaia19fct is one of the Gaia-alerted eruptive young stars that has undergone several brightening events. We conducted monitoring observations using multifilter optical and near-infrared photometry, as well as near-infrared spectroscopy, to understand the physical properties of Gaia19fct and investigate whether it fits into the historically defined two classes. We present the analyses of light curves, color variations, spectral lines, and CO modeling. The light curves show at least five brightening events since 2015, and the multifilter color evolutions are mostly gray. The gray evolution indicates that bursts are triggered by mechanisms other than extinction. Our near-infrared spectra exhibit both absorption and emission lines and show time variability throughout our observations. We found lower rotational velocity and lower temperature from the near-infrared atomic absorption lines than from the optical lines, suggesting that Gaia19fct has a Keplerian rotating disk. The CO overtone features show a superposition of absorption and emission components, which is unlike other young stellar objects. We modeled the CO lines, and the result suggests that the emission and absorption components are formed in different regions. We found that although Gaia19fct exhibits characteristics of both types of eruptive young stars, FU Orionis-type objects and EX Lupi-type objects, it shows more similarity with EXors in general.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...941..165P,[]
The Impact of Initial-Final Mass Relations on Black Hole Microlensing,"Uncertainty in the initial-final mass relation (IFMR) has long been a problem in understanding the final stages of massive star evolution. One of the major challenges of constraining the IFMR is the difficulty of measuring the mass of nonluminous remnant objects (i.e., neutron stars and black holes). Gravitational-wave detectors have opened the possibility of finding large numbers of compact objects in other galaxies, but all in merging binary systems. Gravitational lensing experiments using astrometry and photometry are capable of finding compact objects, both isolated and in binaries, in the Milky Way. In this work we improve the Population Synthesis for Compact object Lensing Events (PopSyCLE) microlensing simulation code in order to explore the possibility of constraining the IFMR using the Milky Way microlensing population. We predict that the Roman Space Telescope's microlensing survey will likely be able to distinguish different IFMRs based on the differences at the long end of the Einstein crossing time distribution and the small end of the microlensing parallax distribution, assuming the small (π <SUB> E </SUB> ≲ 0.02) microlensing parallaxes characteristic of black hole lenses are able to be measured accurately. We emphasize that future microlensing surveys need to be capable of characterizing events with small microlensing parallaxes in order to place the most meaningful constraints on the IFMR.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...941..116R,[]
Luminous Supernovae: Unveiling a Population between Superluminous and Normal Core-collapse Supernovae,"Stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae can be divided into two broad classes: the common Type Ib/c supernovae (SNe Ib/c), powered by the radioactive decay of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni, and the rare superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), most likely powered by the spin-down of a magnetar central engine. Up to now, the intermediate regime between these two populations has remained mostly unexplored. Here, we present a comprehensive study of 40 luminous supernovae (LSNe), SNe with peak magnitudes of M <SUB> r </SUB> = -19 to -20 mag, bound by SLSNe on the bright end and by SNe Ib/c on the dim end. Spectroscopically, LSNe appear to form a continuum between Type Ic SNe and SLSNe. Given their intermediate nature, we model the light curves of all LSNe using a combined magnetar plus radioactive decay model and find that they are indeed intermediate, not only in terms of their peak luminosity and spectra, but also in their rise times, power sources, and physical parameters. We subclassify LSNe into distinct groups that are either as fast evolving as SNe Ib/c or as slow evolving as SLSNe, and appear to be either radioactively or magnetar powered, respectively. Our findings indicate that LSNe are powered by either an overabundant production of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni or by weak magnetar engines, and may serve as the missing link between the two populations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...941..107G,[]
Classifying Unidentified X-Ray Sources in the Chandra Source Catalog Using a Multiwavelength Machine-learning Approach,"The rapid increase in serendipitous X-ray source detections requires the development of novel approaches to efficiently explore the nature of X-ray sources. If even a fraction of these sources could be reliably classified, it would enable population studies for various astrophysical source types on a much larger scale than currently possible. Classification of large numbers of sources from multiple classes characterized by multiple properties (features) must be done automatically and supervised machine learning (ML) seems to provide the only feasible approach. We perform classification of Chandra Source Catalog version 2.0 (CSCv2) sources to explore the potential of the ML approach and identify various biases, limitations, and bottlenecks that present themselves in these kinds of studies. We establish the framework and present a flexible and expandable Python pipeline, which can be used and improved by others. We also release the training data set of 2941 X-ray sources with confidently established classes. In addition to providing probabilistic classifications of 66,369 CSCv2 sources (21% of the entire CSCv2 catalog), we perform several narrower-focused case studies (high-mass X-ray binary candidates and X-ray sources within the extent of the H.E.S.S. TeV sources) to demonstrate some possible applications of our ML approach. We also discuss future possible modifications of the presented pipeline, which are expected to lead to substantial improvements in classification confidences.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...941..104Y,[]
The Double White Dwarf Merger Progenitors of SDSS J2211+1136 and ZTF J1901+1458,"Double white dwarf (DWD) mergers are possibly the leading formation channel of massive, rapidly rotating, high-field magnetic white dwarfs (HFMWDs). However, a direct link connecting a DWD merger to any observed HFMWD is still missing. We here show that the HFMWDs SDSS J221141.80+113604.4 (hereafter J2211+1136) and ZTF J190132.9+145808.7 (hereafter J1901+1458) might be DWD merger products. J2211+1136 is a 1.27 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> white dwarf (WD) with a rotation period of 70.32 s and a surface magnetic field of 15 MG. J1901+1458 is a 1.327-1.365 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> WD with a rotation period of 416.20 s, and a surface magnetic field in the range 600-900 MG. With the assumption of single-star evolution and the currently measured WD masses and surface temperatures, the cooling ages of J2211+1136 and J1901+1458 are, respectively, 2.61-2.85 Gyr and 10-100 Myr. We hypothesize that these WDs are DWD merger products and compute the evolution of the postmerged configuration formed by a central WD surrounded by a disk. We show that the postmerger system evolves through three phases depending on whether accretion, mass ejection (propeller), or magnetic braking dominates the torque onto the central WD. We calculate the time the WD spends in each of these phases and obtain the accretion rate and disk mass for which the WD rotational age, i.e., the total time elapsed since the merger to the instant where the WD central remnant reaches the current measured rotation period, agrees with the estimated WD cooling age. We infer the mass values of the primary and secondary WD components of the DWD merger that lead to a postmerger evolution consistent with the observations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...941...28S,[]
The Periodic Signals of Nova V1674 Herculis (2021),"We present time-series photometry during the early decline phase of the extremely fast nova V1674 Herculis. The 2021 light curve showed periodic signals at 0.152921(3) days and 501.486(5) s, which we interpret as respectively the orbital and white dwarf spin periods in the underlying binary. We also detected a sideband signal at the difference frequency between these two clocks. During the first 15 days of outburst, the spin period appears to have increased by 0.014(1)%. This increase probably arose from the sudden loss of high-angular-momentum gas (""the nova explosion"") from the rotating, magnetic white dwarf. Both periodic signals appeared remarkably early in the outburst, which we attribute to the extreme speed with which the nova evolved (and became transparent to radiation from the inner binary). After that very fast initial period increase of 71 ms, the period subsequently decreased-at 182(18) ms yr<SUP>-1</SUP> in 2021, and 88(18) ms yr<SUP>-1</SUP> in 2022. These rates are ~100× faster than typically seen in intermediate polars. This could be due to high accretion torques from very high mass-transfer rates, which might be common when low-mass donor stars are strongly irradiated by a nova outburst.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940L..56P,[]
Interacting Kilonovae: Long-lasting Electromagnetic Counterparts to Binary Mergers in the Accretion Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei,"We investigate the dynamics and electromagnetic (EM) signatures of neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) or neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) merger ejecta that occur in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We find that the interaction between ejecta and disk gas leads to important effects on the dynamics and radiation. We show five stages of the ejecta dynamics: gravitational slowing down, coasting, Sedov-Taylor deceleration in the disk, reacceleration after the breakout from the disk surface, and momentum-conserved snowplow phase. Meanwhile, the radiation from the ejecta is so bright that its typical peak luminosity reaches a few times 10<SUP>43</SUP>-10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Since most of the radiation energy has converted from the kinetic energy of merger ejecta, we call such an explosive phenomenon an interacting kilonova (IKN). It should be emphasized that IKNe are very promising, bright EM counterparts to NS-NS/BH-NS merger events in AGN disks. The bright peak luminosity and long rising time (i.e., 10 to 20 days in UV bands, 30 to 50 days in optical bands, and 100 days to hundreds of days in IR bands) allow most survey telescopes to have ample time to detect an IKN. However, the peak brightness, peak time, and evolution pattern of the light curve of an IKN are similar to a superluminous supernova in a galactic nucleus and a tidal disruption event making it difficult to distinguish between them. But it also suggests that IKNe might have been present in recorded AGN transients.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940L..44R,[]
Discovery of One Neutron Star Candidate from Radial-velocity Monitoring,"We report the discovery of one possible neutron star binary (P <SUB>orb</SUB> = 0.8666 days) by using LAMOST low-resolution spectroscopic data. The visible companion is a late A-type dwarf (T <SUB>eff</SUB> = 7900 ± 200 K; logg = 4.3 ± 0.2; M = 1.7 ± 0.1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>; R = 1.7 ± 0.2 R <SUB>⊙</SUB>) at a distance of 1.11 ± 0.03 kpc. No double-lined feature can be seen from the Gran Telescopio Canarias/HORuS high-resolution spectra; thus the radial-velocity variation indicates an invisible object hiding in the binary. The system's optical light curves show clear ellipsoidal variability, suggesting that the visible companion is tidal distorted. By fitting the multiband light curves with the eclipsing light-curve (ELC) code and the Wilson-Devinney (WD) code, we constrain the mass of the invisible star to be 1.1-1.3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Spectral disentangling shows no additional component with optical absorption spectra, supporting the idea that the system contains one compact object. No X-ray or UV emission is detected in the ROSAT archive observations. Therefore, we suspect the invisible object is more likely a neutron star rather than a white dwarf. Our finding suggests the ability of LAMOST spectroscopic survey to discover X-ray-quiescent compact objects.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940..165Y,[]
Contracting and Expanding Binary Black Holes in 3D Low-mass AGN Disks: The Importance of Separation,"LIGO/Virgo has detected several binary black hole (BBH) merger events that may have originated in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). These events require individual black hole masses that fall within the pair instability supernova mass gap, and therefore these black holes may have been grown from hierarchical mergers. AGN disks are a prime environment for hierarchical mergers and thus a potential location for the progenitors of BBH gravitational wave events. Understanding how a BBH embedded in an AGN disk interacts with the surrounding environment is thus crucial for determining whether this interaction can lead to its merger. However, there are few high-fidelity simulations of this process, and almost all are two-dimensional. We present the results from 3D, high-resolution, local shearing-box simulations of an embedded BBH interacting with an AGN disk. In these first simulations of their kind, we focus on determining the mass accretion rate and the orbital evolution rate at different BBH separations. We find that circular, equal-mass BBHs with separations greater than 10% of their Hill radius contract while accreting at a super-Eddington rate. At smaller separations, however, our 3D simulations find that BBHs expand their orbits. This result suggests that it may be difficult for an AGN disk to push a BBH to merger, but we discuss several mechanisms, including MHD turbulence and radiative and mechanical feedback, which could alleviate this difficulty.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940..155D,[]
Deep Generative Modeling of Periodic Variable Stars Using Physical Parameters,"The ability to generate physically plausible ensembles of variable sources is critical to the optimization of time domain survey cadences and the training of classification models on data sets with few to no labels. Traditional data augmentation techniques expand training sets by reenvisioning observed exemplars, seeking to simulate observations of specific training sources under different (exogenous) conditions. Unlike fully theory-driven models, these approaches do not typically allow principled interpolation nor extrapolation. Moreover, the principal drawback of theory-driven models lies in the prohibitive computational cost of simulating source observables from ab initio parameters. In this work, we propose a computationally tractable machine learning approach to generate realistic light curves of periodic variables capable of integrating physical parameters and variability classes as inputs. Our deep generative model, inspired by the transparent latent space generative adversarial networks, uses a variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture with temporal convolutional network layers, trained using the OGLE-III optical light curves and physical characteristics (e.g., effective temperature and absolute magnitude) from Gaia DR2. A test using the temperature-shape relationship of RR Lyrae demonstrates the efficacy of our generative ""physics-enhanced latent space VAE"" (PELS-VAE) model. Such deep generative models, serving as nonlinear nonparametric emulators, present a novel tool for astronomers to create synthetic time series over arbitrary cadences.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..263M,[]
"Bridging the Gap-The Disappearance of the Intermediate Period Gap for Fully Convective Stars, Uncovered by New ZTF Rotation Periods","The intermediate period gap, discovered by Kepler, is an observed dearth of stellar rotation periods in the temperature-period diagram at ~20 days for G dwarfs and up to ~30 days for early-M dwarfs. However, because Kepler mainly targeted solar-like stars, there is a lack of measured periods for M dwarfs, especially those at the fully convective limit. Therefore it is unclear if the intermediate period gap exists for mid- to late-M dwarfs. Here, we present a period catalog containing 40,553 rotation periods (9535 periods >10 days), measured using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). To measure these periods, we developed a simple pipeline that improves directly on the ZTF archival light curves and reduces the photometric scatter by 26%, on average. This new catalog spans a range of stellar temperatures that connect samples from Kepler with MEarth, a ground-based time-domain survey of bright M dwarfs, and reveals that the intermediate period gap closes at the theoretically predicted location of the fully convective boundary (G <SUB>BP</SUB> - G <SUB>RP</SUB> ~ 2.45 mag). This result supports the hypothesis that the gap is caused by core-envelope interactions. Using gyro-kinematic ages, we also find a potential rapid spin-down of stars across this period gap.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..251L,[]
Magnetic Interactions in Orbital Dynamics,"The magnetic field of a host star can impact the orbit of a stellar partner, planet, or asteroid if the orbiting body is itself magnetic or electrically conducting. Here, we focus on the instantaneous magnetic forces on an orbiting body in the limit where the dipole approximation describes its magnetic properties as well as those of its stellar host. A permanent magnet in orbit about a star will be inexorably drawn toward the stellar host if the magnetic force is comparable to gravity due to the steep radial dependence of the dipole-dipole interaction. While magnetic fields in observed systems are much too weak to drive a merger event, we confirm that they may be high enough in some close compact binaries to cause measurable orbital precession. When the orbiting body is a conductor, the stellar field induces a time-varying magnetic dipole moment that leads to the possibility of eccentricity pumping and resonance trapping. The challenge is that the orbiter must be close to the stellar host, so that magnetic interactions must compete with tidal forces and the effects of intense stellar radiation.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..229B,[]
Strong lensing time-delay cosmography in the 2020s,"Multiply imaged time-variable sources can be used to measure absolute distances as a function of redshifts and thus determine cosmological parameters, chiefly the Hubble Constant H<SUB>0</SUB>. In the two decades up to 2020, through a number of observational and conceptual breakthroughs, this so-called time-delay cosmography has reached a precision sufficient to be an important independent voice in the current ""Hubble tension"" debate between early- and late-universe determinations of H<SUB>0</SUB>. The 2020s promise to deliver major advances in time-delay cosmography, owing to the large number of lenses to be discovered by new and upcoming surveys and the vastly improved capabilities for follow-up and analysis. In this review, after a brief summary of the foundations of the method and recent advances, we outline the opportunities for the decade and the challenges that will need to be overcome in order to meet the goal of the determination of H<SUB>0</SUB> from time-delay cosmography with 1% precision and accuracy.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&ARv..30....8T,[]
Shell helium-burning hot subdwarf B stars as candidates for blue large-amplitude pulsators,"Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) are a newly discovered type of variable star. Their typical pulsation periods are on the order of a few tens of minutes, with relatively large amplitudes of 0.2-0.4 mag in optical bands, and their rates of period changes are on the order of 10<SUP>−7</SUP> yr<SUP>−1</SUP> (both positive and negative). They are extremely rare objects and attempts to explain their origins and internal structures have attracted a great deal of attention. Previous studies have proposed that BLAPs may be pre-white dwarfs, with masses around 0.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, or core-helium-burning stars in the range of ∼0.7 − 1.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. In this work, we use a number of MESA models to compute and explore whether BLAPs could be explained as shell helium-burning subdwarfs type B (SHeB sdBs). The models that best match existing observational constraints have helium core masses in the range of ∼0.45 − 0.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Our model predicts that the positive rate of period change may evolve to negative. The formation channels for SHeB sdBs involve binary evolution and although the vast majority of BLAPs do not appear to be binaries (with the exception of HD 133729), the observational constraints are still very poor. Motivated by these findings, we explored the Roche lobe overflow channel. Of the 304 binary evolution models we computed, about half of them are able to produce SHeB sdBs in long-period binaries that evade detection from the limited observations that are currently available.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...668A.112X,[]
Examining the dust of the tailless Oort-cloud comet C/2020 T2,"We report our latest analysis of the Oort-cloud comet C/2020 T2 (also named Palomar or T2) observed at 2.06 au from the Sun (phase angle of 28.°5) roughly two weeks before perihelion. It lacks a significant dust tail in scattered light, showing a strong central condensation of the coma throughout the apparition that is reminiscent of so-called Manx comets. Its spectral slope of polarized light increases and decreases in the J (1.25 μm) and H (1.65 μm) bands, respectively, resulting in an overall negative (blue) slope (−0.31 ±0.14% μm<SUP>−1</SUP> ) in contrast to the red polarimetric color of active comets observed at similar geometries. The average polarization degree of T2 is 2.86±0.17% for the J and 2.75±0.16% for the H bands. Given that near-infrared wavelengths are sensitive to the intermediate-scale structure of cometary dust (i.e., dust aggregates), our light-scattering modeling of ballistic aggregates with different porosities and compositions shows that the polarimetric properties of T2 are compatible with low-porosity (~66%), absorbing dust aggregates with negligible ice contents on a scale of 10-100 μm (density of ~652 kg m<SUP>−3</SUP>). This is supported by the coma morphology of T2 which has a viable β (the relative importance of solar radiation pressure on dust particles) range of ≲10<SUP>−4</SUP>. The secular evolution of r-band activity of T2 from archival data reveals that the increase in its brightness accelerates around 2.4 au pre-perihelion, with its overall dust production rate that is about 100 times smaller than those of active Oort-cloud comets. We also found an apparent concentration of T2 and Manx comets toward ecliptic orbits. This paper underlines the heterogeneous nature of Oort-cloud comets, which may be investigated in the near future with dedicated studies of their dust characteristics.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...668A..97K,[]
He-star donor AM CVn stars and their progenitors as LISA sources,Context. Ultracompact cataclysmic variables (CVs) of the AM CVn type are deemed to be important verification sources for the future space gravitational wave detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).,,[]
"Aims: We model the present-day Galactic population of AM CVn stars with He-star donors. Such a population has long expected to exist, though only a couple of candidates are known.",,,[]
Methods: We applied the hybrid method of binary population synthesis (BPS) which combines a simulation of the population of immediate precursors of AM CVn stars by a fast BPS code with subsequent tracking of their evolution by a full evolutionary code.,,,[]
"Results: The model predicts that the present birthrate of He-donor AM CVn stars in the Galaxy is 4.6 × 10<SUP>−4</SUP> yr<SUP>−1</SUP> and the Galaxy may harbour ≃112 000 objects of this class which have orbital periods P ≲ 42 − 43 min. The foreground confusion limit and instrumental noise of LISA prevent the discovery of longer periods systems in gravitational waves. We find that about 500 He-star AM CVns may be detected by LISA with signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) > 5 during a 4 yr mission. Within 1 Kpc from the Sun, there may exist up to 130 He-star AM CVns with the periods in the same range, which may serve as verification binaries, if detected in the electromagnetic spectrum. In the Milky Way, there are also ≃14 800 immediate precursors of AM CVn stars. They are detached systems with a stripped low-mass He-star and a white dwarf companion, out of which about 75 may potentially be observed by LISA during its mission.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...668A..80L,,[]
Structure and evolution of ultra-massive white dwarfs in general relativity,"Context. Ultra-massive white dwarfs (M<SUB>⋆</SUB> ≳ 1.05 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) are of utmost importance in view of the role they play in type Ia supernovae explosions, merger events, the existence of high-magnetic -field white dwarfs, and the physical processes in the super asymptotic giant branch phase.",,[]
Aims: We aim to present the first set of constant rest-mass ultra-massive oxygen-neon white dwarf cooling tracks with masses of M<SUB>⋆</SUB> > 1.29 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> which fully take into account the effects of general relativity on their structural and evolutionary properties.,,,[]
"Methods: We computed the full evolution sequences of 1.29, 1.31, 1.33, 1.35, and 1.369 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> white dwarfs with the La Plata stellar evolution code, LPCODE. For this work, the standard equations of stellar structure and evolution have been modified to include the effects of general relativity. Specifically, the fully general relativistic partial differential equations governing the evolution of a spherically symmetric star are solved in a way so that they resemble the standard Newtonian equations of stellar structure. For comparison purposes, the same sequences have been computed for the Newtonian case.",,,[]
"Results: According to our calculations, the evolutionary properties of the most massive white dwarfs are strongly modified by general relativity effects. In particular, the resulting stellar radius is markedly smaller in the general relativistic case, being up to 25% smaller than predicted by the Newtonian treatment for the more massive ones. We find that oxygen-neon white dwarfs more massive than 1.369 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> become gravitationally unstable with respect to general relativity effects. When core chemical distribution due to phase separation on crystallization is considered, such instability occurs at somewhat lower stellar masses, ≳1.36 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. In addition, cooling times for the most massive white dwarf sequences are about a factor of two smaller than in the Newtonian case at advanced stages of evolution. Finally, a sample of white dwarfs have been identified as ideal candidates to test these general relativistic effects.",,,[]
Conclusions: We conclude that the general relativity effects should be taken into account for an accurate assessment of the structural and evolutionary properties of the most massive white dwarfs. These new ultra-massive white dwarf models constitute a considerable improvement over those computed in the framework of the standard Newtonian theory of stellar interiors.,,,[]

HyperGal: Hyperspectral scene modeling for supernova typing with the SED Machine integral field spectrograph,"Context. Recent developments in time domain astronomy, such as Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), have made it possible to conduct daily scans of the entire visible sky, leading to the discovery of hundreds of new transients every night. Among these detections, 10 to 15 of these objects are supernovae (SNe), which have to be classified prior to cosmological use. The spectral energy distribution machine (SEDM) is a low-resolution (ℛ ~ 100) integral field spectrograph designed, built, and operated with the aim of spectroscopically observing and classifying targets detected by the ZTF main camera.",,[]
"Aims: As the current PYSEDM pipeline can only handle isolated point sources, it is limited by contamination when the transient is too close to its host galaxy core. This can lead to an incorrect typing and ultimately bias the cosmological analyses, affecting the homogeneity of the SN sample in terms of local environment properties. We present a new scene modeler to extract the transient spectrum from its structured background, with the aim of improving the typing efficiency of the SEDM.",,,[]
"Methods: HYPERGAL is a fully chromatic scene modeler that uses archival pre-transient photometric images of the SN environment to generate a hyperspectral model of the host galaxy. It is based on the CIGALE SED fitter used as a physically-motivated spectral interpolator. The galaxy model, complemented by a point source for the transient and a diffuse background component, is projected onto the SEDM spectro-spatial observation space and adjusted to observations, and the SN spectrum is ultimately extracted from this multi-component model. The full procedure, from scene modeling to transient spectrum extraction and typing, is validated on 5000 simulated cubes built from actual SEDM observations of isolated host galaxies, covering a broad range of observing conditions and scene parameters.",,,[]
"Results: We introduce the contrast, c, as the transient-to-total flux ratio at the SN location, integrated over the ZTF r-band. From estimated contrast distribution of real SEDm observations, we show that HYPERGAL correctly classifies ~95% of SNe Ia, and up to 99% for contrast c ≳ 0.2, representing more than 90% of the observations. Compared to the standard point-source extraction method (without the hyperspectral galaxy modeling step), HYPERGAL correctly classifies 20% more SNe Ia between 0.1 < c < 0.6 (50% of the observation conditions), with less than 5% of SN Ia misidentifications. The false-positive rate is less than 2% for c > 0.1 (> 99% of the observations), which represents half as much as the standard extraction method. Assuming a similar contrast distribution for core-collapse SNe, HYPERGAL classifies 14% additional SNe II and 11% additional SNe Ibc.",,,[]
"Conclusions: HYPERGAL has proven to be extremely effective in extracting and classifying SNe in the presence of strong contamination by the host galaxy, providing a significant improvement with respect to the single point-source extraction.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...668A..43L,,[]
Tracing the Milky Way warp and spiral arms with classical Cepheids,"Context. Mapping the Galactic spiral structure is a difficult task since the Sun is located in the Galactic plane and because of dust extinction. For these reasons, molecular masers in radio wavelengths have been used with great success to trace the Milky Way spiral arms. Recently, Gaia parallaxes have helped in investigating the spiral structure in the Solar extended neighborhood.",,[]
"Aims: In this paper, we propose to determine the location of the spiral arms using Cepheids since they are bright, young supergiants with accurate distances (they are the first ladder of the extragalactic distance scale). They can be observed at very large distances; therefore, we need to take the Galactic warp into account.",,,[]
"Methods: Thanks to updated mid-infrared photometry and to the most complete catalog of Galactic Cepheids, we derived the parameters of the warp using a robust regression method. Using a clustering algorithm, we identified groups of Cepheids after having corrected their Galactocentric distances from the (small) effects of the warp.",,,[]
"Results: We derived new parameters for the Galactic warp, and we show that the warp cannot be responsible for the increased dispersion of abundance gradients in the outer disk reported in previous studies. We show that Cepheids can be used to trace spiral arms, even at large distances from the Sun. The groups we identify are consistent with previous studies explicitly deriving the position of spiral arms using young tracers (masers, OB(A) stars) or mapping overdensities of upper main-sequence stars in the Solar neighborhood thanks to Gaia data.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...668A..40L,,[]

A comprehensive analysis yielded a total of 50 classical Cepheids associated with 45 open clusters, of which 39 open cluster-classical Cepheid pairs are considered probable, with the remaining 11 pairs considered improbable but worth following up. Two previously identified clusters by us possibly host classical Cepheids (OC-0125/V1788 Cyg and OC-0675/OGLE-BLG-CEP-114).

Premerger localization of intermediate mass binary black holes with LISA and prospects of joint observations with Athena and LSST,"The planned Laser Interferometric Space Antenna (LISA) will be able to detect gravitational waves (GWs) from intermediate mass binary black holes (IMBBHs) in the mass range ∼10<SUP>2</SUP>- 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> up to a redshift z ∼20 . Modulation effects due to LISA's orbital motion around the Sun facilitate precise premerger localization of the sources, which in turn would help in electromagnetic (EM) followups. In this work, we calculate the uncertainties in sky position, luminosity distance, and time of coalescence as a function of time to coalescence. For representative masses of the IMBBHs, we synthesize a population of binaries uniformly located and oriented on a sphere of radius 3 Gpc and compute the projected parameter measurement uncertainties using the Fisher information matrix. We find that for systems with a total mass of 10<SUP>3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, the errors in the sky position and luminosity distance are ∼0.4 deg<SUP>2</SUP> and ∼6 %, respectively, one day prior to coalescence. The coalescence time can be predicted with an uncertainty ≲10 sec , one day before coalescence. We also find that for 10<SUP>3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, around 40% (100%) of the population has a source localization that is smaller than the field of view of Athena (LSST) one day before the merger. These extremely precise measurements can be used to alert ground-based GW detectors and EM telescopes about the time and location of these mergers. We also discuss mechanisms that may produce EM emission from IMBBH mergers and study its detectability using the planned Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) in the optical and Athena in the x-ray bands. Detection of an EM transient may provide us vital clues about the environments where these mergers occur and the distance estimation can pave the way for cosmography.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PhRvD.106j4015S,[]
A New Period Determination Method for Periodic Variable Stars,"Variable stars play a key role in understanding the Milky Way and the universe. The era of astronomical big data presents new challenges for quick identification of interesting and important variable stars. Accurately estimating the periods is the most important step to distinguish different types of variable stars. Here, we propose a new method of determining the variability periods. By combining the statistical parameters of the light curves, the colors of the variables, the window function and the Generalized Lomb-Scargle (GLS) algorithm, the aperiodic variables are excluded and the periodic variables are divided into eclipsing binaries and NEB variables (other types of periodic variable stars other than eclipsing binaries), the periods of the two main types of variables are derived. We construct a random forest classifier based on 241,154 periodic variables from the ASAS-SN and OGLE data sets of variables. The random forest classifier is trained on 17 features, among which 11 are extracted from the light curves and 6 are from the Gaia Early DR3, ALLWISE, and 2MASS catalogs. The variables are classified into 7 superclasses and 17 subclasses. In comparison with the ASAS-SN and OGLE catalogs, the classification accuracy is generally above approximately 82% and the period accuracy is 70%-99%. To further test the reliability of the new method and classifier, we compare our results with the results of Chen et al. for ZTF DR2. The classification accuracy is generally above 70%. The period accuracy of the EW and SR variables is ~50% and 53%, respectively. And the period accuracy of other types of variables is 65%-98%.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134k4507X,[]
Shock cooling of a red-supergiant supernova at redshift 3 in lensed images,"The core-collapse supernova of a massive star rapidly brightens when a shock, produced following the collapse of its core, reaches the stellar surface. As the shock-heated star subsequently expands and cools, its early-time light curve should have a simple dependence on the size of the progenitor<SUP>1</SUP> and therefore final evolutionary state. Measurements of the radius of the progenitor from early light curves exist for only a small sample of nearby supernovae<SUP>2-14</SUP>, and almost all lack constraining ultraviolet observations within a day of explosion. The several-day time delays and magnifying ability of galaxy-scale gravitational lenses, however, should provide a powerful tool for measuring the early light curves of distant supernovae, and thereby studying massive stellar populations at high redshift. Here we analyse individual rest-frame exposures in the ultraviolet to the optical taken with the Hubble Space Telescope, which simultaneously capture, in three separate gravitationally lensed images, the early phases of a supernova at redshift z ≈ 3 beginning within 5.8 ± 3.1 hours of explosion. The supernova, seen at a lookback time of approximately 11.5 billion years, is strongly lensed by an early-type galaxy in the Abell 370 cluster. We constrain the pre-explosion radius to be 53 3<SUB>−119</SUB><SUP>+154</SUP> solar radii, consistent with a red supergiant. Highly confined and massive circumstellar material at the same radius can also reproduce the light curve, but because no similar low-redshift examples are known, this is unlikely.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Natur.611..256C,[]

Investigation of a likely orbital periodicity of Nova Hercules 2021 in X-rays and γ-rays,"We report a detection of a ~0.153 d period in the classical nova V1674 Her using the NICER observations taken within a month since the outburst (i.e. ~MJD 59405). The X-ray period is consistent with the orbital period previously found in the optical band, strongly suggesting the NICER signal as the X-ray orbital periodicity of the system. A seemingly double-humped profile was obtained by folding the detrended X-ray light curve with the period after removing the rotational X-ray pulsations of the nova. The profile may be caused by occultation by the companion or the accretion disc, possibly indicating a high inclination of the system. The γ-ray emission of V1674 Her with a significance level ≳ 5 σ was detected by Fermi-LAT close to its optical peak and the emission faded away within 1 d, which is the shortest duration known for a γ-ray nova. Folded on 0.153 d, a marginal γ-ray variability can be also seen in the LAT light curve, but without the double-hump feature observed in X-rays. If the γ-ray modulation is real, its origin is probably different from that observed in the X-ray and optical bands.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517L..97L,[]
Modelling the flare in NGC 1097 from 1991 to 2004 as a tidal disruption event,"In the letter, interesting evidence is reported to support a central tidal disruption event (TDE) in the known AGN NGC 1097. Considering the motivations of TDE as one probable origination of emission materials of double-peaked broad emission lines and also as one probable explanation to changing-look AGN, it is interesting to check whether there are clues to support a TDE in NGC 1097, not only a changing-look AGN but also an AGN with double-peaked broad emission lines. Under the assumption that the onset of broad Hα emission was due to a TDE, the 13 yr-long (1991-2004) variability of double-peaked broad Hα line flux in NGC 1097 can be well predicted by theoretical TDE model, with a (1 - 1.5) M<SUB>⊙</SUB> main-sequence star tidally disrupted by the central BH with TDE model determined mass about (5 - 8) × 10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>.

"The discovery and characterization of (594913) 'Ayló'chaxnim, a kilometre sized asteroid inside the orbit of Venus","Near-Earth asteroid population models predict the existence of bodies located inside the orbit of Venus.

(594913) 'Ayló'chaxnim has an aphelion distance of ~0.65 au, is ~2 km in diameter and is red in colour. The detection of such a large asteroid inside the orbit of Venus is surprising given their rarity according to near-Earth asteroid population models.

Both methods are based on the simple idea that if the light curves from a known population of transients can be accurately modelled, any deviations from model predictions are likely anomalies. The first modelling approach is a probabilistic neural network built using Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) and the second is an interpretable Bayesian parametric model of a transient. We demonstrate our methods' ability to provide anomaly scores as a function of time on light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We show that the flexibility of neural networks, the attribute that makes them such a powerful tool for many regression tasks, is what makes them less suitable for anomaly detection when compared with our parametric model. The parametric model is able to identify anomalies with respect to common supernova classes with high precision and recall scores, achieving area under the precision-recall curves above 0.79 for most rare classes such as kilonovae, tidal disruption events, intermediate luminosity transients, and pair-instability supernovae. Our ability to identify anomalies improves over the lifetime of the light curves. Our framework, used in conjunction with transient classifiers, will enable fast and prioritized followup of unusual transients from new large-scale surveys.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517..393M,[]
The 'Giraffe': discovery of a stripped red giant in an interacting binary with an 2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> lower giant,"We report the discovery of a stripped giant + lower giant Algol-type binary, 2M04123153+6738486 (2M0412), identified during a search for non-interacting compact object - star binaries. 2M0412 is an evolved (T<SUB>eff, giant</SUB> ≃ 4000 K), luminous (L<SUB>giant</SUB> ≃ 150 L<SUB>⊙</SUB>) red giant in a circular P = 81.2 d binary. 2M0412 is a known variable star previously classified as a semiregular variable. The cross-correlation functions of follow-up Keck/HIRES and LBT/Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI) spectra show an radial velocity variable second component with implied mass ratio q = M<SUB>giant</SUB>/M<SUB>comp</SUB> ≃ 0.20 ± 0.01. The All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN), Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), Transiting Exoplanet Survey Telescope ( TESS), and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) light curves show that the giant is a Roche lobe filling ellipsoidal variable with an inclination of 49.4 ± 0.3°, and a giant mass of M<SUB>giant</SUB> = 0.38 ± 0.01 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> for a distance of ≃ 3.7 kpc. The mass of the giant indicates that its envelope has been partially stripped. The giant companion on the lower red giant branch has a mass of M<SUB>comp</SUB> = 1.91 ± 0.03 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> with T<SUB>eff, comp</SUB> ≃ 5000 K, L<SUB>comp</SUB> ≃ 60 L<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and R<SUB>comp</SUB> ≃ 11 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The lower giant contributes ${\sim }35{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the flux in the V band. We also identify an orbital phase dependent, broad $\rm H\,\alpha$ emission line which could indicate ongoing accretion from the stripped red giant on to the companion.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.5945J,[]
The emergence of diffused gamma-ray burst afterglows from the discs of active galactic nuclei,"The discs of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have emerged as rich environments for the production and capture of stars and the compact objects that they leave behind. These stars produce long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at their deaths, while frequent interactions among compact objects form binary neutron stars and neutron star-black hole binaries, leading to short GRBs upon their merger. Predicting the properties of these transients as they emerge from the dense environments of AGN discs is key to their proper identification and to better constrain the star and compact object population in AGN discs. Some of these transients would appear unusual because they take place in much higher densities than the interstellar medium. Others, which are the subject of this paper, would additionally be modified by radiation diffusion, since they are generated within optically thick regions of the accretion discs. Here, we compute the GRB afterglow light curves for diffused GRB sources for a representative variety of central black hole masses and disc locations. We find that the radiation from radio to ultraviolet and soft X-rays can be strongly suppressed by synchrotron self-absorption in the dense medium of the AGN disc. In addition, photon diffusion can significantly delay the emergence of the emission peak, turning a beamed, fast transient into a slow, isotropic, and dimmer one. These would appear as broad-band correlated AGN variability with a dominance at the higher frequencies. Their properties can constrain both the stellar populations within AGN discs and the disc structure.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.5935W,[]
Discovering faint and high apparent motion rate near-Earth asteroids using a deep learning program,"Although many near-Earth objects have been found by ground-based telescopes, some fast-moving ones, especially those near detection limits, have been missed by observatories. We developed a convolutional neural network for detecting faint fast-moving near-Earth objects. It was trained with artificial streaks generated from simulations and was able to find these asteroid streaks with an accuracy of 98.7 per cent and a false positive rate of 0.02 per cent on simulated data. This program was used to search image data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in four nights in 2019, and it identified six previously undiscovered asteroids. The visual magnitudes of our detections range from ~19.0 to 20.3 and motion rates range from ~6.8 to 24 deg d<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is very faint compared to other ZTF detections moving at similar motion rates. Our asteroids are also ~1-51 m diameter in size and ~5-60 lunar distances away at close approach, assuming their albedo values follow the albedo distribution function of known asteroids. The use of a purely simulated data set to train our model enables the program to gain sensitivity in detecting faint and fast-moving objects while still being able to recover nearly all discoveries made by previously designed neural networks which used real detections to train neural networks. Our approach can be adopted by any observatory for detecting fast-moving asteroid streaks.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.5785W,[]
"Orphan optical flare as SOSS emission afterglow, localization in time","We report on MASTER optical observations of an afterglow-like optical and X-ray transient AT2021lfa/ZTF21aayokph.

On the diversity of magnetar-driven kilonovae,"A non-negligible fraction of binary neutron star mergers are expected to form long-lived neutron star remnants, dramatically altering the multimessenger signatures of a merger. Here, we extend existing models for magnetar-driven kilonovae and explore the diversity of kilonovae and kilonova afterglows. Focusing on the role of the (uncertain) magnetic field strength, we study the resulting electromagnetic signatures as a function of the external dipolar and internal toroidal fields. These two parameters govern, respectively, the competition between magnetic-dipole spin-down and gravitational-wave spin-down (due to magnetic-field deformation) of the rapidly rotating remnant. We find that even in the parameter space where gravitational-wave emission is dominant, a kilonova with a magnetar central engine will be significantly brighter than one without an engine, as this parameter space is where more of the spin-down luminosity is thermalized. In contrast, a system with minimal gravitational-wave emission will produce a kilonova that may be difficult to distinguish from ordinary kilonovae unless early epoch observations are available. However, as the bulk of the energy in this parameter space goes into accelerating the ejecta, such a system will produce a brighter kilonova afterglow that will peak in shorter times. To effectively hide the presence of the magnetar from the kilonova and kilonova afterglow, the rotational energy inputted into the ejecta must be ≲10<SUP>-3</SUP>to 10<SUP>-2</SUP>E<SUB>rot</SUB>. We discuss the different diagnostics available to identify magnetar-driven kilonovae in serendipitous observations and draw parallels to other potential magnetar-driven explosions, such as superluminous supernovae and broad-line supernovae Ic.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.4949S,[]
A detailed study of the barium central star of the planetary nebula Abell 70,"We present a detailed study of the barium star at the heart of the planetary nebula Abell 70. Time-series photometry obtained over a period of more than 10 yr demonstrates that the barium-contaminated companion is a rapid rotator with temporal variability due to spots. The amplitude and phasing of the photometric variability change abruptly; however, there is no evidence for a change in the rotation period (P = 2.06 d) over the course of the observations. The co-addition of 17 high-resolution spectra obtained with Ultraviolet and Visual Échelle Spectrograph mounted on the Very Large Telescope allows us to measure the physical and chemical properties of the companion, confirming it to be a chromospherically active, late G-type sub-giant with more than +1 dex of barium enhancement. We find no evidence of radial velocity variability in the spectra, obtained over the course of approximately 130 d with a single additional point some 8 yr later, with the radial velocities of all epochs approximately -10 km s <SUP>-1</SUP> from the previously measured systemic velocity of the nebula. This is perhaps indicative that the binary has a relatively long period (P ≳ 2 yr) and high eccentricity (e ≳ 0.3), and that all the observations were taken around radial velocity minimum. However, unless the binary orbital plane is not aligned with the waist of the nebula or the systemic velocity of the binary is not equal to the literature value for the nebula, this would imply an unfeasibly large mass for the nebular progenitor.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.4833J,[]
Constraining R<SUB>V</SUB> variation using highly reddened Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ sample,"Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are powerful tools for measuring the expansion history of the Universe, but the impact of dust around SNe Ia remains unknown and is a critical systematic uncertainty. One way to improve our empirical description of dust is to analyse highly reddened SNe Ia [E(B - V) > 0.4, roughly equivalent to the fitted SALT2 light-curve parameter c > 0.3]. With the recently released Pantheon+ sample, there are 57 SNe Ia that were removed because of their high colour alone (with colours up to c = 1.61), which can provide enormous leverage on understanding line-of-sight R<SUB>V</SUB>. Previous studies have claimed that R<SUB>V</SUB> decreases with redder colour, though it is unclear if this is due to limited statistics, selection effects, or an alternative explanation. To test this claim, we fit two separate colour-luminosity relationships, one for the main cosmological sample (c < 0.3) and one for highly reddened (c > 0.3) SNe Ia. We find the change in the colour-luminosity coefficient to be consistent with zero. Additionally, we compare the data to simulations with different colour models, and find that the data prefers a model with a flat dependence of R<SUB>V</SUB> on colour over a declining dependence. Finally, our results strongly support that line-of-sight R<SUB>V</SUB> to SNe Ia is not a single value, but forms a distribution.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.4822R,[]
Multiple flares caused by mass ejection episodes during the advanced nebular phase of Nova Scuti 2019,"Our photometric and spectroscopic monitoring shows that starting with 2020 June 4, day +217 from optical maximum and well into its advanced nebular stage, Nova Scuti (Nova Sct) 2019 begun displaying a series of nine large amplitude flares (up to $\Delta m \sim 1.7$ mag), characterized by a rapid rise to peak (≤10 h) and a fast exponential decline (e-folding time ~50 h). The time interval Δt between flares follows an ordered sequence, declining from 8.43 to 4.90 d, that safely allows to exclude that any other flare occurred without being recorded by the observations. When the sequence of flares was over by 2020 July 28 (day +271), Nova Sct 2019 slowed its overall decline rate from Δm = 0.0067 to 0.0027 mag d<SUP>-1</SUP>. The flares were caused by material expelled at high velocity (~1000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) from the still burning white dwarf (WD). The cooler pseudo-photosphere forming at each flare in the expelled material, resulted in a recombination wave to spread through the original nova ejecta (at ~170 au from the WD), quenching emission from [Fe X] and [Fe VII] and boosting that from lower ionization species. After each flare, once the small amount of expelled material had turned optically thin, the original nova ejecta resumed displaying [Fe X] and [Fe VII] emission lines, a fact that clearly proves the direct photoionization action exerted on the ejecta by the burning WD. While the other known flaring novae (V458 Vul, V4745 Sgr, and V5588 Sgr) presented the flares close to maximum brightness and with increasing Δt, Nova Sct 2019 is unique in having displayed them during the advanced nebular stage and with decreasing Δt.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.4805M,[]
Numerical relativity simulations of the neutron star merger GW190425: microphysics and mass ratio effects,"GW190425 was the second gravitational wave (GW) signal compatible with a binary neutron star (BNS) merger detected by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Since no electromagnetic counterpart was identified, whether the associated kilonova was too dim or the localization area too broad is still an open question. We simulate 28 BNS mergers with the chirp mass of GW190425 and mass ratio 1 ≤ q ≤ 1.67, using numerical-relativity simulations with finite-temperature, composition dependent equations of state (EOS) and neutrino radiation. The energy emitted in GWs is $\lesssim 0.083\mathrm{\, M_\odot }c^2$ with peak luminosity of 1.1-$2.4\times ~10^{58}/(1+q)^2\, {\rm {erg \, s^{-1}}}$. Dynamical ejecta and disc mass range between 5 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP>-10<SUP>-3</SUP> and 10<SUP>-5</SUP>-$0.1 \mathrm{\, M_\odot }$, respectively. Asymmetric mergers, especially with stiff EOSs, unbind more matter and form heavier discs compared to equal mass binaries. The angular momentum of the disc is 8-$10\mathrm{\, M_\odot }~GM_{\rm {disc}}/c$ over three orders of magnitude in M<SUB>disc</SUB>. While the nucleosynthesis shows no peculiarity, the simulated kilonovae are relatively dim compared with GW170817. For distances compatible with GW190425, AB magnitudes are always dimmer than ~20 mag for the B, r, and K bands, with brighter kilonovae associated to more asymmetric binaries and stiffer EOSs. We suggest that, even assuming a good coverage of GW190425's sky location, the kilonova could hardly have been detected by present wide-field surveys and no firm constraints on the binary parameters or EOS can be argued from the lack of the detection.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.4760C,[]
GROWTH on S190426c II: GROWTH-India Telescope search for an optical counterpart with a custom image reduction and candidate vetting pipeline,"S190426c/GW190426_152155 was the first probable neutron star-black hole merger candidate detected by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration. We undertook a tiled search for optical counterparts of this event using the 0.7-m GROWTH-India Telescope. Over a period of two weeks, we obtained multiple observations over a 22.1 deg<SUP>2</SUP> area, with a 17.5 per cent probability of containing the source location. Initial efforts included obtaining photometry of sources reported by various groups, and a visual search for sources in all galaxies contained in the region. Subsequently, we have developed an image subtraction and candidate vetting pipeline with $\sim 94{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ efficiency for transient detection. Processing the data with this pipeline, we find several transients, but none that are compatible with kilonova models.

The recurrent nova U Scorpii from the 2010.1 to 2022.4 eruptions; the missed eruption of 2016.78 ± 0.10 and the critical complex period changes,"U Sco is a recurrent nova with 11 observed eruptions, most recently in 2010.1 and 2022.4. I report on my program (running since 1989) of measuring eclipse times and brightnesses of U Sco in quiescence, from 2010 to 2022. The orbital period suddenly increased by +22.4 ± 1.0 parts-per-million across the 2010.1 eruption. This period change is greater than the near-zero period change (+3.9 ± 6.1 parts-per-million) across the 1999.2 eruption. This period change cannot come from any of the usual mechanisms, whereas the one remaining possibility is that the period changes are dominated by the little-known mechanism of the nova ejecting asymmetric shells. From 2010.1 to 2016.78, the O - C curve showed a steady period change that was large, with $\dot{P}$ = (-21.0 ± 3.2) × 10<SUP>-9</SUP>. This is greatly higher than the steady period changes in the two previous inter-eruption intervals (-3.2 ± 1.9 and -1.1 ± 1.1 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP>). This large, variable, and negative $\dot{P}$ apparently comes from magnetic braking of the companion star's rotation. Starting in 2016.9 ± 0.6, the O - C curve showed a strong kink that is a unique characteristic of the sudden period change (+35.4 ± 7.1 parts-per-million) across a nova event. The brightness in quiescence after 2010.4 shows that the white dwarf accreted the trigger mass for the next nova event in the year 2017.1 ± 0.6. Photometric records show the only possible time for the eruption to peak (such that its total duration of 60 d was undetectable by any observation) is during a 75-d interval inside the 2016 solar gap, thus constraining the missed eruption to 2016.78 ± 0.10.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.4497S,[]
A 3.8 yr optical quasi-periodic oscillations in blue quasar SDSS J132144+033055 through combined light curves from CSS and ZTF,"In the manuscript, a 3.8 yr optical quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) is reported in blue quasar SDSS J132144+033055 (= SDSS J1321) at z = 0.269, based on 16.3yr-long light curve from both CSS and ZTF directly described by a sinusoidal function. The 3.8 yr QPOs can be confirmed through the Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram with confidence level higher than 5σ, through properties of the phase-folded light curve and the WWZ technique. Moreover, the collected Pan-STARRS light curves well follow the sinusoidal function described best fitting results to the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) and Catalina Sky Survey (ZTF) light curves. The optical QPOs strongly indicate a central binary black hole (BBH) system in SDSS J1321, with expected space separation smaller than 0.018 pc, through the estimated upper limit of total BH mass 3.3 × 10<SUP>9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> through the correlation between BH mass and continuum luminosity. Meanwhile, we check disc precession applied to explain the optical QPOs. However, under the disc precession assumption, the determined optical emission regions from central BH have sizes about 37R<SUB>G</SUB> similar as the sizes 35R<SUB>G</SUB> of the expected NUV emission regions through the correlation between disc size and BH mass, indicating the disc precession is not preferred. And due to undetected radio emissions, jet precession can be ruled out. Furthermore, only 0.1 per cent probability can determined as the QPOs mis-detected through CAR process randomly created light curves related to intrinsic AGN activities, re-confirming the optical QPOs with significance level higher than 3σ. Therefore, combining long-term light curves from CSS and ZTF can lead to more QPOs candidates in the near future.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.3650Z,[]
Birth of a Be star: an APOGEE search for Be stars forming through binary mass transfer,"Motivated by recent suggestions that many Be stars form through binary mass transfer, we searched the APOGEE survey for Be stars with bloated, stripped companions. From a well-defined parent sample of 297 Be stars, we identified one mass-transfer binary, HD 15124. The object consists of a main-sequence Be star ($M_{\rm Be}=5.3\pm 0.6\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$) with a low-mass ($M_{\rm donor}=0.92\pm 0.22\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$), subgiant companion on a 5.47-d orbit. The emission lines originate in an accretion disc caused by ongoing mass transfer, not from a decretion disc as in classical Be stars. Both stars have surface abundances bearing imprint of CNO processing in the donor's core: the surface helium fraction is Y<SUB>He</SUB> ≈ 0.6, and the nitrogen-to-carbon ratio is 1000 times the solar value. The system's properties are well-matched by binary evolution models in which mass transfer begins while a $3-5\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$ donor leaves the main sequence, with the originally less massive component becoming the Be star. These models predict that the system will soon become a detached Be + stripped star binary like HR 6819 and LB-1, with the stripped donor eventually contracting to become a core helium-burning sdO/B star. Discovery of one object in this short-lived (~1 Myr) evolutionary phase implies the existence of many more that have already passed through it and are now Be + sdO/B binaries. We infer that $(10-60)\, {{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of Be stars have stripped companions, most of which are $\sim 100\, \times$ fainter than the Be stars in the optical. Together with the dearth of main-sequence companions to Be stars and recent discovery of numerous Be + sdO/B binaries in the UV, our results imply that binarity plays an important role in the formation of Be stars.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.3602E,[]
Short-duration accretion states of Polars as seen in TESS and ZTF data,"Polars are highly magnetic cataclysmic variables which have been long observed to have both high and low brightness states. The duration of these states has been previously seen to vary from a number of days up to years. Despite this, these states and their physical origin have not been explained in a consistent manner. We present observations of the shortest duration states of a number of Polars observed by ZTF and TESS. This has allowed us to determine that short-duration states are a relatively common feature across the population of Polars. Furthermore, we have been able to generalize the model of star-spot migration to explain both short-lived high and low states in Polars by incorporating the interaction between the magnetic field of the white dwarf and that of the star spots.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.3144D,[]
Physical analysis of Yukawa-Casimir traversable wormhole solutions in non-minimally coupled f(T) gravity,"This article is based on the analysis of wormhole geometries in the perspective of non-minimal torsion-matter coupled gravity. In this work, we consider an explicit non-minimal coupling between an impulsive function of torsion scalar and the Lagrangian density of matter. In this exploration, we propose two profiles of energy densities for two non-minimally coupled f(T) gravity models and graphical plots are analyzed for different viable solutions. Wormhole solutions obtained from these models corresponding to Casimir profile violate null energy condition, whereas solutions corresponding to Yukawa-Casimir profile satisfy the null energy condition to support the wormhole geometries. Moreover, we also examine the stability of obtained solutions through Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and it exhibits that our calculated results are stable.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022EPJP..137.1274J,[]
Strongly Lensed Transient Sources: A Review,"The past decades have witnessed a lot of progress in gravitational lensing with two main targets: stars and galaxies (with active galactic nuclei). The success is partially attributed to the continuous luminescence of these sources making the detection and monitoring relatively easy. With the running of ongoing and upcoming large facilities/surveys in various electromagnetic and gravitational-wave bands, the era of time-domain surveys would guarantee constant detection of strongly lensed explosive transient events, for example, supernovae in all types, gamma ray bursts with afterglows in all bands, fast radio bursts, and even gravitational waves. Lensed transients have many advantages over the traditional targets in studying the Universe, and magnification effect helps to understand the transients themselves at high redshifts. In this review article, on base of the recent achievements in literature, we summarize the methods of searching for different kinds of lensed transient signals, the latest results on detection and their applications in fundamental physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.

The First Detection of an Orphan Burst at the Rise Phase,"We report on the earliest detection of the optical transient MASTER OT J123248.62-012924.5 coincident within the error box with the optical and X-ray transient AT2021lfa/ZTF21aayokph. In our images the brightness of the object rises monotonically with $7σ$ confidence. We interpret this transient as a gamma-ray burst (GRB) characterized by smooth optical self-similar (SOSS) emission, while the nondetection of gamma-ray emission at space observatories is interpreted in terms of the hypothesis of a ``failed'' GRB. Thus, this is the first detection of a nonmonotonic orphan burst.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AstL...48..623L,[]
Extreme Mass Loss in Low-mass Type Ib/c Supernova Progenitors,"Many core-collapse supernovae (SNe) with hydrogen-poor and low-mass ejecta, such as ultra-stripped SNe and type Ibn SNe, are observed to interact with dense circumstellar material (CSM). These events likely arise from the core collapse of helium stars that have been heavily stripped by a binary companion and have ejected significant mass during the last weeks to years of their lives. In helium star models run to days before core collapse we identify a range of helium core masses ≈2.5-3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> whose envelopes expand substantially due to the helium shell burning while the core undergoes neon and oxygen burning. When modeled in binary systems, the rapid expansion of these helium stars induces extremely high rates of late-stage mass transfer ( $\dot{M}rsim {10}^{-2}\,{M}_{\odot }\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$ Ṁ≳10-2M⊙yr-1 ) beginning weeks to decades before core collapse. We consider two scenarios for producing CSM in these systems: either mass transfer remains stable and mass loss is driven from the system in the vicinity of the accreting companion, or mass transfer becomes unstable and causes a common envelope event (CEE) through which the helium envelope is unbound. The ensuing CSM properties are consistent with the CSM masses (~10<SUP>-2</SUP>-1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) and radii (~10<SUP>13</SUP>-10<SUP>16</SUP> cm) inferred for ultra-stripped SNe and several type Ibn SNe. Furthermore, systems that undergo a CEE could produce short-period neutron star binaries that merge in less than 100 Myr.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940L..27W,[]
Orbital Decay of Double White Dwarfs: Beyond Gravitational-wave Radiation Effects,"The traditional description of the orbital evolution of compact-object binaries, like double white dwarfs (DWDs), assumes that the system is driven only by gravitational-wave (GW) radiation. However, the high magnetic fields with intensities of up to gigagausses measured in WDs alert a potential role of the electromagnetic (EM) emission in the evolution of DWDs. We evaluate the orbital dynamics of DWDs under the effects of GW radiation, tidal synchronization, and EM emission by a unipolar inductor generated by the magnetic primary and the relative motion of the nonmagnetic secondary. We show that the EM emission can affect the orbital dynamics for magnetic fields larger than megagausses. We applied the model to two known DWDs, SDSS J0651+2844 and ZTF J1539+5027, for which the GW radiation alone does not fully account for the measured orbital decay rate. We obtain upper limits to the primary's magnetic field strength, over which the EM emission causes an orbital decay faster than observed. The contribution of tidal locking and the EM emission is comparable, and together they can contribute up to 20% to the measured orbital decay rate. We show that the gravitational waveform for a DWD modeled as purely driven by GWs and including tidal interactions and EM emission can have large relative dephasing detectable in the mHz regime of frequencies relevant for space-based detectors like LISA. Therefore, including physics besides GW radiation in the waveform templates is essential to calibrate the GW detectors using known sources, e.g., ZTF J1539+5027, and to infer binary parameters.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940...90C,[]
Active Galactic Nuclei Continuum Reverberation Mapping Based on Zwicky Transient Facility Light Curves,"We perform a systematic survey of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) continuum lags using ~3 days cadence gri-band light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We select a sample of 94 type 1 AGNs at z < 0.8 with significant and consistent inter-band lags based on the interpolated cross-correlation function method and the Bayesian method JAVELIN. Within the framework of the ""lamp-post"" reprocessing model, our findings are: (1) The continuum emission (CE) sizes inferred from the data are larger than the disk sizes predicted by the standard thin-disk model. (2) For a subset of the sample, the CE size exceeds the theoretical limit of the self-gravity radius (12 lt-days) for geometrically thin disks. (3) The CE size scales with continuum luminosity as R <SUB>CE</SUB> ∝ L <SUP>0.48±0.04</SUP> with a scatter of 0.2 dex, analogous to the well-known radius-luminosity relation of broad Hβ. These findings suggest a significant contribution of diffuse continuum emission from the broad-line region (BLR) to AGN continuum lags. We find that the R <SUB>CE</SUB>-L relation can be explained by a photoionization model that assumes ~23% of the total flux comes from the diffuse BLR emission. In addition, the ratio of the CE size and model-predicted disk size anticorrelates with the continuum luminosity, which is indicative of a potential nondisk BLR lag contribution evolving with the luminosity. Finally, a robust positive correlation between the CE size and black hole mass is detected.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940...20G,[]
Perfecting Our Set of Spectrophotometric Standard DA White Dwarfs,"We verified for photometric stability a set of DA white dwarfs with Hubble Space Telescope magnitudes from the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared and ground-based spectroscopy by using time-spaced observations from the Las Cumbres Observatory network of telescopes. The initial list of 38 stars was whittled to 32 final ones, which comprise a high-quality set of spectrophotometric standards. These stars are homogeneously distributed around the sky and are all fainter than r ~ 16.5 mag. Their distribution is such that at least two of them would be available to be observed from any observatory on the ground at any time at airmass less than 2. Light curves and different variability indices from the Las Cumbres Observatory data were used to determine the stability of the candidate standards. When available, Pan-STARRS1, Zwicky Transient Facility, and TESS data were also used to confirm the star classification. Our analysis showed that four DA white dwarfs may exhibit evidence of photometric variability, while a fifth is cooler than our established lower temperature limit, and a sixth star might be a binary. In some instances, due to the presence of faint nearby red sources, care should be used when observing a few of the spectrophotometric standards with ground-based telescopes. Light curves and finding charts for all the stars are provided.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940...19C,[]
The Luminosity Function of Tidal Disruption Flares for the ZTF-I Survey,"The high-cadence survey of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) has completely dominated the discovery of tidal disruption events (TDEs) in the past few years and resulted in the largest sample of TDEs with optical/UV light curves well sampled around their peaks, providing us an excellent opportunity to construct a peak luminosity function (LF) of tidal disruption flares (TDFs). The new construction is necessary particularly considering that the most updated LF reported in literature has been inferred from only 13 sources from five different surveys. Here we present the optical and blackbody LFs calculated by 33 TDFs discovered in the ZTF-I survey. The optical LF can be described by both a power-law profile ${dN}/{{dL}}_{g}\propto {L}_{g}^{-2.3\pm 0.2}$ , and a Schechter-like function. The blackbody LF can be described by a power-law profile ${dN}/{{dL}}_{\mathrm{bb}}\propto {L}_{\mathrm{bb}}^{-2.2\pm 0.2}$ , shallower than the LF made of the previous van Velzen (2018) sample. A possible low-luminosity turnover in the optical LF supports an Eddington-limited emission scenario. The drop of the volumetric rate at high luminosity suggests a rate suppression due to direct captures of the black hole. The total volumetric rate is 1 order of magnitude lower than the previous estimation, which is probably not simply caused by the high fraction postpeak sources (7/13) in the previous sample. Instead, the normalization step during the previous LF construction to reconcile various surveys might adversely amplify the influence of serendipitous discoveries. Therefore, TDFs selected from ongoing and upcoming uniform surveys like ZTF, Vera Rubin Observatory, and the Wide-Field Survey Telescope should yield more accurate LFs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...939L..33L,[]
"A Transient ""Changing-look"" Active Galactic Nucleus Resolved on Month Timescales from First-year Sloan Digital Sky Survey V Data","We report the discovery of a new ""changing-look"" active galactic nucleus (CLAGN) event, in the quasar SDSS J162829.17+432948.5 at z = 0.2603, identified through repeat spectroscopy from the fifth Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V). Optical photometry taken during 2020-2021 shows a dramatic dimming of Δg ≈ 1 mag, followed by a rapid recovery on a timescale of several months, with the ≲2 month period of rebrightening captured in new SDSS-V and Las Cumbres Observatory spectroscopy. This is one of the fastest CLAGN transitions observed to date. Archival observations suggest that the object experienced a much more gradual dimming over the period of 2011-2013. Our spectroscopy shows that the photometric changes were accompanied by dramatic variations in the quasar-like continuum and broad-line emission. The excellent agreement between the pre- and postdip photometric and spectroscopic appearances of the source, as well as the fact that the dimmest spectra can be reproduced by applying a single extinction law to the brighter spectral states, favor a variable line-of-sight obscuration as the driver of the observed transitions. Such an interpretation faces several theoretical challenges, and thus an alternative accretion-driven scenario cannot be excluded. The recent events observed in this quasar highlight the importance of spectroscopic monitoring of large active galactic nucleus samples on weeks-to-months timescales, which the SDSS-V is designed to achieve.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...939L..16Z,[]
Spectral Evolution of Dark Asteroid Surfaces Induced by Space Weathering over a Decade,"The surfaces of airless bodies like asteroids in the solar system are known to be affected by space weathering. Experiments simulating space weathering are essential for studying the effects of this process on meteorite samples, but the problem is that the time spent to reproduce space weathering in these experiments is billions of times shorter than the actual phenomenon. In 2010 December, the T-type asteroid 596 Scheila underwent a collision with an impactor a few tens of meters in size. A decade later, there is an opportunity to study how the surface layer of this asteroid is being altered by space weathering after the impact. To do so, we performed visible spectrophotometric and near-infrared spectroscopic observations of 596 Scheila. The acquired spectrum is consistent with those observed shortly after the 2010 impact event within the observational uncertainty range. This indicates that the surface color of dark asteroids is not noticeably changed by space weathering over a 10 yr period. This study is the first to investigate color changes due to space weathering on an actual asteroid surface in the solar system. Considering that fresh layers are regularly created on asteroid surfaces by collisions, we suggest a genetic link between D/T-type and dark (low albedo) X-complex asteroids and very red objects such as 269 Justitia, 732 Tjilaki, and 203 Pompeja. New observations show that 203 Pompeja has an X-type-like surface, with some local surface areas exhibiting a very red spectrum.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...939L...9H,[]
Seven Years of Coordinated Chandra-NuSTAR Observations of SN 2014C Unfold the Extreme Mass-loss History of Its Stellar Progenitor,"We present the results from our 7 yr long broadband X-ray observing campaign of SN 2014C with Chandra and NuSTAR. These coordinated observations represent the first look at the evolution of a young extragalactic SN in the 0.3-80 keV energy range in the years after core collapse. We find that the spectroscopic metamorphosis of SN 2014C from an ordinary type Ib SN into an interacting SN with copious hydrogen emission is accompanied by luminous X-rays reaching L <SUB> x </SUB> ≈ 5.6 × 10<SUP>40</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> (0.3-100 keV) at ~1000 days post-explosion and declining as L <SUB> x </SUB> ∝ t <SUP>-1</SUP> afterwards. The broadband X-ray spectrum is of thermal origin and shows clear evidence for cooling after peak, with $T{(t)\approx 20\,\mathrm{keV}(t/{t}_{\mathrm{pk}})}^{-0.5}$ . Soft X-rays of sub-keV energy suffer from large photoelectric absorption originating from the local SN environment with ${\mathrm{NH}}_{\mathrm{int}}{(t)\approx 3\times {10}^{22}(t/400\,\mathrm{days})}^{-1.4}\,{\mathrm{cm}}^{-2}$ . We interpret these findings as the result of the interaction of the SN shock with a dense (n ≈ 10<SUP>5</SUP> - 10<SUP>6</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>), H-rich disk-like circumstellar medium (CSM) with inner radius ~2 × 10<SUP>16</SUP> cm and extending to ~10<SUP>17</SUP> cm. Based on the declining NH<SUB>int</SUB>(t) and X-ray luminosity evolution, we infer a CSM mass of ~(1.2 f-2.0 $\sqrt{f}){M}_{\odot }$ , where f is the volume filling factor. We place SN 2014C in the context of 121 core-collapse SNe with evidence for strong shock interaction with a thick circumstellar medium. Finally, we highlight the challenges that the current mass-loss theories (including wave-driven mass loss, binary interaction, and line-driven winds) face when interpreting the wide dynamic ranges of CSM parameters inferred from observations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...939..105B,[]
Detecting Magnetospheric Radio Emission from Giant Exoplanets,"As radio astronomy enters a golden age, ground-based observatories are reaching sensitivities capable of unlocking a new and exciting field of exoplanet observation. Radio observation of planetary auroral emission provides unique and complementary insight into planetary science not available via orthodox exoplanet observation techniques. Supplying the first measurements of planetary magnetic fields, rotation rates, and orbital obliquities, we gain necessary and crucial insight into our understanding of the star-planet relationships, geophysics, composition, and habitability of exoplanets. Using a stellar-wind-driven Jovian approximation, we present analytical methods for estimating magnetospheric radio emission from confirmed exoplanets. Predicted radio fluxes from cataloged exoplanets are compared against the wavelengths and sensitivities of current and future observatories. Candidate exoplanets are downselected based on the sky coverage of each ground-based observatory. Orbits of target exoplanets are modeled to account for influential orbit-dependent effects in anticipating time-varying exoplanet radio luminosity and flux. To evaluate the angular alignment of exoplanetary beamed emission relative to Earth's position, the equatorial latitude of exoplanetary auroral emission is compared against Earth's apparent latitude on the exoplanet. Predicted time-dependent measurements and recommended beamformed observations for ground-based radio arrays are provided, along with a detailed analysis of the anticipated emission behavior for τ Boo b.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...939...24A,[]
Spectropolarimetry of the Thermonuclear Supernova SN 2021rhu: High Calcium Polarization 79 Days after Peak Luminosity,"We report spectropolarimetric observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN) SN 2021rhu at four epochs: -7, +0, +36, and +79 days relative to its B-band maximum luminosity. A wavelength-dependent continuum polarization peaking at 3890 ± 93 Å and reaching a level of ${p}_{\max }\,=\,1.78 \% \pm 0.02$ % was found. The peak of the polarization curve is bluer than is typical in the Milky Way, indicating a larger proportion of small dust grains along the sight line to the SN. After removing the interstellar polarization, we found a pronounced increase of the polarization in the Ca II near-infrared triplet, from ~0.3% at day -7 to ~2.5% at day +79. No temporal evolution in high-resolution flux spectra across the Na I D and Ca II H and K features was seen from days +39 to +74, indicating that the late-time increase in polarization is intrinsic to the SN as opposed to being caused by scattering of SN photons in circumstellar or interstellar matter. We suggest that an explanation for the late-time rise of the Ca II near-infrared triplet polarization may be the alignment of calcium atoms in a weak magnetic field through optical excitation/pumping by anisotropic radiation from the SN.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...939...18Y,[]
SALT3-NIR: Taking the Open-source Type Ia Supernova Model to Longer Wavelengths for Next-generation Cosmological Measurements,"A large fraction of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) observations over the next decade will be in the near-infrared (NIR), at wavelengths beyond the reach of the current standard light-curve model for SN Ia cosmology, SALT3 (~2800-8700 Å central filter wavelength). To harness this new SN Ia sample and reduce future light-curve standardization systematic uncertainties, we train SALT3 at NIR wavelengths (SALT3-NIR) up to 2 μm with the open-source model-training software SALTshaker, which can easily accommodate future observations. Using simulated data, we show that the training process constrains the NIR model to ~2%-3% across the phase range (-20 to 50 days). We find that Hubble residual (HR) scatter is smaller using the NIR alone or optical+NIR compared to optical alone, by up to ~30% depending on filter choice (95% confidence). There is significant correlation between NIR light-curve stretch measurements and luminosity, with stretch and color corrections often improving HR scatter by up to ~20%. For SN Ia observations expected from the Roman Space Telescope, SALT3-NIR increases the amount of usable data in the SALT framework by ~20% at redshift z ≲ 0.4 and by ~50% at z ≲ 0.15. The SALT3-NIR model is part of the open-source SNCosmo and SNANA SN Ia cosmology packages.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...939...11P,[]
GLEAM-X J162759.5−523504.3 as a white dwarf pulsar,"The low frequency radio source GLEAM-X J162759.5−523504.3 emits pulsed coherent polarized emission like that of radio pulsars. Yet its period of 18.18 min (1091 s) is hundreds of times longer than those of confirmed radio pulsars, and if it is a neutron star its mean radiated power exceeds the upper limit on its spin-down power by more than an order of magnitude. This may be explained if it is a white dwarf pulsar, with a moment of inertia several orders of magnitude greater than those of neutron stars. The Lorentz factor of the emitting charge bunches may be bounded from below by the widths of the temporal substructure of their radiation. If the emission is curvature radiation, the radius of curvature may be estimated from the Lorentz factor and the frequencies of emission; it is consistent with a white dwarf's inner magnetosphere but not a neutron star's.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Ap&SS.367..108K,[]
Kepler and the Behemoth: Three Mini-Neptunes in a 40 Million Year Old Association,"Stellar positions and velocities from Gaia are yielding a new view of open cluster dispersal. Here we present an analysis of a group of stars spanning Cepheus (l = 100°) to Hercules (l = 40°), hereafter the Cep-Her complex. The group includes four Kepler objects of interest: Kepler-1643 b (R <SUB>p</SUB> = 2.32 ± 0.13 R <SUB>⊕</SUB>, P = 5.3 days), KOI-7368 b (R <SUB>p</SUB> = 2.22 ± 0.12 R <SUB>⊕</SUB>, P = 6.8 days), KOI-7913 Ab (R <SUB>p</SUB> = 2.34 ± 0.18 R <SUB>⊕</SUB>, P = 24.2 days), and Kepler-1627 Ab (R <SUB>p</SUB> = 3.85 ± 0.11 R <SUB>⊕</SUB>, P = 7.2 days). The latter Neptune-sized planet is in part of the Cep-Her complex called the δ Lyr cluster. Here we focus on the former three systems, which are in other regions of the association. Based on kinematic evidence from Gaia, stellar rotation periods from TESS, and spectroscopy, these three objects are also ≈40 million years (Myr) old. More specifically, we find that Kepler-1643 is ${46}_{-7}^{+9}$ Myr old, based on its membership in a dense subcluster of the complex called RSG-5. KOI-7368 and KOI-7913 are ${36}_{-8}^{+10}$ Myr old, and are in a diffuse region that we call CH-2. Based on the transit shapes and high-resolution imaging, all three objects are most likely planets, with false-positive probabilities of 6 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP>, 4 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP>, and 1 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> for Kepler-1643, KOI-7368, and KOI-7913, respectively. These planets demonstrate that mini-Neptunes with sizes of ≈2 Earth radii exist at ages of 40 Myr.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..215B,[]
Extremely Low Mass Ratio Contact Binaries. I. The First Photometric and Spectroscopic Investigations of Ten Systems,"The photometric and spectroscopic investigations of ten contact binaries were presented for the first time. It is discovered that the mass ratios of all the ten targets are smaller than 0.15, they are extremely low mass ratio contact binaries. Seven of them are deep contact binaries, two are medium contact binaries, while only one is a shallow contact system. Five of them show the O'Connell effect, and a dark spot on one of the two components can lead to a good fit of the asymmetric light curves. The orbital period studies of the ten binaries reveal that they all exhibit long-term period changes, six of them are increasing, while the others are shrinking. The LAMOST spectra were analyzed by the spectral subtraction method, and all the ten targets exhibit excess emissions in the H<SUB> α </SUB> line, indicating chromospheric activity. The evolutionary states of the two components of the ten binaries were studied, and it is found that their evolutionary states are identical to those of the other contact binaries. Based on the study of the relation between orbital angular momentum and total mass, we discovered the ten systems may be at the late evolutionary stage of a contact binary. The initial masses of the two components and the ages of them were obtained. By calculating the instability parameters, we found that the ten contact binaries are relatively stable at present.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..202L,[]
Fast Derivation of Contact Binary Parameters for Large Photometric Surveys,"Thanks to an enormous release of light curves of contact binaries, it is a challenge to derive the parameters of contact binaries using the Phoebe program and the Wilson-Devinney program with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. In this paper, we use neural network (NN) and MCMC algorithm to derive the parameters of contact binaries. The fitting of models is still done with the MCMC algorithm, but that the neural network is used to establish the mapping relationship between the parameters and the light curves generated beforehand by Phoebe. The NN model is trained with a set of Phoebe-generated light curves with known input parameters, and then combined with the MCMC algorithm to quickly obtain the posterior distribution of the parameters. Two NN models without and with the influence of third light are established, which can generate light curves with 100 points faster than Phoebe by about four orders of magnitude under the same running condition. In addition, the two models can generate the light curves with an error of less than a millimagnitude. The feasibility of NN and MCMC algorithm is also verified by the synthetic light curves generated by Phoebe and the light curves from Kepler survey data. NN and MCMC algorithms can quickly derive the parameters and the corresponding parameter errors of contact binaries from sky survey. These parameters can also be used as more precise initial input values for the objectives of individual detailed studies.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..200D,[]
DELIGHT: Deep Learning Identification of Galaxy Hosts of Transients using Multiresolution Images,"We present DELIGHT, or Deep Learning Identification of Galaxy Hosts of Transients, a new algorithm designed to automatically and in real time identify the host galaxies of extragalactic transients. The proposed algorithm receives as input compact, multiresolution images centered at the position of a transient candidate and outputs two-dimensional offset vectors that connect the transient with the center of its predicted host. The multiresolution input consists of a set of images with the same number of pixels, but with progressively larger pixel sizes and fields of view. A sample of 16,791 galaxies visually identified by the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events broker team was used to train a convolutional neural network regression model. We show that this method is able to correctly identify both relatively large (10″ < r < 60″) and small (r ≤ 10″) apparent size host galaxies using much less information (32 kB) than with a large, single-resolution image (920 kB). The proposed method has fewer catastrophic errors in recovering the position and is more complete and has less contamination (<0.86%) recovering the crossmatched redshift than other state-of-the-art methods. The more efficient representation provided by multiresolution input images could allow for the identification of transient host galaxies in real time, if adopted in alert streams from new generation of large -etendue telescopes such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..195F,[]
Zwicky Transient Facility and Globular Clusters: The Period-Luminosity and Period-Wesenheit Relations for Anomalous Cepheids Supplemented with Large Magellanic Cloud Sample,"We present the first gri-band period-luminosity (PL) and period-Wesenheit (PW) relations for the fundamental mode anomalous Cepheids. These PL and PW relations were derived from a combined sample of five anomalous Cepheids in globular cluster M92 and the Large Magellanic Cloud, both of which have distance accurate to ~1% available from literature. Our g-band PL relation is similar to the B-band PL relation as reported in previous study. We applied our PL and PW relations to anomalous Cepheids discovered in dwarf galaxy Crater II, and found a larger but consistent distance modulus than the recent measurements based on RR Lyrae. Our calibrations of gri-band PL and PW relations, even though less precise due to small number of anomalous Cepheids, will be useful for distance measurements to dwarf galaxies.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..191N,[]
Supernova double-peaked light curves from double-nickel distribution,"Among supernovae (SNe) of different luminosities, many double-peaked light curves (LCs) have been observed, representing a broad morphological variety. In this work, we investigate which of these can be modelled by assuming a double-peaked distribution of their radioactive material, as originally proposed for SN2005bf. The inner zone corresponds to the regular explosive nucleosynthesis and extends outwards, according to the usual scenario of mixing. The outer <SUP>56</SUP>Ni-rich shell may be related to the effect of jet-like outflows that have interacted with more distant portions of the star before the arrival of the SN shock. As the outer layer is covered by matter that is optically less thick, its energy emerges earlier and generates a first peak of radiation. To investigate this scenario in more detail, we have applied our hydrodynamic code that follows the shock propagation through the progenitor star and takes into account the effect of the γ-ray photons produced by the decay of the radioactive isotopes. We present a simple parametric model for the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni abundance profile and explore the consequences on the LC of individually varying the quantities that define this distribution, setting our focus onto the stripped-envelope progenitors. In this first study, we are interested in the applicability of this model to SNe that have not been classified as superluminous, thus, we have selected our parameter space accordingly. Then, within the same mathematical prescription for the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni -profile, we revisited the modelling process for a series of objects: SN2005bf, PTF2011mnb, SN2019cad, and SN2008D. In some cases, a decrease in the gamma ray opacity is required to fit the late time observations. We also discuss the other cases in which this scenario might be likely to explain the LC morphology. A steep initial decline in the observed bolometric LC within less than few days after the explosion becomes less feasible for this model, because it requires a large abundance of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni near the stellar surface, indicating a strongly inverted distribution. An initial bolometric rise before the two peaks seems more favourable for the double-nickel case, particularly as it can be difficult to explain through other scenarios, unless a combination of power sources is invoked.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...667A..92O,[]
Satellite shadows through stellar occultations,,,[]
Aims: The impact of mega-constellations of satellites in low-Earth orbit during nighttime optical observations is assessed.,,,[]
Methods: Orbital geometry is used to calculate the impact of stellar occultations by satellites on the photometry of individual stars as well as the effect on the photometric calibration of wide-field observations.,,,[]
"Results: Starlink-type satellites will have occultation disks several arcseconds across. Together with occultation crossing times of 0.1−100 ms, this will lead to photometric `jitter' on the flux determination of stars. The level of impact for a given star depends on the ratio of the integration time of the frame over the occultation crossing time. In current-day CCD-based synoptic surveys, this impact is negligible (≪1%), but with future CMOS-based wide-field surveys obtaining data at frequencies >1 Hz, the impact will grow towards complete dropouts. At integration times similar to the occultation crossing time, the orbit of a satellite can be traced using the occultation method. At even shorter integration times, the shape of the occulting satellite can be deduced.",,,[]
"Conclusions: Stellar occultations by passing satellites, enabled by high-speed CMOS technology, will be a new method for studying orbiting satellites. Large-scale monitoring programs will be needed to independently determine and update the orbits of satellites.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...667A..45G,,[]
Tests of gravitational-wave birefringence with the open gravitational-wave catalog,"We report the results of testing gravitational-wave birefringence using the largest population of gravitational-wave events currently available. Gravitational-wave birefringence, which can arise from the effective field theory extension of general relativity, occurs when the parity symmetry is broken, causing the left- and right-handed polarizations to propagate following different equations of motion. We perform Bayesian inference on the 94 events reported by the 4th-Open Gravitational-wave Catalog (4-OGC) using a parity-violating waveform. We find no evidence for a violation of general relativity in the vast majority of events. However, the most massive event, GW190521, and the second most massive event, GW191109, show intriguing nonzero results for gravitational-wave birefringence. We find that the probability of association between GW190521 and the possible electromagnetic (EM) counterpart reported by Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is increased when assuming birefringence. Excluding GW190521 and GW191109, the parity-violating energy scale is constrained to M<SUB>PV</SUB>>0.05 GeV at 90% credible interval, which is an improvement over previous results from twelve events by a factor of five. We discuss the implications of our results on modified gravity and possible alternative explanations such as waveform systematics. More detections of massive binary black hole mergers from the upcoming LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA run will shed light on the true origin of the apparent birefringence.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PhRvD.106h4005W,[]
SNAD transient miner: Finding missed transient events in ZTF DR4 using k-D trees,"We report the automatic detection of 11 transients (7 possible supernovae and 4 active galactic nuclei candidates) within the Zwicky Transient Facility fourth data release (ZTF DR4), all of them observed in 2018 and absent from public catalogs. Among these, three were not part of the ZTF alert stream. Our transient mining strategy employs 41 physically motivated features extracted from both real light curves and four simulated light curve models (SN Ia, SN II, TDE, SLSN-I). These features are input to a k-D tree algorithm, from which we calculate the 15 nearest neighbors. After pre-processing and selection cuts, our dataset contained approximately a million objects among which we visually inspected the 105 closest neighbors from seven of our brightest, most well-sampled simulations, comprising 89 unique ZTF DR4 sources. Our result illustrates the potential of coherently incorporating domain knowledge and automatic learning algorithms, which is one of the guiding principles directing the SNAD team. It also demonstrates that the ZTF DR is a suitable testing ground for data mining algorithms aiming to prepare for the next generation of astronomical data.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022NewA...9601846A,[]
A dense 0.1-solar-mass star in a 51-minute-orbital-period eclipsing binary,"Of more than a thousand known cataclysmic variables (CVs), where a white dwarf is accreting from a hydrogen-rich star, only a dozen have orbital periods below 75 minutes<SUP>1-9</SUP>. One way to achieve these short periods requires the donor star to have undergone substantial nuclear evolution before interacting with the white dwarf<SUP>10-14</SUP>, and it is expected that these objects will transition to helium accretion. These transitional CVs have been proposed as progenitors of helium CVs<SUP>13-18</SUP>. However, no known transitional CV is expected to reach an orbital period short enough to account for most of the helium CV population, leaving the role of this evolutionary pathway unclear. Here we report observations of ZTF J1813+4251, a 51-minute-orbital-period, fully eclipsing binary system consisting of a star with a temperature comparable to that of the Sun but a density 100 times greater owing to its helium-rich composition, accreting onto a white dwarf. Phase-resolved spectra, multi-band light curves and the broadband spectral energy distribution allow us to obtain precise and robust constraints on the masses, radii and temperatures of both components. Evolutionary modelling shows that ZTF J1813+4251 is destined to become a helium CV binary, reaching an orbital period under 20 minutes, rendering ZTF J1813+4251 a previously missing link between helium CV binaries and hydrogen-rich CVs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Natur.610..467B,[]
Persistence of the blazar state in flat-spectrum radio quasars,"Flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), whose brightness is dominated by a relativistically beamed core, are frequently found in the 'blazar state' commonly inferred from a high optical polarization (> 3 per cent) and/or a large continuum variability. Here we use these two prime optical markers to investigate continuance of an FSRQ in the blazar (or non-blazar) state over an exceptionally long time baseline spanning four decades. Our basic sample is a well-defined, unbiased set of 80 FSRQs whose blazar state stood confirmed during the 1980s from optical polarimetry. Four decades later, the blazar state of each FSRQ is ascertained here from variability of their optical light curves with a typical duration of ~3.5 yr, a low noise (rms ~2 per cent) and good cadence (~3 d), obtained under the Zwicky Transient Facility project, which has been ongoing since 2018. For about 40 per cent of these FSRQs, the blazar state could be ascertained additionally from the opto-polarimetric survey RoboPol (2013-2017). From both these data bases, it is found that only ~10 per cent of the FSRQs have undergone a blazar ↔ non-blazar state transition over the past three to four decades. This reinforces the case for the long-term stability of the blazar state in individual FSRQs, despite their state fluctuating more commonly on year-like time-scales.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516L..18C,[]
Dwarf AGNs from Optical Variability for the Origins of Seeds (DAVOS): insights from the dark energy survey deep fields,"We present a sample of 706, z < 1.5 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) selected from optical photometric variability in three of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) deep fields (E2, C3, and X3) over an area of 4.64 deg<SUP>2</SUP>. We construct light curves using difference imaging aperture photometry for resolved sources and non-difference imaging PSF photometry for unresolved sources, respectively, and characterize the variability significance. Our DES light curves have a mean cadence of 7 d, a 6-yr baseline, and a single-epoch imaging depth of up to g ~ 24.5. Using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, we find 26 out of total 706 variable galaxies are consistent with dwarf galaxies with a reliable stellar mass estimate ($M_{\ast } 10^{9.5}\, {\rm M}_\odot$; median photometric redshift of 0.9). We were able to constrain rapid characteristic variability time-scales (~ weeks) using the DES light curves in 15 dwarf AGN candidates (a subset of our variable AGN candidates) at a median photometric redshift of 0.4. This rapid variability is consistent with their low black hole (BH) masses. We confirm the low-mass AGN nature of one source with a high S/N optical spectrum. We publish our catalogue, optical light curves, and supplementary data, such as X-ray properties and optical spectra, when available. We measure a variable AGN fraction versus stellar mass and compare to results from a forward model. This work demonstrates the feasibility of optical variability to identify AGNs with lower BH masses in deep fields, which may be more 'pristine' analogues of supermassive BH seeds.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.2736B,[]
Candidate and confirmed ultrashort period main-sequence binary stars,"The lower tail of the period distribution of main-sequence binary stars is poorly constrained due to the small number of such systems known. This paper deals with candidate binary stars with periods shorter than 0.2 d and colour indices consistent with them being M dwarfs. Three sources of candidates are considered - a catalogue of TESS eclipsing binaries, the ATLAS catalogue of variable stars, and binary stars from the 'International Variable Star Index' (VSX) website. The TESS eclipsing binary catalogue contains five new candidates satisfying the period and colour criteria. New photometry confirms one as a bona fide main-sequence system, and another as a white dwarf/red dwarf pair. New multicolour light curves of 10 ATLAS stars are presented: 7 of these are main sequence binaries with confirmed ultrashort periods (P < 0.2 d). There are 328 red VSX binary candidates with short periods. Literature searches for 77 of these with P < 0.17 d were performed: only 6 are previously studied main sequence systems, and another 14 are known red dwarf/white dwarf systems.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.2540K,[]
Estimating sizes of type-2 AGN narrow-line regions from multiple survey spectra - a demonstration,"In the Letter, an interesting method is proposed to estimate size of narrow emission-lines regions (NLRs) of a type-2 AGN SDSS J083823.91 + 490241.1 (=SDSS J0838) at a redshift of 0.101, by comparing spectroscopic properties through the SDSS fibre (MJD = 51873) (diameter of 3 arcsec) and through the eBOSS fibre (MJD = 55277) (diameter of 2 arcsec). After subtractions of PPXF method determined host galaxy contributions, the narrow emission lines of SDSS J0838 in the SDSS spectrum and in the eBOSS spectrum can be well measured by Gaussian functions, leading more than 90 per cent of [O III] emissions to be covered by the eBOSS fibre with diameter of 2 arcsec. Meanwhile, both none broad emission components and none-variabilities of ZTF 3 yr-long g-/r-band light curves can be applied to confirm SDSS J0838 as a type-2 AGN, indicating few orientation effects on the projected NLRs size in SDSS J0838. Therefore, upper limit about 1 arcsec (2250 pc) of the NLRs size can be reasonably accepted in SDSS J0838. Combining with the intrinsic reddening corrected [O III] line luminosity, the upper limit of NLRs size in SDSS J0838 well lies within the 99.9999 per cent confidence bands of the R-L empirical relation for NLRs in AGN.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.2470Z,[]
ASAS-SN follow-up of IceCube high-energy neutrino alerts,"We report on the search for optical counterparts to IceCube neutrino alerts released between 2016 April and 2021 August with the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN). Despite the discovery of a diffuse astrophysical high-energy neutrino flux in 2013, the source of those neutrinos remains largely unknown. Since 2016, IceCube has published likely astrophysical neutrinos as public real-time alerts. Through a combination of normal survey and triggered target-of-opportunity observations, ASAS-SN obtained images within 1 h of the neutrino detection for 20 per cent (11) of all observable IceCube alerts and within one day for another 57 per cent (32). For all observable alerts, we obtained images within at least two weeks from the neutrino alert. ASAS-SN provides the only optical follow-up for about 17 per cent of IceCube's neutrino alerts. We recover the two previously claimed counterparts to neutrino alerts, the flaring-blazar TXS 0506 + 056 and the tidal disruption event AT2019dsg. We investigate the light curves of previously detected transients in the alert footprints, but do not identify any further candidate neutrino sources. We also analysed the optical light curves of Fermi 4FGL sources coincident with high-energy neutrino alerts, but do not identify any contemporaneous flaring activity. Finally, we derive constraints on the luminosity functions of neutrino sources for a range of assumed evolution models.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.2455N,[]
Close encounters of stars with stellar-mass black hole binaries,"Many astrophysical environments, from star clusters and globular clusters to the discs of active galactic nuclei, are characterized by frequent interactions between stars and the compact objects that they leave behind. Here, using a suite of 3D hydrodynamics simulations, we explore the outcome of close interactions between $1\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$ stars and binary black holes (BBHs) in the gravitational wave regime, resulting in a tidal disruption event (TDE) or a pure scattering, focusing on the accretion rates, the back reaction on the BH binary orbital parameters, and the increase in the binary BH effective spin. We find that TDEs can make a significant impact on the binary orbit, which is often different from that of a pure scattering. Binaries experiencing a prograde (retrograde) TDE tend to be widened (hardened) by up to $\simeq 20{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$. Initially circular binaries become more eccentric by $\lesssim 10{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ by a prograde or retrograde TDE, whereas the eccentricity of initially eccentric binaries increases (decreases) by a retrograde (prograde) TDE by $\lesssim 5{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$. Overall, a single TDE can generally result in changes of the gravitational-wave-driven merger time-scale by order unity. The accretion rates of both black holes are very highly super-Eddington, showing modulations (preferentially for retrograde TDEs) on a time-scale of the orbital period, which can be a characteristic feature of BBH-driven TDEs. Prograde TDEs result in the effective spin parameter χ to vary by ≲0.02, while χ ≳ -0.005 for retrograde TDEs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.2204R,[]
A search for hot subdwarf binaries in data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite,"We present the results of a search for binary hot subdwarf stars in photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The sample of objects used in this work was a byproduct of another search for pulsating hot subdwarfs, which resulted in the discovery of nearly 400 non-pulsating variable candidates. The periodogram for each object was calculated and a frequency signal with one or more harmonics above the 4 σ detection threshold was used to consider the candidate as a possible binary system. The type of variability was subsequently confirmed by visual inspection. We present a list of 46 binary system candidates that were not previously known as binaries. We also analysed a few example light curves to demonstrate the importance of double checking the variability of the source in the TESS light curves corrected for instrumental signatures. Four objects, TIC 55753808, TIC 118412596, TIC 4999380, and TIC 68834079, which show variations in the TESS-calibrated fluxes, were actually found to be constant. We also found that it might be more appropriate to increase the commonly used 4σ detection threshold in order to avoid the detection of multiple spurious peaks in the periodograms or Fourier transform of the TESS light curves.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.1509K,[]
Emergence of a new H I 21-cm absorption component at z   1.1726 towards the γ-ray blazar PKS 2355-106,"We report the emergence of a new H I 21-cm absorption at z<SUB>abs</SUB> = 1.172 635 in the damped Lyα absorber (DLA) towards the γ-ray blazar PKS 2355-106 (z<SUB>em</SUB>~1.639) using science verification observations (2020 June) from the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS). Since 2006, this DLA is known to show a narrow H I 21-cm absorption at z<SUB>abs</SUB> = 1.173019 coinciding with a distinct metal absorption-line component. We do not detect significant H I 21-cm optical depth variations from this known H I component. A high-resolution optical spectrum (2010 August) shows a distinct Mg I absorption at the redshift of the new H I 21-cm absorber. However, this component is not evident in the profiles of singly ionized species. We measure the metallicity ([Zn/H] = -(0.77 ± 0.11) and [Si/H]= -(0.96 ± 0.11)) and depletion ([Fe/Zn] = -(0.63 ± 0.16)) for the full system. Using the apparent column density profiles of Si II, Fe II, and Mg I, we show that the depletion and the N(Mg I)/N(Si II) column density ratio systematically vary across the velocity range. The region with high depletion tends to have a slightly larger N(Mg I)/N(Si II) ratio. The two H I 21-cm absorbers belong to this velocity range. The emergence of z<SUB>abs</SUB> = 1.172 635 can be understood if there is a large optical depth gradient over a length-scale of ~0.35 pc. However, the gas producing the z<SUB>abs</SUB> = 1.173 019 component must be nearly uniform over the same scale. Systematic uncertainties introduced by the absorption-line variability has to be accounted for in experiments measuring the variations of fundamental constants and cosmic acceleration even when the radio emission is apparently compact as in PKS 2355-106.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.1339S,[]
The Zwicky Transient Facility phase I sample of hydrogen-rich superluminous supernovae without strong narrow emission lines,"We present a sample of 14 hydrogen-rich superluminous supernovae (SLSNe II) from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) between 2018 and 2020. We include all classified SLSNe with peaks M<SUB>g</SUB> < -20 mag with observed broad but not narrow Balmer emission, corresponding to roughly 20 per cent of all hydrogen-rich SLSNe in ZTF phase I. We examine the light curves and spectra of SLSNe II and attempt to constrain their power source using light-curve models. The brightest events are photometrically and spectroscopically similar to the prototypical SN 2008es, while others are found spectroscopically more reminiscent of non-superluminous SNe II, especially SNe II-L. <SUP>56</SUP>Ni decay as the primary power source is ruled out. Light-curve models generally cannot distinguish between circumstellar interaction (CSI) and a magnetar central engine, but an excess of ultraviolet (UV) emission signifying CSI is seen in most of the SNe with UV data, at a wide range of photometric properties. Simultaneously, the broad H α profiles of the brightest SLSNe II can be explained through electron scattering in a symmetric circumstellar medium (CSM). In other SLSNe II without narrow lines, the CSM may be confined and wholly overrun by the ejecta. CSI, possibly involving mass lost in recent eruptions, is implied to be the dominant power source in most SLSNe II, and the diversity in properties is likely the result of different mass loss histories. Based on their radiated energy, an additional power source may be required for the brightest SLSNe II, however - possibly a central engine combined with CSI.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.1193K,[]
Four new deeply eclipsing white dwarfs in Zwicky Transient Facility,"We present the results of a search for deeply eclipsing white dwarfs in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 4 (DR4). We identify nine deeply eclipsing white dwarf candidates, four of which we followed up with high-cadence photometry and spectroscopy. Three of these systems show total eclipses in the ZTF data and our follow-up Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope observations. Even though the eclipse duration is consistent with sub-stellar companions, our analysis shows that all four systems contain a white dwarf with low-mass stellar companions of ~0.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We provide mass and radius constraints for both stars in each system based on our photometric and spectroscopic fitting. Finally, we present a list of 41 additional eclipsing WD+M candidates identified in a preliminary search of ZTF DR7, including 12 previously studied systems. We identify two new candidate short-period, eclipsing, white dwarf-brown dwarf binaries within our sample of 41 WD+M candidates based on Pan-STARRS colours.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516..720K,[]
The fall of CSS100217: a tidal disruption-induced low state in an apparently hostless active galactic nucleus,"CSS100217 was a nuclear, rapid, and luminous flare in a narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy, whose initial interpretation as a supernova is now debated between variability of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) and a tidal disruption event (TDE). In this paper, we present and discuss new evidence in favour of a TDE or extreme flaring episode scenario. After the decay of the flare, the galaxy entered a long-term low luminosity state, 0.4 mag lower than the pre-outburst emission in the V band. We attribute this to the creation of a cavity in the accretion disc after the tidal disruption of a star in a retrograde orbit with respect to the accretion disc rotation, making a TDE our favoured interpretation of the flare. We also show how the host galaxy shows a point-like, compact profile, no evidence for an extended component and a relatively low mass, unlike what expected from an AGN host galaxy at z = 0.147. A compact host galaxy may result in an increased TDE rate, strengthening our interpretation of the event.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516..529C,[]
GRANDMA observations of ZTF/Fink transients during summer 2021,"We present our follow-up observations with GRANDMA of transient sources revealed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Over a period of six months, all ZTF alerts were examined in real time by a dedicated science module implemented in the Fink broker, which will be used in filtering of transients discovered by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. In this article, we present three selection methods to identify kilonova candidates. Out of more than 35 million alerts, a hundred sources have passed our selection criteria. Six were then followed-up by GRANDMA (by both professional and amateur astronomers). The majority were finally classified either as asteroids or as supernovae events. We mobilized 37 telescopes, bringing together a large sample of images, taken under various conditions and quality. To complement the orphan kilonova candidates, we included three additional supernovae alerts to conduct further observations during summer 2021. We demonstrate the importance of the amateur astronomer community that contributed images for scientific analyses of new sources discovered in a magnitude range r' = 17 - 19 mag. We based our rapid kilonova classification on the decay rate of the optical source that should exceed 0.3 mag d<SUP>-1</SUP>. GRANDMA's follow-up determined the fading rate within 1.5 ± 1.2 d post-discovery, without waiting for further observations from ZTF. No confirmed kilonovae were discovered during our observing campaign.

Photometric variability in star-forming galaxies as evidence for low-mass AGN and a precursor to quenching,"We measure the optical variability in ~16 500 low-redshift (z ~ 0.1) galaxies to map the relations between active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and galaxy stellar mass, specific star formation rate, half-light radius, and bulge-to-total ratio. To do this, we use a reduced χ<SUP>2</SUP> variability measure on >10 epoch light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility and combine with spectroscopic data and derive galaxy parameters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that below the stellar mass of 10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, galaxies classed as star-forming via the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram have higher mean variabilities than AGN or composite galaxies. Revealingly, the highest mean variabilities occur in star-forming galaxies in a narrow range of specific star formation rate: -11 < log(sSFR/yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) < -10. In very actively star-forming galaxies [log(sSFR/yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) > -10], the reduced variability implies a lack of instantaneous correlation with star formation rate. Our results may indicate that a high level of variability, and thus black hole growth, acts as a precursor for reduced star formation, bulge growth, and revealed AGN-like emission lines. These results add to the mounting evidence that optical variability can act as a viable tracer for low-mass AGNs and that such AGNs can strongly affect their host galaxy.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.5905C,[]
The moving mirror model for fast radio bursts,"Recent observations of coherent radiation from the Crab pulsar suggest the emission is driven by an ultrarelativistic (γ ~ 10<SUP>4</SUP>), cold plasma flow. A relativistically expanding plasma shell can compress the ambient magnetic field, like a moving mirror, and thus produce coherent radiation whose wavelength is shorter than that of the ambient medium by γ<SUP>2</SUP>. This mechanism has been previously studied in the context of radio loud supernova explosions. In this work, we propose that a similar mechanism drives the coherent emission in fast radio bursts. The high Lorenz factors dramatically lower the implied energy and magnetic field requirements, allowing the spin-down energy of regular (or even recycled), fast spinning pulsars, rather than slow spinning magnetars, to explain FRBs. We show that this model can explain the frequency and the time evolution of observed FRBs, as well as their duration, energetics, and absence of panchromatic counterparts. We also predict that the peak frequency of subpulses decline with observation time as $\omega _{\rm obs} \propto t_{\rm obs}^{-1/2}$. Unfortunately, with current capabilities it is not possible to constrain the shape of the curve ω<SUB>obs</SUB>(t<SUB>obs</SUB>). Finally, we find that a variation of this model can explain weaker radio transients, such as the one observed from a galactic magnetar. In this variant, the shock wave produces low-frequency photons that are then Compton scattered to the GHz range.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.5682Y,[]
Systematic light-curve modelling of TDEs: statistical differences between the spectroscopic classes,"With the sample of observed tidal disruption events (TDEs) now reaching several tens, distinct spectroscopic classes have emerged: TDEs with only hydrogen lines (TDE-H), only helium lines (TDE-He), or hydrogen in combination with He II and often N III/O III (TDE-H + He). Here, we model the light curves of 32 optically bright TDEs using the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients (MOSFIT) to estimate physical and orbital properties, and look for statistical differences between the spectroscopic classes. For all types, we find a shallow distribution of star masses, compared to a typical initial mass function, in the range ~0.1-1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and no TDEs with very deep encounters. Our main result is that TDE-H events appear to come from less complete disruptions (and possibly lower SMBH masses) than TDE-H+He, with TDE-He events fully disrupted. We also find that TDE-H events have more extended photospheres, in agreement with recent literature, and argue that this could be a consequence of differences in the self-intersection radii of the debris streams. Finally, we identify an approximately linear correlation between black hole mass and radiative efficiency. We suggest that TDE-H may be powered by collision-induced outflows at relatively large radii, while TDE-H + He could result from prompt accretion discs, formed more efficiently in closer encounters around more massive SMBHs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.5604N,[]
An X-ray view of the ambiguous nuclear transient AT2019pev,"AT2019pev is a nuclear transient in a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy at z = 0.096. The archival ultraviolet, optical, and infrared data showed features of both tidal disruption events and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and its nature is not fully understood. We present detailed X-ray observations of AT2019pev taken with Swift, Chandra, and NICER over 173 d of its evolution since the first Swift XRT epoch. The X-ray luminosity increases by a factor of 5 in 5 d from the first Swift XRT epoch to the light-curve peak. The light curve decays by a factor of 10 over ~75 d and then flattens with a weak re-brightening trend at late times. The X-ray spectra show a 'harder-when-brighter' trend before peak and a 'harder-when-fainter' trend after peak, which may indicate a transition of accretion states. The archival ground-based optical observations show similar time evolution as the X-ray light curves. Beyond the seasonal limit of the ground-based observations, the Gaia light curve is rising towards an equally bright or brighter peak 223 d after the optical discovery. Combining our X-ray analysis and archival multiwavelength data, AT2019pev more closely resembles an AGN transient.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.5198Y,[]
All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory eXplorer mission concept,"The All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory eXplorer (AMEGO-X) is designed to identify and characterize gamma rays from extreme explosions and accelerators.

The LSST Era of Supermassive Black Hole Accretion Disk Reverberation Mapping,"The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will detect an unprecedentedly large sample of actively accreting supermassive black holes with typical accretion disk (AD) sizes of a few light days. This brings us to face challenges in the reverberation mapping (RM) measurement of AD sizes in active galactic nuclei using interband continuum delays. We examine the effect of LSST cadence strategies on AD RM using our metric AGN_TimeLagMetric. It accounts for redshift, cadence, the magnitude limit, and magnitude corrections for dust extinction. Running our metric on different LSST cadence strategies, we produce an atlas of the performance estimations for LSST photometric RM measurements. We provide an upper limit on the estimated number of quasars for which the AD time lag can be computed within 0 < z < 7 using the features of our metric. We forecast that the total counts of such objects will increase as the mean sampling rate of the survey decreases. The AD time lag measurements are expected for >1000 sources in each deep drilling field (DDF; (10 deg<SUP>2</SUP>)) in any filter, with the redshift distribution of these sources peaking at z ≈ 1. We find the LSST observation strategies with a good cadence (≲5 days) and a long cumulative season (~9 yr), as proposed for LSST DDF, are favored for the AD size measurement. We create synthetic LSST light curves for the most suitable DDF cadences and determine RM time lags to demonstrate the impact of the best cadences based on the proposed metric.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..262...49K,[]
Kilonova and Optical Afterglow from Binary Neutron Star Mergers. I. Luminosity Function and Color Evolution,"In the first work of this series, we adopt a GW170817-like viewing-angle-dependent kilonova model and the standard afterglow model with a light-curve distribution based on the properties of cosmological short gamma-ray burst afterglows to simulate the luminosity functions and color evolution of both kilonovae and optical afterglow emissions from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. We find that ~10% of the nearly-on-axis afterglows are brighter than the associated kilonovae at the peak time. These kilonovae would be significantly polluted by the associated afterglow emission. Only at large viewing angles with $\sin {\theta }_{{\rm{v}}}rsim 0.20$ , the electromagnetic signals of most BNS mergers would be kilonova-dominated and some off-axis afterglows may emerge at ~5-10 days after the mergers. At a brightness dimmer than ~23-24 mag, according to their luminosity functions, the number of afterglows is much larger than that of kilonovae. Because the search depth of the present survey projects is <22 mag, the number of afterglow events that are detected via serendipitous observations would be much higher than that of kilonova events, consistent with the current observations. For the foreseeable survey projects (e.g., Mephisto, WFST, and LSST), whose search depths can reach ≳23-24 mag, the detection rate of kilonovae could have the same order of magnitude as afterglows. We also find that it may be difficult to use the fading rate in a single band to directly identify kilonovae and afterglows among various fast-evolving transients by serendipitous surveys. However, the color evolution between the optical and infrared bands can identify them because the color evolution patterns of these phenomena are unique compared with those of other fast-evolving transients.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938..147Z,[]
The Pantheon+ Analysis: The Full Data Set and Light-curve Release,"Here we present 1701 light curves of 1550 unique, spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) that will be used to infer cosmological parameters as part of the Pantheon+ SN analysis and the Supernovae and H <SUB>0</SUB> for the Equation of State of dark energy distance-ladder analysis.

"The Pantheon+ Analysis: SuperCal-fragilistic Cross Calibration, Retrained SALT2 Light-curve Model, and Calibration Systematic Uncertainty","We present a recalibration of the photometric systems in the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) including those in the SH0ES distance-ladder measurement of H <SUB>0</SUB>. We utilize the large and uniform sky coverage of the public Pan-STARRS stellar photometry catalog to cross calibrate against tertiary standards released by individual SN Ia surveys. The most significant updates over the ""SuperCal"" cross calibration used for the previous Pantheon and SH0ES analyses are: (1) expansion of the number of photometric systems (now 25) and filters (now 105), (2) solving for all filter offsets in all systems simultaneously to produce a calibration uncertainty covariance matrix for cosmological-model constraints, and (3) accounting for the change in the fundamental flux calibration of the Hubble Space Telescope CALSPEC standards from previous versions on the order of 1.5% over a Δλ of 4000 Å. We retrain the SALT2 model and find that our new model coupled with the new calibration of the light curves themselves causes a net distance modulus change (d μ/dz) of 0.04 mag over the redshift range 0 < z < 1. We introduce a new formalism to determine the systematic impact on cosmological inference by propagating the covariance in the fitted calibration offsets through retraining simultaneously with light-curve fitting and find a total calibration uncertainty impact of σ <SUB> w </SUB> = 0.013; roughly half the size of the sample statistical uncertainty.

The Pantheon+ Analysis: Cosmological Constraints,"We present constraints on cosmological parameters from the Pantheon+ analysis of 1701 light curves of 1550 distinct Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) ranging in redshift from z = 0.001 to 2.26. This work features an increased sample size from the addition of multiple cross-calibrated photometric systems of SNe covering an increased redshift span, and improved treatments of systematic uncertainties in comparison to the original Pantheon analysis, which together result in a factor of 2 improvement in cosmological constraining power.

Our search yielded seven optical transients that resemble on-axis LGRB afterglows in terms of their red colors (g - r > 0 mag), faint host galaxies (r > 23 mag), rapid fading (dr/dt > 1 mag day<SUP>-1</SUP>), and in some cases X-ray and radio emission. Spectroscopy of the transient emission within a few days of discovery established cosmological distances (redshift z = 0.876 to 2.9) for six of the seven events, tripling the number of afterglows with redshift measurements discovered by optical surveys without a γ-ray trigger. A likely associated LGRB (GRB 200524A, GRB 210204A, GRB 210212B, and GRB 210610B) was identified for four events (ZTF 20abbiixp/AT 2020kym, ZTF 21aagwbjr/AT 2021buv, ZTF 21aakruew/AT 2021cwd, and ZTF 21abfmpwn/AT 2021qbd) post facto, while three (ZTF 20aajnksq/AT 2020blt, ZTF 21aaeyldq/AT 2021any, and ZTF 21aayokph/AT 2021lfa) had no detected LGRB counterpart. The simplest explanation for the three ""orphan"" events is that they were regular LGRBs missed by high-energy satellites owing to detector sensitivity and duty cycle, although it is possible that they were intrinsically subluminous in γ-rays or viewed slightly off-axis. We rule out a scenario in which dirty fireballs have a similar energy per solid angle to LGRBs and are an order of magnitude more common. In addition, we set the first direct constraint on the ratio of the opening angles of the material producing γ-rays and the material producing early optical afterglow emission, finding that they must be comparable.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...85H,[]
Radio Analysis of SN2004C Reveals an Unusual CSM Density Profile as a Harbinger of Core Collapse,"We present extensive multifrequency Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of the radio-bright supernova (SN) IIb SN 2004C that span ~40-2793 days post-explosion. We interpret the temporal evolution of the radio spectral energy distribution in the context of synchrotron self-absorbed emission from the explosion's forward shock as it expands in the circumstellar medium (CSM) previously sculpted by the mass-loss history of the stellar progenitor. VLBA observations and modeling of the VLA data point to a blastwave with average velocity ~0.06 c that carries an energy of ≈10<SUP>49</SUP> erg. Our modeling further reveals a flat CSM density profile ρ <SUB>CSM</SUB> ∝ R <SUP>-0.03±0.22</SUP> up to a break radius R <SUB>br</SUB> ≈ (1.96 ± 0.10) × 10<SUP>16</SUP> cm, with a steep density gradient following ρ <SUB>CSM</SUB> ∝ R <SUP>-2.3±0.5</SUP> at larger radii. We infer that the flat part of the density profile corresponds to a CSM shell with mass ~0.021 M <SUB>☉</SUB>, and that the progenitor's effective mass-loss rate varied with time over the range (50-500) × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> M <SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for an adopted wind velocity v <SUB> w </SUB> = 1000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and shock microphysical parameters ϵ <SUB> e </SUB> = 0.1, ϵ <SUB> B </SUB> = 0.01. These results add to the mounting observational evidence for departures from the traditional single-wind mass-loss scenarios in evolved, massive stars in the centuries leading up to core collapse. Potentially viable scenarios include mass loss powered by gravity waves and/or interaction with a binary companion.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...84D,[]
Binaries with Possible Compact Components Discovered from the LAMOST Time-domain Survey of Four K2 Plates,"Time-domain spectroscopic data from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) can provide accurate and high-cadence radial velocities (RVs). In this work, we search for binaries with compact components with the RV monitoring method by using the LAMOST time-domain survey of four K2 plates. Three binary systems including an unseen white dwarf or neutron star are found. For each binary system, we estimate the stellar parameters of the visible star and orbital parameters, and finally calculate the binary mass function and the minimum mass of the unseen star. No obvious double-lined feature is seen from the LAMOST medium-resolution spectra of the three sources. In addition, we found no X-ray counterpart for all these sources but UV companions for two of them. Spectral disentangling also shows no additional component with optical absorption spectra, supporting that these systems contain compact objects.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...78L,[]
The Diverse Properties of Type Icn Supernovae Point to Multiple Progenitor Channels,"We present a sample of Type Icn supernovae (SNe Icn), a newly discovered class of transients characterized by their interaction with H- and He-poor circumstellar material (CSM). This sample is the largest collection of SNe Icn to date and includes observations of two published objects (SN 2019hgp and SN 2021csp) and two objects not yet published in the literature (SN 2019jc and SN 2021ckj). The SNe Icn display a range of peak luminosities, rise times, and decline rates, as well as diverse late-time spectral features. To investigate their explosion and progenitor properties, we fit their bolometric light curves to a semianalytical model consisting of luminosity inputs from circumstellar interaction and radioactive decay of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni. We infer low ejecta masses (≲2 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) and <SUP>56</SUP>Ni masses (≲0.04 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) from the light curves, suggesting that normal stripped-envelope supernova (SESN) explosions within a dense CSM cannot be the underlying mechanism powering SNe Icn. Additionally, we find that an estimate of the star formation rate density at the location of SN 2019jc lies at the lower end of a distribution of SESNe, in conflict with a massive star progenitor of this object. Based on its estimated ejecta mass, <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass, and explosion site properties, we suggest a low-mass, ultra-stripped star as the progenitor of SN 2019jc. For other SNe Icn, we suggest that a Wolf-Rayet star progenitor may better explain their observed properties. This study demonstrates that multiple progenitor channels may produce SNe Icn and other interaction-powered transients.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...73P,[]
Probe for Type Ia Supernova Progenitor in Decihertz Gravitational Wave Astronomy,"It is generally believed that Type Ia supernovae are thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (WDs). However, there is currently no consensus regarding the events leading to the explosion. A binary WD (WD-WD) merger is a possible progenitor of Type Ia supernovae. Space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors with considerable sensitivity in the decihertz range such as the DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) can observe WD-WD mergers directly. Therefore, access to the decihertz band of GWs would enable multi-messenger observations of Type Ia supernovae to determine their progenitors and explosion mechanism. In this paper, we consider the event rate of WD-WD mergers and the minimum detection range to observe one WD-WD merger per year, using a nearby galaxy catalog and the relation between Ia supernovae and their host galaxies. Furthermore, we calculate DECIGO's ability to localize WD-WD mergers and to determine the masses of binary mergers. We estimate that a decihertz GW observatory can detect GWs with amplitudes of h ~ 10<SUP>-20</SUP> [Hz<SUP>-1/2</SUP>] at 0.01-0.1 Hz, which is 1000 times higher than the detection limit of DECIGO. Assuming the progenitors of Ia supernovae are merging WD-WD (1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> and 0.8 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>), DECIGO is expected to detect 6600 WD-WD mergers within z = 0.08, and identify the host galaxies of such WD-WD mergers within z ~ 0.065 using GW detections alone.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...52K,[]
Informing the Cataclysmic Variable Sequence from Gaia Data: The Orbital-period-Color-Absolute-magnitude Relationship,"The orbital-period (P <SUB>orb</SUB>) gap in the population of cataclysmic variables (CVs) informs the theoretical narrative of CV evolution, yet a complete understanding of the driving angular momentum loss mechanisms above and below this gap remains elusive. Here we identify, for standard CVs, a new, apparently monotonic relationship between quiescent color (G <SUB>BP</SUB>-G <SUB>RP</SUB>), absolute magnitude (M <SUB> G </SUB>), and P <SUB>orb</SUB> (between 70 minutes and 8 hr) revealed in Gaia DR2 and EDR3. We show that P <SUB>orb</SUB> increases in the color-absolute-magnitude diagram roughly orthogonally to the white dwarf and main sequences. We find the orbital-period-color-absolute-magnitude relationship to be stable across different CV subtypes: dwarf novae, intermediate polars, polars, and novalike systems. We place our findings in context with the known semiempirical donor sequence for CVs and find a dependence between color and M <SUB> G </SUB> for a given P <SUB>orb</SUB> specifically for dwarf novae and intermediate polars above the period gap. These relations have the potential to inform a more complete picture of CV evolution.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...46A,[]
Transient Radio Emission from Low-redshift Galaxies at z < 0.3 Revealed by the VLASS and FIRST Surveys,"We present the discovery of a sample of 18 low-redshift (z < 0.3) galaxies with transient nuclear radio emission. These galaxies are not detected or are weakly detected in the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey, performed from 1993-2009, but have brightened significantly in radio flux (by a factor of ≳5) in the epoch I (2017-2019) observations of the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). All 18 galaxies have been detected in VLASS epoch II observations, from 2020-2021, from which the radio flux has been found to evolve slowly (with variability amplitudes of ≳40%) over a period of about 3 yr. 15 galaxies have been observed in the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey, and a flat or inverted spectral slope between 888 MHz and 3 GHz is found. Based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra taken before the radio brightening, 14 of the 18 galaxies can be classified as LINERs or normal galaxies with weak or no nuclear activity. Most galaxies are red and massive, with more than half having central black hole masses above 10<SUP>8</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We find that only one galaxy in our sample displays an optical flare lasting for at least two months, with a long decay in the infrared light curve that can be explained as the dust-heated echo emission of a central optical flare, such as a stellar tidal disruption event. We discuss several possibilities for the transient radio emission and conclude that it is likely associated with a newborn radio jet triggered by short sporadic fueling of a supermassive black hole. Such a scenario can be tested with further multifrequency radio observations of these sources, via measuring their radio flux variability and spectral evolution.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...43Z,[]
Variable Star Classification with a Multiple-input Neural Network,"In this experiment, we created a Multiple-Input Neural Network, consisting of convolutional and multilayer neural networks. With this setup the selected highest-performing neural network was able to distinguish variable stars based on the visual characteristics of their light curves, while taking also into account additional numerical information (e.g., period, reddening-free brightness) to differentiate visually similar light curves. The network was trained and tested on Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment-III (OGLE-III) data using all OGLE-III observation fields, phase-folded light curves, and period data. The neural network yielded accuracies of 89%-99% for most of the main classes (Cepheids, δ Scutis, eclipsing binaries, RR Lyrae stars, Type-II Cepheids), only the first-overtone anomalous Cepheids had an accuracy of 45%. To counteract the large confusion between the first-overtone anomalous Cepheids and the RRab stars we added the reddening-free brightness as a new input and only stars from the LMC field were retained to have a fixed distance. With this change we improved the neural network's result for the first-overtone anomalous Cepheids to almost 80%. Overall, the Multiple-input Neural Network method developed by our team is a promising alternative to existing classification methods.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...37S,[]
A Mildly Relativistic Outflow Launched Two Years after Disruption in Tidal Disruption Event AT2018hyz,"We present late-time radio/millimeter (as well as optical/UV and X-ray) detections of tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2018hyz, spanning 970-1300 d after optical discovery. In conjunction with earlier deeper limits, including those at ≈700 days, our observations reveal rapidly rising emission at 0.8-240 GHz, steeper than F <SUB> ν </SUB> ∝ t <SUP>5</SUP> relative to the time of optical discovery. Such a steep rise cannot be explained in any reasonable scenario of an outflow launched at the time of disruption (e.g., off-axis jet, sudden increase in the ambient density), and instead points to a delayed launch. Our multifrequency data allow us to directly determine the radius and energy of the radio-emitting outflow, and we find from our modeling that the outflow was launched ≈750 days after optical discovery. The outflow velocity is mildly relativistic, with β ≈ 0.25 and ≈0.6 for a spherical geometry and a 10° jet geometry, respectively, and the minimum kinetic energy is E <SUB> K </SUB> ≈ 5.8 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> and ≈6.3 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> erg, respectively. This is the first definitive evidence for the production of a delayed mildly relativistic outflow in a TDE; a comparison to the recently published radio light curve of ASASSN-15oi suggests that the final rebrightening observed in that event (at a single frequency and time) may be due to a similar outflow with a comparable velocity and energy. Finally, we note that the energy and velocity of the delayed outflow in AT2018hyz are intermediate between those of past nonrelativistic TDEs (e.g., ASASSN-14li, AT2019dsg) and the relativistic TDE Sw J1644+57. We suggest that such delayed outflows may be common in TDEs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...28C,[]
MEGASIM: Lifetimes and Resonances of Earth Trojan Asteroids-The Death of Primordial ETAs?,"We present an analysis of lifetimes and resonances of Earth Trojan Asteroids (ETAs) in the MEGASIM data set. Trojan asteroids co-orbit the Sun with a planet, but remain bound to the Lagrange points, L4 (60° leading the planet) or L5 (60° trailing). In the circular three-body approximation, the stability of a Trojan asteroid depends on the ratio of the host planet mass and the central mass. For the inner planets, the range of stability becomes increasingly small, so perturbations from the planets have made primordial Trojans rare. To date, there have been just two ETAs (2010 TK<SUB>7</SUB> and 2020 XL<SUB>5</SUB>), several Mars Trojans, and a Venus Trojan discovered. The estimated lifetimes of the known inner system Trojans are shorter than a million years, suggesting they are interlopers rather than members of a stable and long-lasting population. With the largest ETA n-body simulation to date, we are able to track their survival across a wide initialized parameter space. We find that the remaining fraction of ETAs over time is well fit with a stretched exponential function that, when extrapolated beyond our simulation run time, predicts zero ETAs by 2.33 Gyr. We also show correlations between ETA ejections and the periods of the Milankovitch cycles. Though Earth's orbital dynamics dominate the instabilities of ETAs, we provide evidence that ETA ejections are linked to resonances found in the variation of the orbital elements of many if not all of the planets.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938....9Y,[]
Dynamical Unification of Tidal Disruption Events,"The ~100 tidal disruption events (TDEs) observed so far exhibit a wide range of emission properties both at peak and over their lifetimes. Some TDEs radiate predominantly at X-ray energies, while others radiate chiefly at UV and optical wavelengths. While the peak luminosities across TDEs show distinct properties, the evolutionary behavior can also vary between TDEs with similar peak emission properties. In particular, for optical TDEs, while their UV and optical emissions decline somewhat following the fallback pattern, some events can greatly rebrighten in X-rays at late time. In this Letter, we conduct three-dimensional general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of TDE accretion disks at varying accretion rates in the regime of super-Eddington accretion. We make use of Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations to calculate the reprocessed spectra at various inclinations and at different evolutionary stages. We confirm the unified model proposed by Dai et al., which predicts that the observed emission largely depends on the viewing angle of the observer with respect to the disk orientation. Furthermore, we find that disks with higher accretion rates have elevated wind and disk densities, which increases the reprocessing of the high-energy radiation and thus generally augments the optical-to-X-ray flux ratio along a particular viewing angle. This implies that at later times, as the accretion level declines, we expect that more X-rays will leak out along intermediate viewing angles. Such dynamical model for TDEs can provide a natural explanation for the diversity in the emission properties observed in TDEs at peak and along their temporal evolution.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...937L..28T,[]
Identifying High-energy Neutrino Transients by Neutrino Multiplet-triggered Follow-ups,"Transient sources such as supernovae (SNe) and tidal disruption events are candidates of high-energy neutrino sources. However, SNe commonly occur in the universe and a chance coincidence of their detection with a neutrino signal cannot be avoided, which may lead to a challenge of claiming their association with neutrino emission. In order to overcome this difficulty, we propose a search for ~10-100 TeV multiple neutrino events within a timescale of ~30 days coming from the same direction, called neutrino multiplets. We show that demanding multiplet detection by a ~1 km<SUP>3</SUP> neutrino telescope limits the distances of detectable neutrino sources, which enables us to identify source counterparts by multiwavelength observations owing to the substantially reduced rate of the chance coincidence detection of transients. We apply our results by constructing a feasible strategy for optical follow-up observations and demonstrate that wide-field optical telescopes with a ≳4 m dish should be capable of identifying a transient associated with a neutrino multiplet. We also present the resultant sensitivity of multiplet neutrino detection as a function of the released energy of neutrinos and burst rate density. A model of neutrino transient sources with an emission energy greater than a few × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg and a burst rate rarer than a few ×10<SUP>-8</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> is constrained by the null detection of multiplets by a ~1 km<SUP>3</SUP> scale neutrino telescope. This already disfavors the canonical high-luminosity gamma-ray bursts and jetted tidal disruption events as major sources in the TeV-energy neutrino sky.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...937..108Y,[]
A Deep and Wide Twilight Survey for Asteroids Interior to Earth and Venus,"We are conducting a survey using twilight time on the Dark Energy Camera with the Blanco 4 m telescope in Chile to look for objects interior to Earth's and Venus' orbits. To date we have discovered two rare Atira/Apohele asteroids, 2021 LJ4 and 2021 PH27, which have orbits completely interior to Earth's orbit. We also discovered one new Apollo-type Near Earth Object (NEO) that crosses Earth's orbit, 2022 AP7. Two of the discoveries have diameters ≳1 km. 2022 AP7 is likely the largest Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (PHA) discovered in about eight years. To date we have covered 624 square degrees of sky near to and interior to the orbit of Venus. The average images go to 21.3 mag in the r band, with the best images near 22nd mag. Our new discovery 2021 PH27 has the smallest semimajor axis known for an asteroid, 0.4617 au, and the largest general relativistic effects (53 arcsec/century) known for any body in the solar system. The survey has detected ~15% of all known Atira NEOs. We put strong constraints on any stable population of Venus co-orbital resonance objects existing, as well as the Atira and Vatira asteroid classes. These interior asteroid populations are important to complete the census of asteroids near Earth, including some of the most likely Earth impactors that cannot easily be discovered in other surveys. Comparing the actual population of asteroids found interior to Earth and Venus with those predicted to exist by extrapolating from the known population exterior to Earth is important to better understand the origin, composition, and structure of the NEO population.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..168S,[]
Implications for the Collisional Strength of Jupiter Trojans from the Eurybates Family,"In this work, we model the collisional evolution of the Jupiter Trojans and determine under which conditions the Eurybates-Queta system survives. We show that the collisional strength of the Jupiter Trojans and the age of the Eurybates family and by extension Queta are correlated. The collisional grinding of the Jupiter Trojan population over 4.5 Gy results in a size-frequency distribution (SFD) that remains largely unaltered at large sizes (>10 km) but is depleted at small sizes (10 m to 1 km). This results in a turnover in the SFD, the location of which depends on the collisional strength of the material. It is to be expected that the Trojan SFD bends between 1 and 10 km. Based on the SFD of the Eurybates family, we find that the family was likely the result of a catastrophic impact onto a 100 km rubble pile target. This corresponds to objects with a rather low collisional strength (10 times weaker than that of basaltic material studied in Benz & Asphaug). Assuming this weak strength, and an initial cumulative slope of the size-frequency distribution of 2.1 between diameters of 2 m and 100 km when the Trojans were captured, the existence of Queta, the satellite of Eurybates, implies an upper limit for the family age of 3.7 Gy. Alternatively, we demonstrate that an unconventional collisional strength with a minimum at 20 m is a plausible candidate to ensure the survival of Queta over the age of the solar system. Finally, we show how different collisional histories change the expected number of craters on the targets of the Lucy mission and that Lucy will be able to differentiate between them.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..167M,[]
Zwicky Transient Facility and Globular Clusters: Calibration of the gr-band Absolute Magnitudes for the Yellow Post-asymptotic-giant-branch Stars,"We present the first absolute calibration for the yellow post-asymptotic-giant-branch (PAGB) stars in the g and r band based on time-series observations from the Zwicky Transient Facility. These absolute magnitudes were calibrated using four yellow PAGB stars (one nonvarying star and three Type II Cepheids) located in the globular clusters. We provide two calibrations of the gr-band absolute magnitudes for the yellow PAGB stars, by using an arithmetic mean and a linear regression. We demonstrate that the linear regression provides a better fit to the g-band absolute magnitudes for the yellow PAGB stars. These calibrated gr-band absolute magnitudes have a potential to be used as Population II distance indicators in the era of time-domain synoptic sky surveys.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..166N,[]
Double-mode Cepheids from the Zwicky Transient Facility Survey,"Multimode Cepheids pulsate simultaneously in more than one mode of oscillation. They provide an independent means to test stellar models and pulsation theories. They can also be used to derive metallicities. In recent years, the number of known multimode Cepheids has increased dramatically with the discovery of a large number of Galactic double-mode Cepheids. To date, 209 double-mode Cepheids have been detected in the Galactic bulge and disk, mostly based on the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment's (OGLE) catalog. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive search for double-mode Cepheids in the northern sky based on Zwicky Transient Facility Data Release 5. We found 72 such objects in the Milky Way. The periods of the 30 sample objects already included in the OGLE catalog show excellent agreement with the OGLE periods. The period ratios of our new Cepheids are consistent with those of known double-mode Cepheids, as evidenced by their loci in the so-called ""Petersen diagram."" Compared with OGLE, the completeness of our double-mode Cepheid sample is around 71%. The much improved temporal sampling of the Zwicky Transient Facility offers significant scope to find more double-mode Cepheids, especially at the distribution's short-period end.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..162S,[]
Zwicky Transient Facility and Globular Clusters: The Period-Luminosity and Period-Wesenheit Relations for Type II Cepheids,"We present the first gri-band period-luminosity (PL) and period-Wesenheit (PW) relations for 37 Type II Cepheids (TIICs) located in 18 globular clusters based on photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We also updated BVIJHK-band absolute magnitudes for 58 TIICs in 24 globular clusters using the latest homogeneous distances to the globular clusters. The slopes of g/r/i- and B/V/I-band PL relations are found to be statistically consistent when using the same sample of distance and reddening. We employed the calibration of ri-band PL/PW relations in globular clusters to estimate a distance to M31 based on a sample of ~270 TIICs from the PAndromeda project. The distance modulus to M31, obtained using calibrated ri-band PW relation, agrees well with the recent determination based on classical Cepheids. However, distance moduli derived using the calibrated r- and i-band PL relations are systematically smaller by ~0.2 mag, suggesting there are possible additional systematic errors on the PL relations. Finally, we also derive the period-color (PC) relations and for the first time the period-Q-index (PQ) relations, where the Q-index is reddening free, for our sample of TIICs. The PC relations based on (r - i) and near-infrared colors and the PQ relations are found to be relatively independent of the pulsation periods.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..154N,[]
The Rapid Rotation of the Strongly Magnetic Ultramassive White Dwarf EGGR 156,"The distribution of white dwarf rotation periods provides a means for constraining angular momentum evolution during the late stages of stellar evolution, as well as insight into the physics and remnants of double degenerate mergers. Although the rotational distribution of low-mass white dwarfs is relatively well constrained via asteroseismology, that of high-mass white dwarfs, which can arise from either intermediate-mass stellar evolution or white dwarf mergers, is not. Photometric variability in white dwarfs due to rotation of a spotted star is rapidly increasing the sample size of high-mass white dwarfs with measured rotation periods. We present the discovery of 22.4 minute photometric variability in the light curve of EGGR 156, a strongly magnetic, ultramassive white dwarf. We interpret this variability as rapid rotation, and our data suggest that EGGR 156 is the remnant of a double degenerate merger. Finally, we calculate the rate of period change in rapidly-rotating, massive, magnetic WDs due to magnetic dipole radiation. In many cases, including EGGR 156, the period change is not currently detectable over reasonable timescales, indicating that these WDs could be very precise clocks. For the most highly-magnetic, rapidly-rotating massive WDs, such as ZTF J1901+1450 and RE J0317-853, the period change should be detectable and may help constrain the structure and evolution of these exotic white dwarfs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..131W,[]
Impact simulation of Starlink satellites on astronomical observation using worldwide telescope,"Along with the generalization and scale deployment of commercial satellite constellations lead by SpaceX Starlink, light pollution caused by satellites has had a serious impact on astronomical observations. In order to provide a friendly tool for simulating and studying the impact of mega-constellation satellites on astronomical observation, two plugin modules for the WorldWide Telescope were designed. The satellite visibility simulation module ""Sats Tracker"" shows whether and when satellites appear in a specific sky area. The telescope observation module ""Obs Simulator"" loads and simulates observation plans for telescopes. Combining the two modules, we are able to simulate and assess the influence of constellation satellites on a specific observatory at a given time. As an example application of the new tools, we simulated and analyzed the adverse effects of Starlink satellites on observation at the Xinjiang Altay Observatory, including impacts in general for the observatory site and detailed analysis for specific observation plans. In the simulation, the search for electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave events was used as an example of a research topic easily influenced by Starlink and other constellations. The software presented in this paper can be used as an auxiliary tool for observation planning to mitigate the impact of satellite constellations. It also provides an easy-to-use simulation toolkit for the public to understand Starlink and raise their awareness of Dark and Quiet Sky protection.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&C....4100652C,[]
Inferring properties of dust in supernovae with neural networks,"Context. Determining properties of dust that formed in and around supernovae from observations remains challenging. This may be due to either incomplete coverage of data in wavelength or time, but also due to often inconspicuous signatures of dust in the observed data.",,[]
Aims: Here we address this challenge using modern machine learning methods to determine the amount and temperature of dust as well as its composition from a large set of simulated data. We aim to quantify if such methods are suitable to infer quantities and properties of dust from future observations of supernovae.,,,[]
"Methods: We developed a neural network consisting of eight fully connected layers and an output layer with specified activation functions that allowed us to predict the dust mass, temperature, and composition as well as their respective uncertainties for each single supernova of a large set of simulated supernova spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We produced the large set of supernova SEDs for a wide range of different supernovae and dust properties using the advanced, fully three-dimensional radiative transfer code MOCASSIN. We then convolved each SED with the entire suite of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) bandpass filters to synthesise a photometric data set. We split this data set into three subsets which were used to train, validate, and test the neural network. To find out how accurately the neural network can predict the dust mass, temperature, and composition from the simulated data, we considered three different scenarios. First, we adopted a uniform distance of ~0.43 Mpc for all simulated SEDs. Next we uniformly distributed all simulated SEDs within a volume of 0.43-65 Mpc and, finally, we artificially added random noise corresponding to a photometric uncertainty of 0.1 mag. Lastly, we conducted a feature importance analysis via SHapley Additive explanations (SHAP) to find the minimum set of JWST bandpass filters required to predict the selected dust quantities with an accuracy that is comparable to standard methods in the literature.",,,[]
"Results: We find that our neural network performs best for the scenario in which all SEDs are at the same distance and for a minimum subset of seven JWST bandpass filters within a wavelength range 3−25 µm. This results in rather small root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of ~0.08 dex and ~42 K for the most reliable predicted dust masses and temperatures, respectively. For the scenario in which SEDs are distributed out to 65 Mpc and contain synthetic noise, the most reliable predicted dust masses and temperatures achieve an RMSE of ~0.12 dex and ~38 K, respectively. Thus, in all scenarios, both predicted dust quantities have smaller predicted uncertainties compared to those in the literature achieved with common SED fitting methods of actual observations of supernovae. Moreover, our neural network can well distinguish between the different dust species included in our work, reaching a classification accuracy of up to 95% for carbon and 99% for silicate dust.",,,[]
"Conclusions: Although we trained, validated, and tested our neural network entirely on simulated SEDs, our analysis shows that a suite of JWST bandpass filters containing NIRCam F070W, F140M, F356W and F480M as well as MIRI F560W, F770W, F1000W, F1130W, F1500W, and F1800W filters are likely the most important filters needed to derive the quantities and determine the properties of dust that formed in and around supernovae from future observations. We tested this on selected optical to infrared data of SN 1987A at 615 days past explosion and find good agreement with dust masses and temperatures inferred with standard fitting methods in the literature.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...666A.176A,,[]
Asteroid spin-states of a 4 Gyr collisional family,"Context. Families of asteroids generated by the collisional fragmentation of a common parent body have been identified using clustering methods of asteroids in their proper orbital element space. However, there is growing evidence that some of the real families are larger than the corresponding cluster of objects in orbital elements, and there are families that escaped identification by clustering methods. An alternative method has been developed in order to identify collisional families from the correlation between the asteroid fragment sizes and their proper semi-major axis distance from the family centre (V-shape). This method has been shown to be effective in the cases of the very diffuse families that formed billions of years ago.",,[]
"Aims: Here we use multiple techniques for observing asteroids to provide corroborating evidence that one of the groups of asteroids identified as a family from the correlation between size and proper semi-major axis of asteroids are real fragments of a common parent body, and thus form a collisional family.",,,[]
"Methods: We obtained photometric observations of asteroids in order to construct their rotational light curves; we combine them with the literature light curves and sparse-in-time photometry; we input these data in the light curve inversion methods, which allow us to determine a convex approximation to the 3D shape of the asteroids and their orientation in space, from which we extract the latitude (or obliquity) of the spin pole in order to assess whether an object is prograde or retrograde. We included in the analysis spin pole solutions already published in the literature aiming to increase the statistical significance of our results. The ultimate goal is to assess whether we find an excess of retrograde asteroids on the inward side of the V-shape of a 4 Gyr asteroid family identified via the V-shape method. This excess of retrograde rotators is predicted by the theory of asteroid family evolution.",,,[]
"Results: We obtained the latitude of the spin poles for 55 asteroids claimed to belong to a 4 Gyr collisional family of the inner main belt that consists of low-albedo asteroids. After re-evaluating the albedo and spectroscopic information, we found that nine of these asteroids are interlopers in the 4 Gyr family. Of the 46 remaining asteroids, 31 are found to be retrograde and 15 prograde. We also found that these retrograde rotators have a very low probability (1.29%) of being due to random sampling from an underlying uniform distribution of spin poles.",,,[]
"Conclusions: Our results constitute corroborating evidence that the asteroids identified as members of a 4 Gyr collisional family have a common origin, thus strengthening their family membership.",,,[]

Trojan asteroids and the co-orbital dust ring of Venus,"Context. Co-orbital asteroids have been thought to be the possible source of the zodiacal dust ring around the orbit of Venus, but the conclusions about the orbital stability and thus about the existence of Venus Trojans are inconsistent in the literature.",,[]
Aims: We present a systematic survey of the orbital stability of Venus Trojans that takes the dynamical influences from General Relativity and the Yarkovsky effect into account.,,,[]
"Methods: The orbits of thousands of fictitious Venus Trojans were simulated numerically. Using a frequency analysis, we describe their orbital stabilities and the dynamical mechanisms behind them. The influences of General Relativity and of the Yarkovsky effect, which were previously either neglected or oversimplified, were investigated in long-term numerical simulations.",,,[]
"Results: The stability maps on the (a<SUB>0</SUB>, i<SUB>0</SUB>) plane and (a<SUB>0</SUB>, e<SUB>0</SUB>) plane are depicted, and the most stable Venus Trojans are found to occupy low-inclination horseshoe orbits with low eccentricities. The resonances that carve the fine structures in the stability map are determined. General Relativity decreases the stability of orbits only little, but the Yarkovsky effect may drive nearly all Venus Trojans out of the Trojan region in a relatively short time.",,,[]
"Conclusions: The Venus Trojans have a poor orbital stability and cannot survive to the age of the Solar System. The zodiacal dust ring found around the orbit of Venus is more likely a sporadic phenomenon, as the result of a temporary capture into the 1:1 mean motion resonance of dust particles that were probably produced by passing comets or asteroids, but not by Venus Trojans.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...666A..88X,,[]
"SN 2019zrk, a bright SN 2009ip analog with a precursor","We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type IIn supernova SN 2019zrk (also known as ZTF 20aacbyec). The SN shows a > 100 day precursor, with a slow rise, followed by a rapid rise to M ≈ −19.2 in the r and g bands. The post-peak light-curve decline is well fit with an exponential decay with a timescale of ∼39 days, but it shows prominent undulations, with an amplitude of ∼1 mag. Both the light curve and spectra are dominated by an interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM), probably from previous mass ejections. The spectra evolve from a scattering-dominated Type IIn spectrum to a spectrum with strong P-Cygni absorptions. The expansion velocity is high, ∼16 000 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>, even in the last spectra. The last spectrum ∼110 days after the main eruption reveals no evidence for advanced nucleosynthesis. From analysis of the spectra and light curves, we estimate the mass-loss rate to be ∼4 × 10<SUP>−2</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>−1</SUP> for a CSM velocity of 100 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>, and a CSM mass of 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We find strong similarities for both the precursor, general light curve, and spectral evolution with SN 2009ip and similar SNe, although SN 2019zrk displays a brighter peak magnitude. Different scenarios for the nature of the 09ip-class of SNe, based on pulsational pair instability eruptions, wave heating, and mergers, are discussed.",,[]

Hubble constant and nuclear equation of state from kilonova spectro-photometric light curves,"The merger of two compact objects of which at least one is a neutron star is signalled by transient electromagnetic emission in a kilonova (KN). This event is accompanied by gravitational waves and possibly other radiation messengers such as neutrinos or cosmic rays. The electromagnetic emission arises from the radioactive decay of heavy r-process elements synthesized in the material ejected during and after the merger. In this paper we show that the analysis of KNe light curves can provide cosmological distance measurements and constrain the properties of the ejecta. In this respect, MAAT, the new Integral Field Unit in the OSIRIS spectrograph on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC), is well suited for the study of KNe by performing absolute spectro-photometry over the entire 3600 − 10 000 Å spectral range. Here, we study the most representative cases regarding the scientific interest of KNe from binary neutron stars, and we evaluate the observational prospects and performance of MAAT on the GTC to do the following: (a) study the impact of the equation of state on the KN light curve, and determine to what extent bounds on neutron star (NS) radii or compactness deriving from KN peak magnitudes can be identified and (b) measure the Hubble constant, H<SUB>0</SUB>, with precision improved by up to 40%, when both gravitational wave data and photometric-light curves are used. In this context we discuss how the equation of state, the viewing angle, and the distance affect the precision and estimated value of H<SUB>0</SUB>.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...666A..67P,[]
The Hubble constant from two sibling Type Ia supernovae in the nearby galaxy NGC 4414: SN 1974G and SN 2021J,"Having two ""sibling"" Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the same galaxy offers additional advantages in reducing a variety of systematic errors involved in estimating the Hubble constant, H<SUB>0</SUB>. NGC 4414 is a nearby galaxy included in the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project to measure its distance using Cepheid variables. It hosts two sibling SNe Ia: SN 2021J and SN 1974G. This provides the opportunity to improve the precision of the previous estimate of H<SUB>0</SUB>, which was based solely on SN 1974G. Here we present new optical BVRI photometry obtained at the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada and complement it with Swift UVOT UBV data, which cover the first 70 days of emission of SN 2021J. A first look at SN 2021J optical spectra obtained with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) reveals typical SN type Ia features. The main SN luminosity parameters for the two sibling SNe are obtained by using SNooPy, a light curve fitting code based on templates. Using a hierarchical bayesian approach, we build the Hubble diagram with a sample of 96 SNe Ia obtained from the Combined Pantheon Sample in the redshift range z = 0.02 − 0.075, and calibrate the zero point with the two sibling type-Ia SNe in NGC 4414. We report a value of the Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB> = 72.19 ± 2.32 (stat.) ±3.42 (syst.) km s<SUP>−1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>−1</SUP>.

An elliptical accretion disk following the tidal disruption event AT 2020zso,,,[]
"Aims: The modelling of spectroscopic observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) to date suggests that the newly formed accretion disks are mostly quasi-circular. In this work we study the transient event AT 2020zso, hosted by an active galactic nucleus (AGN; as inferred from narrow emission line diagnostics), with the aim of characterising the properties of its newly formed accretion flow.",,,[]
"Methods: We classify AT 2020zso as a TDE based on the blackbody evolution inferred from UV/optical photometric observations and spectral line content and evolution. We identify transient, double-peaked Bowen (N III), He I, He II, and Hα emission lines. We model medium-resolution optical spectroscopy of the He II (after careful de-blending of the N III contribution) and Hα lines during the rise, peak, and early decline of the light curve using relativistic, elliptical accretion disk models.",,,[]
"Results: We find that the spectral evolution before the peak can be explained by optical depth effects consistent with an outflowing, optically thick Eddington envelope. Around the peak, the envelope reaches its maximum extent (approximately 10<SUP>15</SUP> cm, or ∼3000-6000 gravitational radii for an inferred black hole mass of 5−10 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) and becomes optically thin. The Hα and He II emission lines at and after the peak can be reproduced with a highly inclined (i = 85 ± 5 degrees), highly elliptical (e = 0.97 ± 0.01), and relatively compact (R<SUB>in</SUB> = several 100 R<SUB>g</SUB> and R<SUB>out</SUB> = several 1000 R<SUB>g</SUB>) accretion disk.",,,[]
"Conclusions: Overall, the line profiles suggest a highly elliptical geometry for the new accretion flow, consistent with theoretical expectations of newly formed TDE disks. We quantitatively confirm, for the first time, the high inclination nature of a Bowen (and X-ray dim) TDE, consistent with the unification picture of TDEs, where the inclination largely determines the observational appearance. Rapid line profile variations rule out the binary supermassive black hole hypothesis as the origin of the eccentricity; these results thus provide a direct link between a TDE in an AGN and the eccentric accretion disk. We illustrate for the first time how optical spectroscopy can be used to constrain the black hole spin, through (the lack of) disk precession signatures (changes in inferred inclination). We constrain the disk alignment timescale to > 15 days in AT2020zso, which rules out high black hole spin values (a < 0.8) for M<SUB>BH</SUB> ∼ 10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and disk viscosity α ≳ 0.1.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...666A...6W,,[]
Validation and atmospheric exploration of the sub-Neptune TOI-2136b around a nearby M3 dwarf,"Context.

"Velocity and azimuthal anisotropy structures beneath the Dianzhong Block and its vicinity, SE Tibetan Plateau, revealed by eikonal equation-based traveltime tomography","The Dianzhong Block (DZB) located on the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau is an important tectonic zone characterized by the intense flow of crustal material. Although it is widely accepted that materials originating from the Tibetan Plateau migrate southeastward in the DZB and its vicinity, the flow mechanism and subsurface structures remain controversial. Here, we image the subsurface velocity and azimuthal anisotropy structures beneath the DZB and its surroundings by using eikonal equation-based tomography to study the crustal flow and deformation mechanisms. In this study, we collect high-quality seismic data from 290 broadband seismic stations and manually pick a total of 31,981 first arrivals. Our tomographic results display prominent velocity anomalies and complex azimuthal anisotropy patterns. In the upper crust, our results reveal predominant high-velocity anomalies, which are related to the Emeishan large igneous province (ELIP) and the stable Simao Block. We find strong low-velocity anomalies beneath the DZB in the middle-lower crust. The low-velocity anomalies extend southward from the Xiaojinhe Fault (XJHF) to the Red River Fault (RRF) and then rotate southeastward to the east of the Xiaojiang Fault (XJF). In addition, the inverted fast velocity directions generally follow the strike of the low-velocity anomalies. Based on these findings, we consider the existence of middle-lower crustal flow inside the DZB. Three distinct features of azimuthal anisotropy in the middle-upper crust are found around the XJF reflecting complex deformation, which may indicate different factors controlling the deformation of the XJF from the north to the south. In the lower crust and uppermost mantle, the azimuthal anisotropy beneath the RRF is relatively complex, exhibiting two patterns: one perpendicular and another parallel to the fault.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Tectp.83929525L,[]
A Photometric Study of Two Contact Binaries: CRTS J025408.1+265957 and CRTS J012111.1+272933,"We performed new photometric observations for two contact binaries (i.e., CRTS J025408.1+265957 and CRTS J012111.1+272933), which were observed by the 1.0 m telescope at Xingjiang Astronomical Observatory. From our light curves and several survey data, we derived several sets of photometric solutions. We found that CRTS J025408.1+265957 and CRTS J012111.1+272933 were A- and W-type W UMa, respectively. The results imply that the spot migrates or disappears in the two contact binaries, which were identified by chromospheric activity emissions (e.g., H<SUB> α </SUB> emission) from LAMOST spectra. From the O-C curves, the orbital periods of the two contact binaries may be increasing, which is interpreted by the mass transfer from the less massive component to the more massive one. With mass transferring, the two contact binaries may evolve from the contact configurations to semi-detached ones as predicted by the theory of thermal relaxation oscillation.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022RAA....22i5017M,[]
Observing GW190521-like binary black holes and their environment with LISA,"Binaries of relatively massive black holes like GW190521 have been proposed to form in dense gas environments, such as the disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and they might be associated with transient electromagnetic counterparts. The interactions of this putative environment with the binary could leave a significant imprint at the low gravitational wave frequencies observable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We show that LISA will be able to detect up to ten GW190521-like black hole binaries, with sky position errors ≲1 deg<SUP>2</SUP>. Moreover, it will measure directly various effects due to the orbital motion around the supermassive black hole at the center of the AGN, especially the Doppler modulation and the Shapiro time delay. Thanks to a careful treatment of their frequency domain signal, we were able to perform the full parameter estimation of Doppler and Shapiro-modulated binaries as seen by LISA. We find that the Doppler and Shapiro effects will allow for measuring the AGN parameters (radius and inclination of the orbit around the AGN, central black hole mass) with up to percent-level precision. Properly modeling these low-frequency environmental effects is crucial to determine the binary formation history, as well as to avoid biases in the reconstruction of the source parameters and in tests of general relativity with gravitational waves.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PhRvD.106f4056S,[]
"Determining the Hubble constant without the sound horizon: A 3.6 % constraint on H<SUB>0</SUB> from galaxy surveys, CMB lensing, and supernovae","Many theoretical resolutions to the so-called ""Hubble tension"" rely on modifying the sound horizon at recombination, r<SUB>s</SUB>, and thus the acoustic scale used as a standard ruler in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large scale structure (LSS) datasets. As shown in a number of recent works, these observables can also be used to compute r<SUB>s</SUB>-independent constraints on H<SUB>0</SUB> by making use of the horizon scale at matter-radiation equality, k<SUB>eq</SUB>, which has different sensitivity to high redshift physics than r<SUB>s</SUB>. As such, r<SUB>s</SUB>- and k<SUB>eq</SUB>-based measurements of H<SUB>0</SUB> (within a Λ CDM framework) may differ if there is new physics present pre-recombination.

Identifying Transient Candidates in the Dark Energy Survey Using Convolutional Neural Networks,"The ability to discover new transient candidates via image differencing without direct human intervention is an important task in observational astronomy. For these kind of image classification problems, machine learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable success. In this work, we present the results of an automated transient candidate identification on images with CNNs for an extant data set from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova program, whose main focus was on using Type Ia supernovae for cosmology. By performing an architecture search of CNNs, we identify networks that efficiently select non-artifacts (e.g., supernovae, variable stars, AGN, etc.) from artifacts (image defects, mis-subtractions, etc.), achieving the efficiency of previous work performed with random Forests, without the need to expend any effort in feature identification. The CNNs also help us identify a subset of mislabeled images. Performing a relabeling of the images in this subset, the resulting classification with CNNs is significantly better than previous results, lowering the false positive rate by 27% at a fixed missed detection rate of 0.05.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134i4501A,[]
Optical Time-series Photometry of the Symbiotic Nova V1835 Aquilae,"We present time-series CCD photometry in the BVRI passbands of the recently identified symbiotic nova V1835 Aquilae (NSV 11749) over an interval of 5.1 yr with 7-14 day cadence, observed during its quiescence. We find slow light variations with a range of ~0.9 mag in V and ~0.3 mag in I. Analysis of these data show strong periodicity at 419 ± 10 days, which we interpret to be the system's orbital period. A dip in the otherwise-sinusoidal phased light curve suggests a weak ellipsoidal effect due to tidal distortion of the giant star, which in turn opens the possibility that V1835 Aql transfers some of its mass to the hot component via Roche lobe overflow rather than via a stellar wind. We also find evidence that V1835 Aql is an S-type symbiotic star, relatively free of circumstellar dust, and include it among the nuclear burning group of symbiotics. Finally, we provide photometry, periods, and light curve classifications for 22 variable stars in the field around V1835 Aql, about half of which are newly identified.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134i4201C,[]
A dynamically discovered and characterized non-accreting neutron star-M dwarf binary candidate,"Typically, neutron stars are discovered by observations at radio, X-ray or gamma-ray wavelengths. Unlike radio pulsar surveys and X-ray observations, optical time-domain surveys can unveil and characterize exciting but less explored non-accreting and/or non-beaming neutron stars in binaries. Here we report the discovery of such a neutron star candidate using the LAMOST spectroscopic survey. The candidate, designated LAMOST J112306.9 + 400736, is in a single-lined spectroscopic binary containing an optically visible M star. The star's large radial velocity variation and ellipsoidal variations indicate a relatively massive unseen companion. Utilizing follow-up spectroscopy from the Palomar 200 in. telescope and high-precision photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we measure a companion mass of 1.2 4<SUB>−0.03</SUB><SUP>+0.03</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB> . Main-sequence stars with this mass are ruled out, leaving a neutron star or a massive white dwarf. Although a massive white dwarf cannot be excluded, the lack of UV excess radiation from the companion supports the neutron star hypothesis. Deep radio observations with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) yielded no detections of either pulsed or persistent emission. J112306.9 + 400736 is not detected in numerous X-ray and gamma-ray surveys, suggesting that the neutron star candidate is not currently accreting and pulsing. Our work exemplifies the capability of discovering compact objects in non-accreting close binaries by synergizing optical time-domain spectroscopy and high-cadence photometry.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022NatAs...6.1203Y,[]
A Roche lobe-filling hot subdwarf and white dwarf binary: possible detection of an ejected common envelope,"Binaries consisting of a hot subdwarf star and an accreting white dwarf (WD) are sources of gravitational wave radiation at low frequencies and possible progenitors of Type Ia supernovae if the WD mass is large enough. Here, we report the discovery of the third binary known of this kind: It consists of a hot subdwarf O (sdO) star and a WD with an orbital period of 3.495 h and an orbital shrinkage of 0.1 s in 6 yr. The sdO star overfills its Roche lobe and likely transfers mass to the WD via an accretion disc. From spectroscopy, we obtain an effective temperature of $T_{\mathrm{eff}}=54\, 240\pm 1840$ K and a surface gravity of log g = 4.841 ± 0.108 for the sdO star. From the light curve analysis, we obtain an sdO mass of M<SUB>sdO</SUB> = 0.55 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a mass ratio of q = M<SUB>WD</SUB>/M<SUB>sdO</SUB> = 0.738 ± 0.001. Also, we estimate that the disc has a radius of $\sim\!0.41\ \mathrm{R}_\odot$ and a thickness of $\sim\!0.18\ \mathrm{R}_\odot$. The origin of this binary is probably a common envelope ejection channel, where the progenitor of the sdO star is either a red giant branch star or, more likely, an early asymptotic giant branch star; the sdO star will subsequently evolve into a WD and merge with its WD companion, likely resulting in an R Coronae Borealis (R CrB) star. The outstanding feature in the spectrum of this object is strong Ca H&K lines, which are blueshifted by ~200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and likely originate from the recently ejected common envelope, and we estimated that the remnant common envelope (CE) material in the binary system has a density $\sim\!6\times 10^{-10}\ {\rm g\, cm}^{-3}$.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.3370L,[]
Discovery and analysis of three magnetic hot subdwarf stars: evidence for merger-induced magnetic fields,"Magnetic fields can play an important role in stellar evolution. Among white dwarfs, the most common stellar remnant, the fraction of magnetic systems is more than 20 per cent. The origin of magnetic fields in white dwarfs, which show strengths ranging from 40 kG to hundreds of MG, is still a topic of debate. In contrast, only one magnetic hot subdwarf star has been identified out of thousands of known systems. Hot subdwarfs are formed from binary interaction, a process often associated with the generation of magnetic fields, and will evolve to become white dwarfs, which makes the lack of detected magnetic hot subdwarfs a puzzling phenomenon. Here we report the discovery of three new magnetic hot subdwarfs with field strengths in the range 300-500 kG. Like the only previously known system, they are all helium-rich O-type stars (He-sdOs). We analysed multiple archival spectra of the three systems and derived their stellar properties. We find that they all lack radial velocity variability, suggesting formation via a merger channel. However, we derive higher than typical hydrogen abundances for their spectral type, which are in disagreement with current model predictions. Our findings suggest a lower limit to the magnetic fraction of hot subdwarfs of $0.147^{+0.143}_{-0.047}$ per cent, and provide evidence for merger-induced magnetic fields which could explain white dwarfs with field strengths of 50-150 MG, assuming magnetic flux conservation.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.2496P,[]
Photometric and spectroscopic study of the burst-like brightening of two Gaia-alerted young stellar objects,"Young stars show variability on different time-scales from hours to decades, with a range of amplitudes. We studied two young stars, which triggered the Gaia Science Alerts system due to brightenings on a time-scale of a year. Gaia20bwa brightened by about half a magnitude, whereas Gaia20fgx brightened by about two and half magnitudes. We analysed the Gaia light curves, additional photometry, and spectra taken with the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and the Gran Telescopio Canarias. Several emission lines were detected towards Gaia20bwa, including hydrogen lines from H α to H δ, Pa β, Br γ, and lines of Ca II, O I, and Na I. The H α and Br γ lines were detected towards Gaia20fgx in emission in its bright state, with additional CO lines in absorption, and the Pa β line with an inverse P Cygni profile during its fading. Based on the Br γ lines, the accretion rate was $(2.4\!-\!3.1)\times 10^{-8}\, {\rm M}_\odot$ yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for Gaia20bwa and $(4.5\!-\!6.6)\times 10^{-8}\, {\rm M}_\odot$ yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for Gaia20fgx during their bright state. The accretion rate of Gaia20fgx dropped by almost a factor of 10 on a time-scale of half a year. The accretion parameters of both stars were found to be similar to those of classical T Tauri stars, lower than those of young eruptive stars. However, the amplitude and time-scale of these brightenings place these stars to a region of the parameter space, which is rarely populated by young stars. This suggests a new class of young stars, which produce outbursts on a time-scale similar to young eruptive stars, but with smaller amplitudes.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.1774N,[]
Radio emission from simulated tidal disruption events,"Several tidal disruption events such as ASASSN-14li and XMMSL1 J0740-85 have recently been observed in the radio. While the radio emission of some tidal disruption events are attributed to a relativistic jet, a few others are associated with a non-relativistic outflow. This outflow can either be due to a spherical wind or unbound tidal debris. We explore this latter hypothesis in this paper. We show that the maximum velocity of the unbound debris is a function of the impact parameter, such that smaller impact parameters (closer approaches) produce larger maximum velocities. We then model this outflow which expands and shocks the local interstellar medium and compute the peak radio flux and frequency as functions of the impact parameter. Moreover, multiple epochs of observations can put additional constraints on the profile of the local interstellar medium. We apply this analysis to four tidal disruption events whose radio emission is attributed to a non-relativistic outflow and show that the velocities of the unbound material are consistent with our simulated events. We also place constraints on the density profile of three of the four tidal disruption events with multiple epochs of observations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.1699S,[]
Discovering vanishing objects in POSS I red images using the Virtual Observatory,"In this paper, we report a search for vanishing sources in POSS I red images using virtual observatory (VO) archives, tools, and services. The search, conducted in the framework of the VASCO project, aims at finding POSS I (red) sources not present in recent catalogues like Pan-STARRS DR2 (limiting magnitude r = 21.4) or Gaia EDR3 (limiting magnitude G = 21). We found 298 165 sources visible only in POSS I plates, out of which 288 770 had a cross-match within 5 arcsec in other archives (mainly in the infrared), 189 were classified as asteroids, 35 as variable objects, 3592 as artefacts from the comparison to a second digitization (Supercosmos), and 180 as high proper motion objects without information on proper motion in Gaia EDR3. The remaining unidentified transients (5399) as well as the 172 163 sources not detected in the optical but identified in the infrared regime are available from a VO compliant archive and can be of interest in searches for strong M-dwarf flares, high-redshift supernovae, asteroids, or other categories of unidentified red transients. No point sources were detected by both POSS-I and POSS-II before vanishing, setting the rate of failed supernovae in the Milky Way during 70 yr to less than one in one billion.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.1380S,[]
A gap in the double white dwarf separation distribution caused by the common-envelope evolution: astrometric evidence from Gaia,"The trajectory of the center of light of an unresolved binary is different from that of its center of mass. Binary-induced stellar centroid wobbling can therefore be detected as an excess in the goodness-of-fit of the single-star astrometric model. We use reduced χ<SUP>2</SUP> of the astrometric fit in the Gaia Early Data Release 3 to detect the likely unresolved double white dwarfs (DWDs). Using parallax-based distances we convert the excess of reduced χ<SUP>2</SUP> into the amplitude of the centroid wobble δa, which is proportional to the binary separation a. The measured δa distribution drops towards larger wobble amplitudes and shows a break around log<SUB>10</SUB>δa ≈ -0.7 where it steepens. The integral of the distribution yields DWD fraction of 6.5 ± 3.7 per cent in the range $0.01  a\, (\text{au})  2$. Using synthetic models of the Galactic DWDs we demonstrate that the break in the δa distribution corresponds to one side of a deep gap in the DWD separation distribution at around a ≈ 1 au. Model DWDs with separations less than several au shrink dramatically due to (at least one) common envelope phase, reshaping the original separation distribution, clearing a gap and creating a pile-up of systems with a ≈ 0.01 au and log<SUB>10</SUB>δa < -2. Our models reproduce the overall shape of the observed δa distribution and its normalization, however the predicted drop in the numbers of DWDs beyond the break is steeper than in the data.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.1228K,[]
The bulge masses of TDE host galaxies and their scaling with black hole mass,"Tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide a means to probe the low end of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass distribution, as they are only observable below the Hills mass (≲ 10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). Here, we attempt to calibrate the scaling of SMBH mass with host galaxy bulge mass, enabling SMBH masses to be estimated for large TDE samples without the need for follow-up observations or extrapolations of relations based on high-mass samples. We derive host galaxy masses using PROSPECTOR fits to the UV-MIR spectral energy distributions for the hosts of 29 well-observed TDEs with BH mass estimates from MOSFIT. We then conduct detailed bulge/disc decomposition using SDSS and PanSTARRS imaging, and provide a catalogue of bulge masses. We measure a positive correlation between SMBH and bulge mass for the TDE sample, with a power-law slope of 0.28 and significance p = 0.06 (Spearmans) and p = 0.05 (Pearsons), and an intrinsic scatter of 0.2 dex. Applying MC resampling and bootstrapping, we find a more conservative estimate of the slope is 0.18 ± 0.11, dominated by the systematic errors from PROSPECTOR and MOSFIT. This is shallower than the slope at high SMBH mass, which may be due to a bias in the TDE sample towards lower mass BHs that can more easily disrupt low-mass stars outside of the event horizon. When combining the TDE sample with that of the high-mass regime, we find that TDEs are successful in extending the SMBH - stellar mass relationship further down the mass spectrum and provide a relationship across the full range of SMBH masses.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.1146R,[]
Robust features of off-axis gamma-ray burst afterglow light curves,"The ultra-relativistic outflows powering gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) acquire angular structure through their interaction with external material. They are often characterized by a compact, nearly uniform narrow core (with half-opening angle θ<SUB>c,{ϵ, Γ}</SUB>) surrounded by material with energy per unit solid angle ($\epsilon =\epsilon _{\rm c}\Theta _{\epsilon }^{-a}$, where $\Theta _{\lbrace \epsilon ,\Gamma \rbrace }=[1+\theta ^2/\theta _{{\rm c},\lbrace \epsilon ,\Gamma \rbrace }^2]^{1/2}$) and initial specific kinetic energy ($\Gamma _0-1=[\Gamma _{\rm c}-1]\Theta _\Gamma ^{-b}$) declining as power laws. Multiwavelength afterglow light curves of off-axis jets (with viewing angle θ<SUB>obs</SUB> > θ<SUB>c</SUB>) offer robust ways to constrain a, b, and the external density radial profile (ρ ∝ R<SUP>-k</SUP>), even while other burst parameters may remain highly degenerate. We extend our previous work on such afterglows to include more realistic angular structure profiles derived from three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of both long and short GRBs (addressing also jets with shallow angular energy profiles, whose emission exhibits unique evolution). We present afterglow light curves based on our parametrized power-law jet angular profiles for different viewing angles θ<SUB>obs</SUB> and k = {0, 1, 2}. We identify a unique evolutionary power-law phase of the characteristic synchrotron frequencies (ν<SUB>m</SUB> and ν<SUB>c</SUB>) that manifests when the light curve is dominated by emission sensitive to the angular structure of the outflow. We calculate the criterion for obtaining single or double peaked light curves in the general case when θ<SUB>c,Γ</SUB> ≠ θ<SUB>c,ϵ</SUB>. We emphasize how the shape of the light curve and the temporal evolution of ν<SUB>m</SUB> and ν<SUB>c</SUB> can be used to constrain the outflow structure and potentially distinguish between magnetic and hydrodynamic jets.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515..555B,[]
Confronting double-detonation sub-Chandrasekhar models with the low-luminosity suppression of Type Ia supernovae,"Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are likely the thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen (CO) white-dwarf (WD) stars, but their progenitor systems remain elusive. Recently, Sharon & Kushnir used The Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey to construct a synthesized <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass, M<SUB>Ni56</SUB>, distribution of SNe Ia. They found that the rate of low-luminosity ($M_\text{Ni56}\approx 0.15\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) SNe Ia is lower by a factor of ~10 than the more common $M_\text{Ni56}\approx 0.7\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$ events. We here show that in order for the double-detonation model (DDM, in which a propagating thermonuclear detonation wave, TNDW, within a thin helium shell surrounding a sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO core triggers a TNDW within the core) to explain this low-luminosity suppression, the probability of a low-mass ($\approx 0.85\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) WD explosion should be ~100-fold lower than that of a high-mass ($\approx 1.05\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) WD. One possible explanation is that the ignition of low-mass CO cores is somehow suppressed. We use accurate one-dimensional numerical simulations to show that if a TNDW is able to propagate within the helium shell, then the ignition within the CO core is guaranteed (resolved here for the first time in a full-star simulation), even for $0.7\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$ WDs, providing no natural explanation for the low-luminosity suppression. DDM could explain the low-luminosity suppression if the mass distribution of primary WDs in close binaries is dramatically different from the field distribution; if the Helium shell ignition probability is suppressed for low-mass WDs; or if multidimensional perturbations significantly change our results.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515..286G,[]
Spectropolarimetry of the tidal disruption event AT 2019qiz: a quasi-spherical reprocessing layer,"We present optical spectropolarimetry of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT 2019qiz on days +0 and +29 relative to maximum brightness. Continuum polarization, which informs the shape of the electron-scattering surface, was found to be consistent with 0 per cent at peak brightness. On day +29, the continuum polarization rose to ~1 per cent, making this the first reported spectropolarimetric evolution of a TDE. These findings are incompatible with a naked eccentric disc that lacks significant mass outflow. Instead, the spectropolarimetry paints a picture wherein, at maximum brightness, high-frequency emission from the accretion disc is reprocessed into the optical band by a nearly spherical, optically thick, electron-scattering photosphere located far away from the black hole. We estimate the radius of the scattering photosphere to be $\sim 100\rm \, au$ at maximum brightness - significantly larger than the tidal radius ($\sim 1\rm \, au$) and the thermalization radius ($\sim 30\rm \, au$) where the optical continuum is formed. A month later, as the fallback rate drops and the scattering photosphere recedes, the continuum polarization increases, revealing a moderately aspherical interior. We also see evidence for smaller scale density variations in the scattering photosphere, inferred from the scatter of the data in the Stokes q-u plane. On day +29, the H α emission-line peak is depolarized to ~0.3 per cent (compared to ~1 per cent continuum polarization), and displays a gradual rise towards the line's redder wavelengths. This observation indicates the H α line formed near the electron-scattering radius.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515..138P,[]
Multiple giant eruptions and X-ray emission in the recoiling AGN/LBV candidate SDSS1133,"We present a comprehensive analysis of 20 yr worth of multicolour photometric light curves, multiepoch optical spectra, and X-ray data of an off-nuclear variable object SDSS1133 in Mrk 177 at z = 0.0079. The UV-optical light curves reveal that SDSS1133 experienced four outbursts in 2001, 2014, 2019, and 2021. The persistent UV-optical luminosity in the non-outbursting state is ~10<SUP>41</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> with small-scale flux variations, and peak luminosities during the outbursts reach ~10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The optical spectra exhibit enduring broad hydrogen Balmer P-Cygni profiles with the absorption minimum at ~-2000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, indicating the presence of fast-moving ejecta. Chandra detected weak X-ray emission at a 0.3-10-keV luminosity of L<SUB>X</SUB> = 4 × 10<SUP>38</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> after the 2019 outburst. These lines of evidence suggests that SDSS1133 is an extreme luminous blue variable (LBV) star experiencing multiple giant eruptions with interactions of the ejected shell with different shells and/or circumstellar medium (CSM), and disfavours the recoiling active galactic nuclei scenario suggested in the literature. We suggest that pulsational pair-instability may provide a viable explanation for the multiple energetic eruptions in SDSS1133. If the current activity of SDSS1133 is a precursor of a supernova explosion, we may be able to observe a few additional giant eruptions and then the terminal supernova explosion or collapse to a massive black hole in future observations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515..110K,[]
SRGe J214919.3+673634—a Candidate for AM Her Variables Discovered by the eROSITA Telescope onboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma Orbital Observatory,"We present the results of the optical identification, classification, and analysis of our photometric and spectroscopic observations of the X-ray transient SRGe J214919.3+673634 discovered by the eROSITA telescope onboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma orbital observatory in the summer of 2021 during the fourth sky survey. The photometric observations of the optical counterpart of SRGe J214919.3+673634 performed at the 6-m BTA telescope of SAO RAS, the 1.5-m Russian-Turkish telescope RTT-150, and the 2.5-m telescope of CMO SAI MSU as well the archival data from the 48-inch ZTF telescope have shown that the source is a cataclysmic variable with an orbital period $P=85± 0.4$ min and exhibits a long-term photometric variability from $23.5<SUP>m</SUP>$ (low state) to $20<SUP>m</SUP>$ (high state). We show that the light curves in the high state are consistent with the model of an accreting magnetized white dwarf and suggest that SRGe J214919.3+673634 belongs to the AM Her variables. The spectra of the optical counterpart taken in the low state at BTA are consistent with the spectral energy distribution of a white dwarf with a temperature ${∼}24 000$ K.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AstL...48..530B,[]
Monitoring AGNs with Hβ Asymmetry. III. Long-term Reverberation Mapping Results of 15 Palomar-Green Quasars,"In this third paper of the series reporting on the reverberation mapping campaign of active galactic nuclei with asymmetric Hβ emission-line profiles, we present results for 15 Palomar-Green quasars using spectra obtained between the end of 2016-2021 May. This campaign combines long time spans with relatively high cadence. For eight objects, both the time lags obtained from the entire light curves and the measurements from individual observing seasons are provided. Reverberation mapping of nine of our targets has been attempted for the first time, while the results for six others can be compared with previous campaigns. We measure the Hβ time lags over periods of years and estimate their black hole masses. The long duration of the campaign enables us to investigate their broad-line region (BLR) geometry and kinematics for different years by using velocity-resolved lags, which demonstrate signatures of diverse BLR geometry and kinematics. The BLR geometry and kinematics of individual objects are discussed. In this sample, the BLR kinematics of Keplerian/virialized motion and inflow is more common than that of outflow.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..262...14B,[]
A Bayesian Analysis of Physical Parameters for 783 Kepler Close Binaries: Extreme-mass-ratio Systems and a New Mass Ratio versus Period Lower Limit,"Contact binary star systems represent the long-lived penultimate phase of binary evolution. Population statistics of their physical parameters inform an understanding of binary evolutionary pathways and end products. We use light curves and new optical spectroscopy to conduct a pilot study of ten (near) contact systems in the long-period (P > 0.5 days) tail of close binaries in the Kepler field. We use PHOEBE light-curve models to compute Bayesian probabilities on five principal system parameters. Mass ratios and third-light contributions measured from spectra agree well with those inferred from the light curves. Pilot study systems have extreme mass ratios q < 0.32. Most are triples. Analysis of the unbiased sample of 783 0.15 d < P < 2 days (near) contact binaries results in 178 probable contact systems, 114 probable detached systems, and 491 ambiguous systems for which we report best-fitting and 16th-/50th-/84th-percentile parameters. Contact systems are rare at periods P > 0.5 days, as are systems with q > 0.8. There exists an empirical mass ratio lower limit ${q}_{\min }(P)$ ≈ 0.05-0.15 below which contact systems are absent, supporting a new set of theoretical predictions obtained by modeling the evolution of contact systems under the constraints of mass and angular momentum conservation. Premerger systems should lie at long periods and near this mass ratio lower limit, which rises from q = 0.044 for P = 0.74 days to q = 0.15 at P = 2.0 days. These findings support a scenario whereby nuclear evolution of the primary (more massive) star drives mass transfer to the primary, thus moving systems toward extreme q and larger P until the onset of the Darwin instability at ${q}_{\min }$ precipitates a merger.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..262...12K,[]
Cooling Envelope Model for Tidal Disruption Events,"We present a toy model for the thermal optical/UV/X-ray emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs). Motivated by recent hydrodynamical simulations, we assume that the debris streams promptly and rapidly circularize (on the orbital period of the most tightly bound debris), generating a hot quasi-spherical pressure-supported envelope of radius R <SUB>v</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>14</SUP> cm (photosphere radius ~10<SUP>15</SUP> cm) surrounding the supermassive black hole (SMBH). As the envelope cools radiatively, it undergoes Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction R <SUB>v</SUB> ∝ t <SUP>-1</SUP>, its temperature rising T <SUB>eff</SUB> ∝ t <SUP>1/2</SUP> while its total luminosity remains roughly constant; the optical luminosity decays as $\nu {L}_{\nu }\propto \,{R}_{v}^{2}{T}_{\mathrm{eff}}\propto {t}^{-3/2}$ . Despite this similarity to the mass fallback rate ${\dot{M}}_{\mathrm{fb}}\propto {t}^{-5/3}$ , envelope heating from fallback accretion is subdominant compared to the envelope cooling luminosity except near optical peak (where they are comparable). Envelope contraction can be delayed by energy injection from accretion from the inner envelope onto the SMBH in a regulated manner, leading to a late-time flattening of the optical/X-ray light curves, similar to those observed in some TDEs. Eventually, as the envelope contracts to near the circularization radius, the SMBH accretion rate rises to its maximum, in tandem with the decreasing optical luminosity. This cooling-induced (rather than circularization-induced) delay of up to several hundred days may account for the delayed onset of thermal X-rays, late-time radio flares, and high-energy neutrino generation, observed in some TDEs. We compare the model predictions to recent TDE light-curve correlation studies, finding both agreement and points of tension.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...937L..12M,[]
Migratory Outbursting Quasi-Hilda Object 282P/(323137) 2003 BM80,"We report that object 282P/(323137) 2003 BM<SUB>80</SUB> is undergoing a sustained activity outburst, lasting over 15 months thus far. These findings stem in part from our NASA Partner Citizen Science project Active Asteroids (http://activeasteroids.net), which we introduce here. We acquired new observations of 282P via our observing campaign (Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT), Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT), and the Gemini South telescope), confirming 282P was active on UT 2022 June 7, some 15 months after 2021 March images showed activity in the 2021-2022 epoch. We classify 282P as a member of the quasi-Hilda objects (QHOs), a group of dynamically unstable objects found in an orbital region similar to, but distinct in their dynamical characteristics to, the Hilda asteroids (objects in 3:2 resonance with Jupiter). Our dynamical simulations show 282P has undergone at least five close encounters with Jupiter and one with Saturn over the last 180 yr. 282P was most likely a Centaur or Jupiter-family comet (JFC) 250 yr ago. In 350 yr, following some 15 strong Jovian interactions, 282P will most likely migrate to become a JFC or, less likely, an outer main-belt asteroid orbit. These migrations highlight a dynamical pathway connecting Centaurs and JFCs with quasi-Hildas and, potentially, active asteroids. Synthesizing these results with our thermodynamical modeling and new activity observations, we find volatile sublimation is the primary activity mechanism. Observations of a quiescent 282P, which we anticipate will be possible in 2023, will help confirm our hypothesis by measuring a rotation period and ascertaining the spectral type. <SUP>*</SUP> Based on observations obtained at the international Gemini Observatory, a program of NSF's NOIRLab, which is managed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation on behalf of the Gemini Observatory partnership: the National Science Foundation (United States), National Research Council (Canada), Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (Chile), Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (Argentina), Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia, Inovações e Comunicações (Brazil), and Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (Republic of Korea). <SUP>**</SUP> Magellan telescope time was granted by NSF's NOIRLab, through the Telescope System Instrumentation Program (TSIP).

Photometrically Classified Superluminous Supernovae from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey: A Case Study for Science with Machine-learning-based Classification,"With the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), it is expected that only ~0.1% of all transients will be classified spectroscopically. To conduct studies of rare transients, such as Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), we must instead rely on photometric classification. In this vein, here we carry out a pilot study of SLSNe from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1-MDS), classified photometrically with our SuperRAENN and Superphot algorithms. We first construct a subsample of the photometric sample using a list of simple selection metrics designed to minimize contamination and ensure sufficient data quality for modeling. We then fit the multiband light curves with a magnetar spin-down model using the Modular Open-Source Fitter for Transients (MOSFiT). Comparing the magnetar engine and ejecta parameter distributions of the photometric sample to those of the PS1-MDS spectroscopic sample and a larger literature spectroscopic sample, we find that these samples are consistent overall, but that the photometric sample extends to slower spins and lower ejecta masses, which correspond to lower-luminosity events, as expected for photometric selection. While our PS1-MDS photometric sample is still smaller than the overall SLSN spectroscopic sample, our methodology paves the way for an orders-of-magnitude increase in the SLSN sample in the LSST era through photometric selection and study.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...937...13H,[]
"The Tidal Disruption Event AT2021ehb: Evidence of Relativistic Disk Reflection, and Rapid Evolution of the Disk-Corona System","We present X-ray, UV, optical, and radio observations of the nearby (≈78 Mpc) tidal disruption event AT2021ehb/ZTF21aanxhjv during its first 430 days of evolution. AT2021ehb occurs in the nucleus of a galaxy hosting a≈10<SUP>7</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> black hole (M <SUB>BH</SUB> inferred from host galaxy scaling relations). High-cadence Swift and Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) monitoring reveals a delayed X-ray brightening. The spectrum first undergoes a gradual soft → hard transition and then suddenly turns soft again within 3 days at δ t≈272 days during which the X-ray flux drops by a factor of 10. In the joint NICER+NuSTAR observation (δ t = 264 days, harder state), we observe a prominent nonthermal component up to 30 keV and an extremely broad emission line in the iron K band. The bolometric luminosity of AT2021ehb reaches a maximum of ${6.0}_{-3.8}^{+10.4} \% {L}_{\mathrm{Edd}}$ when the X-ray spectrum is the hardest. During the dramatic X-ray evolution, no radio emission is detected, the UV/optical luminosity stays relatively constant, and the optical spectra are featureless. We propose the following interpretations: (i) the soft → hard transition may be caused by the gradual formation of a magnetically dominated corona; (ii) hard X-ray photons escape from the system along solid angles with low scattering optical depth (~a few) whereas the UV/optical emission is likely generated by reprocessing materials with much larger column density-the system is highly aspherical; and (iii) the abrupt X-ray flux drop may be triggered by the thermal-viscous instability in the inner accretion flow, leading to a much thinner disk.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...937....8Y,[]
Radio Nebulae from Hyperaccreting X-Ray Binaries as Common-envelope Precursors and Persistent Counterparts of Fast Radio Bursts,"Roche lobe overflow from a donor star onto a black hole or neutron star binary companion can evolve to a phase of unstable runaway mass transfer, lasting as short as hundreds of orbits (≲10<SUP>2</SUP> yr for a giant donor) and eventually culminating in a common-envelope event. The highly super-Eddington accretion rates achieved during this brief phase ( $\dot{M}rsim {10}^{5}{\dot{M}}_{\mathrm{Edd}})$ are accompanied by intense mass loss in disk winds, analogous to but even more extreme than ultraluminous X-ray (ULX) sources in the nearby universe. Also in analogy with the observed ULX, this expanding outflow will inflate an energetic ""bubble"" of plasma into the circumbinary medium. Embedded within this bubble is a nebula of relativistic electrons heated at the termination shock of the faster v ≳ 0.1c wind/jet from the inner accretion flow. We present a time-dependent, one-zone model for the synchrotron radio emission and other observable properties of such ULX ""hypernebulae."" If ULX jets are sources of repeating fast radio bursts (FRB), as recently proposed, such hypernebulae could generate persistent radio emission and contribute large and time-variable rotation measure to the bursts, consistent with those seen from FRB 20121102 and FRB 20190520B. ULX hypernebulae can be discovered independently of an FRB association in radio surveys, such as VLASS, as off-nuclear point sources whose fluxes can evolve significantly on timescales as short as years, possibly presaging energetic transients from common-envelope mergers.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...937....5S,[]
A Mid-infrared Flare in the Seyfert Galaxy NGC 3786: A Changing-look Event Triggered by an Obscured Tidal Disruption Event?,"We report an exceptional mid-infrared flare in the Seyfert 1.8 NGC 3786. In the multiepoch data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the nuclear mid-infrared brightness of NGC 3786 appears to vary substantially up to 0.5-0.8 mag around mid-2020. However, there is no evidence of significant variation in the corresponding light curve of the optical band from the Zwicky Transient Facility. This implies that the flare may have been heavily obscured by nuclear dust. Through follow-up spectroscopic observations with Gemini-North after the flare, we find that broad emission lines in Paα and Paβ newly appear, while the broad Hβ emission is marginally detected in the postflare spectrum. In addition, their central wavelengths are systematically redshifted up to 900 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> with respect to the narrow emission lines. This reveals that the flare is associated with the changing-look phenomenon from type 1.8 to type 1. Based on these findings, we argue that the flare is likely to originate from an obscured tidal disruption event, although extreme variation in the accretion rate may not be ruled out completely.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...937....3S,[]
Image Subtraction in Fourier Space,"Image subtraction is essential for transient detection in time-domain astronomy. The point-spread function (PSF), photometric scaling, and sky background generally vary with time and across the field of view for imaging data taken with ground-based optical telescopes. Image subtraction algorithms need to match these variations for the detection of flux variability. An algorithm that can be fully parallelized is highly desirable for future time-domain surveys. Here we introduce the saccadic fast Fourier transform (SFFT) algorithm we developed for image differencing. SFFT uses a δ-function basis for kernel decomposition, and the image subtraction is performed in Fourier space. This brings about a remarkable improvement in computational performance of about an order of magnitude compared to other published image subtraction codes. SFFT can accommodate the spatial variations in wide-field imaging data, including PSF, photometric scaling, and sky background. However, the flexibility of the δ-function basis may also make it more prone to overfitting. The algorithm has been tested extensively on real astronomical data taken by a variety of telescopes. Moreover, the SFFT code allows for the spatial variations of the PSF and sky background to be fitted by spline functions.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936..157H,[]
Searching for Cataclysmic Variable Stars in Unidentified X-Ray Sources,"We carry out a photometric search for new cataclysmic variable stars (CVs), with the goal of identification for candidates of AR Scorpii-type binary systems. We select GAIA sources that are likely associated with unidentified X-ray sources, and analyze the light curves taken by the Zwicky Transient Facility, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, and Lulin One-meter Telescope in Taiwan. We investigate eight sources as candidates for CVs, among which six sources are new identifications. Another two sources have been recognized as CVs in previous studies, but no detailed investigations have been done. We identify two eclipsing systems that are associated with an unidentified XMM-Newton or Swift source, and one promising candidate for polar associated with an unidentified ASKA source. Two polar candidates may locate in the so-called period gap of a CV, and the other six candidates have an orbital period shorter than that of the period gap. Although we do not identify a promising candidate for AR Scorpii-type binary systems, our study suggests that CV systems that have X-ray emission and do not show frequent outbursts may have been missed in previous surveys.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936..134T,[]
The Rate and Spatial Distribution of Novae in M31 as Determined by a 20 Year Survey,"A long-term (1995-2016) survey for novae in the nearby Andromeda galaxy (M31) was conducted as part of the Research-Based Science Education initiative. During the course of the survey 180 nights of observation were completed at Kitt Peak, Arizona. A total of 262 novae were either discovered or confirmed, 40 of which have not been previously reported. Of these, 203 novae form a spatially complete sample detected by the KPNO/WIYN 0.9 m telescope within a $20^{\prime} \times 20^{\prime} $ field centered on the nucleus of M31. An additional 50 novae are part of a spatially complete sample detected by the KPNO 4 m telescope within a larger $36^{\prime} \times 36^{\prime} $ field. Consistent with previous studies, it is found that the spatial distribution of novae in both surveys follows the bulge light of M31 somewhat more closely than the overall background light of the galaxy. After correcting for the limiting magnitude and the spatial and temporal coverage of the surveys, a final nova rate in M31 is found to be $R={40}_{-4}^{+5}$ yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is considerably lower than recent estimates. When normalized to the K-band luminosity of M31, this value yields a luminosity-specific nova rate, ν <SUB> K </SUB> = 3.3 ± 0.4 yr ${}^{-1}\,{[{10}^{10}\,{L}_{\odot ,K}]}^{-1}$ . By scaling the M31 nova rate using the relative infrared luminosities of M31 and our Galaxy, a nova rate of ${R}_{{\rm{G}}}={28}_{-4}^{+5}$ yr<SUP>-1</SUP> is found for the Milky Way.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936..117R,[]
Constraints on the Spindown of Fully Convective M Dwarfs Using Wide Field Binaries,"M dwarfs remain active over longer timescales than their Sunlike counterparts, with potentially devastating implications for the atmospheres of their planets. However, the age at which fully convective M dwarfs transition from active and rapidly rotating to quiescent and slowly rotating is poorly understood, as these stars remain rapidly rotating in the oldest clusters that are near enough for a large sample of low-mass M dwarfs to be studied. To constrain the spindown of these low-mass stars, we measure photometric rotation periods for field M dwarfs in wide binary systems, primarily using the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and MEarth. Our analysis includes M-M pairs, which are coeval but of unknown age, as well as M dwarfs with white dwarf or Sunlike primaries, for which we can estimate ages using techniques like white-dwarf cooling curves, gyrochronology, and lithium abundance. We find that the epoch of spindown is strongly dependent on mass. Fully convective M dwarfs initially spin down slowly, with the population of 0.2-0.3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> rapid rotators evolving from P <SUB>rot</SUB> < 2 days at 600 Myr to 2 < P <SUB>rot</SUB> < 10 days at 1-3 Gyr before rapidly spinning down to long rotation periods at older ages. However, we also identify some variability in the spindown of fully convective M dwarfs, with a small number of stars having substantially spun down by 600 Myr. These observations are consistent with models of magnetic morphology-driven spindown, where angular momentum loss is initially inefficient until changes in the magnetic field allow spindown to progress rapidly.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936..109P,[]
Variability-selected Intermediate-mass Black Hole Candidates in Dwarf Galaxies from ZTF and WISE,"While it is difficult to observe the first black hole seeds in the early universe, we can study intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in local dwarf galaxies for clues about their origins. In this paper we present a sample of variability-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) in dwarf galaxies using optical photometry from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and forward-modeled mid-IR photometry of time-resolved Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) co-added images. We found that 44 out of 25,714 dwarf galaxies had optically variable AGN candidates and 148 out of 79,879 dwarf galaxies had mid-IR variable AGN candidates, corresponding to active fractions of 0.17% ± 0.03% and 0.19% ± 0.02%, respectively. We found that spectroscopic approaches to AGN identification would have missed 81% of our ZTF IMBH candidates and 69% of our WISE IMBH candidates. Only nine candidates have been detected previously in radio, X-ray, and variability searches for dwarf galaxy AGN. The ZTF and WISE dwarf galaxy AGN with broad Balmer lines have virial masses of 10<SUP>5</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> < M <SUB>BH</SUB> < 10<SUP>7</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, but for the rest of the sample, BH masses predicted from host galaxy mass range between 10<SUP>5.2</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> < M <SUB>BH</SUB> < 10<SUP>7.25</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. We found that only 5 of 152 previously reported variability-selected AGN candidates from the Palomar Transient Factory in common with our parent sample were variable in ZTF. We also determined a nuclear supernova fraction of 0.05% ± 0.01% yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for dwarf galaxies in ZTF. Our ZTF and WISE IMBH candidates show the promise of variability searches for the discovery of otherwise hidden low-mass AGN.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936..104W,[]
NuSTAR Observations of Intrinsically X-Ray Weak Quasar Candidates: An Obscuration-only Scenario,"We utilize recent NuSTAR observations (co-added depth ≈55-120 ks) of PG 1001+054, PG 1254+047, and PHL 1811 to constrain their hard X-ray (≳5 keV) weakness and spectral shapes and thus to investigate the nature of their extreme X-ray weakness. These quasars showed very weak soft X-ray emission, and they were proposed to be intrinsically X-ray weak, with the X-ray coronae producing weak continuum emission relative to their optical/UV emission. However, the new observations suggest an alternative explanation. The NuSTAR 3-24 keV spectral shapes for PG 1001+054 and PHL 1811 are likely flat (effective power-law photon indices ${{\rm{\Gamma }}}_{\mathrm{eff}}={1.0}_{-0.6}^{+0.5}$ and ${{\rm{\Gamma }}}_{\mathrm{eff}}={1.4}_{-0.7}^{+0.8}$ , respectively), while the shape is nominal for PG 1254+047 (Γ<SUB>eff</SUB> = 1.8 ± 0.3). PG 1001+054 and PHL 1811 are significantly weak at hard X-ray energies (by factors of ≈26-74 at rest-frame 8 keV) compared to the expectations from their optical/UV emission, while PG 1254+047 is only hard X-ray weak by a factor of ≈3. We suggest that X-ray obscuration is present in all three quasars. We propose that, as an alternative to the intrinsic X-ray weakness + X-ray obscuration scenario, the soft and hard X-ray weakness of these quasars can be uniformly explained under an obscuration-only scenario. This model provides adequate descriptions of the multiepoch soft and hard X-ray data of these quasars, with variable column density and leaked fraction of the partial covering absorber. We suggest that the absorber is the clumpy dust-free wind launched from the accretion disk. These quasars probably have super-Eddington accretion rates that drive powerful and high-density winds.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936...95W,[]
Velocity-resolved Reverberation Mapping of Changing-look Active Galactic Nucleus NGC 4151 during Outburst Stage: Evidence for Kinematics Evolution of Broad-line Region,"Changing-look active galactic nucleus NGC 4151, which has attracted a lot of attention, is undergoing the second dramatic outburst stage in its evolutionary history. To investigate the geometry and kinematics of the broad-line region (BLR), and measure the mass of supermassive black hole in NGC 4151, we perform a 7 month photometric and spectroscopic monitoring program in 2020-2021, using the 2.4 m telescope at Lijiang Observatory. We successfully measure the time lags of the responses from broad Hα, Hβ, Hγ, He I, and He II emission lines to continuum variation, which are ${7.63}_{-2.62}^{+1.85}$ , ${6.21}_{-1.13}^{+1.41}$ , ${5.67}_{-1.94}^{+1.65}$ , ${1.59}_{-1.11}^{+0.86}$ , and ${0.46}_{-1.06}^{+1.22}$ days, respectively, following radial stratification. The ratios of time lags among these lines are 1.23: 1.00: 0.91: 0.26: 0.07. We find that the continuum lag between the ultraviolet and optical bands can significantly affect the lag measurements of He I and He II. Virial and infalling gas motions coexist in this campaign, which is different from previous results, implying the evolutionary kinematics of BLR. Based on our measurements and previous ones in the literature, we confirm that the BLR of NGC 4151 is basically virialized. Finally, we compute the black hole mass through multiple lines, and the measurement from Hβ to be ${3.94}_{-0.72}^{+0.90}\times {10}^{7}{M}_{\odot }$ , which is consistent with previous results. The corresponding accretion rate is ${0.02}_{-0.01}^{+0.01}{L}_{\mathrm{Edd}}{c}^{-2}$ , implying a sub-Eddington accretor.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936...75L,[]
"A Multi-epoch, Multiwavelength Study of the Classical FUor V1515 Cyg Approaching Quiescence","Historically, FU Orionis-type stars are low-mass, pre-main-sequence stars. The members of this class experience powerful accretion outbursts and remain in an enhanced accretion state for decades or centuries. V1515 Cyg, a classical FUor, started brightening in the 1940s and reached its peak brightness in the late 1970s. Following a sudden decrease in brightness, it stayed in a minimum state for a few months, then started brightening for several years. We present the results of our ground-based photometric monitoring complemented with optical/near-infrared spectroscopic monitoring. Our light curves show a long-term fading with strong variability on weekly and monthly timescales. The optical spectra show P Cygni profiles and broad blueshifted absorption lines, common properties of FUors. However, V1515 Cyg lacks the P Cygni profile in the Ca II 8498 Å line, a part of the Ca infrared triplet, formed by an outflowing wind, suggesting that the absorbing gas in the wind is optically thin. The newly obtained near-infrared spectrum shows the strengthening of the CO bandhead and the FeH molecular band, indicating that the disk has become cooler since the last spectroscopic observation in 2015. The current luminosity of the accretion disk dropped from the peak value of 138 L <SUB>⊙</SUB> to about 45 L <SUB>⊙</SUB>, suggesting that the long-term fading is also partly caused by the dropping of the accretion rate.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936...64S,[]
Modeling Long-term Variability in Stellar-compact Object Binary Systems for Mass Determinations,"This work models the effects of gravitational lensing, Doppler boosting, and ellipsoidal variations on eccentric eclipsing binary-system light curves. This is accomplished using a Newtonian orbital-motion code that simulates the orbital velocities and separation of the binary components as a function of time. Improving on previous literature, we examine the effects of orbital eccentricity and period, as well as stellar limb darkening on the expected light curves. Whether lensing, Doppler boosting, or ellipsoidal variation is dominant in the light curves is a function of the separation between the binary components; thus, the combination of all three effects allows for a unique mass-determination method that greatly expands the parameter space for the discovery of compact objects. This suggests the exciting possibility of revealing a large population of nonaccreting compact objects in galactic binary systems. At the same time, the model can be used on systems exhibiting any subset of these effects. In a case study, we fit our model to optical data from the ellipsoidal variable binary system Cygnus X-1, and we compare our determinations with those previously found by different modeling techniques.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936...63S,[]
A White Dwarf-Main-sequence Binary Unveiled by Time-domain Observations from LAMOST and TESS,"We report a single-lined white dwarf-main-sequence binary system, LAMOST J172900.17+652952.8, which is discovered by the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST)'s medium-resolution time-domain surveys. The radial-velocity semi-amplitude and orbital period of the optical visible star are measured by using follow-up observations with the Palomar 200 inch telescope and light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Thus the mass function of the invisible candidate white dwarf is derived, f(M <SUB>2</SUB>) = 0.120 ± 0.003 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The mass of the visible star is measured based on a spectral energy distribution fitting, M <SUB>1</SUB> = ${0.81}_{-0.06}^{+0.07}\,{M}_{\odot }$ . Hence, the mass of its invisible companion is M <SUB>2</SUB> ≳ 0.63 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The companion ought to be a compact object rather than a main-sequence star owing to the mass ratio q = M <SUB>2</SUB>/M <SUB>1</SUB> ≳ 0.78 and the single-lined spectra. The compact object is likely to be a white dwarf if the inclination angle is not small, i ≳ 40°. By using the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) near-UV flux, the effective temperature of the white dwarf candidate is constrained as ${T}_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\mathrm{WD}}$ ≲ 12,000-13,500 K. It is difficult to detect white dwarfs which are outshone by their bright companions via single-epoch optical spectroscopic surveys. Therefore, optical time-domain surveys can play an important role in unveiling invisible white dwarfs and other compact objects in binaries.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936...33Z,[]
TIC 452991707 and TIC 452991693 as a Candidate Sextuple System with Three Eclipsing Binaries,"We present the discovery of a rare system detected in the TESS data showing three different eclipsing-like signals. TIC 452991707 and TIC 452991693 seem to be the second such system on the sky, whose two components separated about 16"" are gravitationally bounded, or comprise a co-moving pair. The three periods detected from the TESS data are: P<SUB>A</SUB>=1.46155 d, P<sun>B=1.77418 d, and P<sun>C=1.03989 d, respectively. The A and B periods belong to TIC 452991707, while the C comes from the component TIC 452991693. The pair A shows the deepest eclipses, and its orbit is very slightly eccentric. The third period C has lowest amplitude (eclipsing or ellipsoidal nature), but originates from TIC 452991693, which is connected to A+B because both visual components share similar proper motion and distance. Long-term collection of data from older photometry from various surveys also shows that the two inner pairs A and B orbit around their barycenter. Its period is probably of a few years, but for a final derivation of its orbital parameters one needs more up-to-date data. Hence, we call for new observations of this amazing system.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AcA....72..103Z,[]
High-Energy Extragalactic Neutrino Astrophysics,"The detection of an astrophysical flux of neutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy range by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has opened new possibilities for the study of extreme cosmic accelerators. The apparent isotropy of the neutrino arrival directions favors an extragalactic origin for this flux, potentially created by a large population of distant sources. Recent evidence for the detection of neutrino emission from extragalactic sources includes the active galaxies TXS 0506+056 and NGC 1068. We here review the current status of the search for the sources of the high-energy neutrino flux, concentrating on its extragalactic contribution.

Searching the SETI Ellipsoid with Gaia,"The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) Ellipsoid is a geometric method for prioritizing technosignature observations based on the strategy of receiving signals synchronized to conspicuous astronomical events. Precise distances to nearby stars from Gaia makes constraining Ellipsoid crossing times possible. Here we explore the utility of using the Gaia Catalog of Nearby Stars to select targets on the SN 1987A SETI Ellipsoid, as well as the Ellipsoids defined by 278 classical novae. Less than 8% of stars within the 100 pc sample are inside the SN 1987A SETI Ellipsoid, meaning the vast majority of nearby stars are still viable targets for monitoring over time.

"TESS Hunt for Young and Maturing Exoplanets (THYME). VII. Membership, Rotation, and Lithium in the Young Cluster Group-X and a New Young Exoplanet","The public, all-sky surveys Gaia and TESS provide the ability to identify new young associations and determine their ages. These associations enable study of planetary evolution by providing new opportunities to discover young exoplanets. A young association was recently identified by Tang et al. and Fürnkranz et al. using astrometry from Gaia (called ""Group-X"" by the former). In this work, we investigate the age and membership of this association, and we validate the exoplanet TOI 2048 b, which was identified to transit a young, late G dwarf in Group-X using photometry from TESS. We first identified new candidate members of Group-X using Gaia EDR3 data. To infer the age of the association, we measured rotation periods for candidate members using TESS data. The clear color-period sequence indicates that the association is the same age as the 300 ± 50 Myr old NGC 3532. We obtained optical spectra for candidate members that show lithium absorption consistent with this young age. Further, we serendipitously identify a new, small association nearby Group-X, which we call MELANGE-2. Lastly, we statistically validate TOI 2048 b, which is a 2.1 ± 0.2 R <SUB>⊕</SUB> radius planet on a 13.8-day orbit around its 300 Myr old host star.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..115N,[]

TOI-3757 b: A Low-density Gas Giant Orbiting a Solar-metallicity M Dwarf,"We present the discovery of a new Jovian-sized planet, TOI-3757 b, the lowest-density transiting planet known to orbit an M dwarf (M0V). This planet was discovered around a solar-metallicity M dwarf, using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite photometry and confirmed with precise radial velocities from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) and NEID. With a planetary radius of 12.0 ${}_{-0.5}^{+0.4}$ R <SUB>⊕</SUB> and mass of 85.3 ${}_{-8.7}^{+8.8}$ M <SUB>⊕</SUB>, not only does this object add to the small sample of gas giants (~10) around M dwarfs, but also its low density ( $\rho ={0.27}_{-0.04}^{+0.05}$ g cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) provides an opportunity to test theories of planet formation. We present two hypotheses to explain its low density; first, we posit that the low metallicity of its stellar host (~0.3 dex lower than the median metallicity of M dwarfs hosting gas giants) could have played a role in the delayed formation of a solid core massive enough to initiate runaway accretion. Second, using the eccentricity estimate of 0.14 ± 0.06, we determine it is also plausible for tidal heating to at least partially be responsible for inflating the radius of TOI-3757b b. The low density and large scale height of TOI-3757 b makes it an excellent target for transmission spectroscopy studies of atmospheric escape and composition (transmission spectroscopy measurement of ~ 190). We use HPF to perform transmission spectroscopy of TOI-3757 b using the helium 10830 Å line. Doing this, we place an upper limit of 6.9% (with 90% confidence) on the maximum depth of the absorption from the metastable transition of He at ~10830 Å, which can help constraint the atmospheric mass-loss rate in this energy-limited regime.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164...81K,[]

"Results: We applied this technique to probe the accretion flows near Schwarzschild-like and charged Reissner-Nordström (RN) wormholes; we assumed both a charged RN wormhole and a special case with a vanishing electromagnetic charge, namely the Damour-Solodukhin (DS) wormhole. We show that the photon sphere for the Schwarzschild-like wormhole present for both thin and thick accretion disks, even for the vanishing tidal forces. Moreover, we observe that r<SUB>ph</SUB> → ∞ as α → ∞, which constraints the α parameter to be sufficiently small and positive in order to respect Event Horizon Telescope observations. On the other hand, for the case of the RN wormhole, the photon sphere radius shrinks as Λ → ∞, as predicted by the effective potential. In addition to the accretion disks, we also probe the relativistic jets around the two wormhole solutions under consideration. Finally, with the help of star bulb microlensing, we approximate the radius of the wormhole shadow and find that for the Schwarzschild wormhole, R<SUB>Sh</SUB> ≈ r<SUB>0</SUB> for zero tidal forces and grows linearly with α. On the contrary, the shadow radius for charged wormholes slowly decreases with the growing DS parameter, Λ.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...665A.139S,,[]
Testing the homogeneity of type Ia Supernovae in near-infrared for accurate distance estimations,"Since the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe more than two decades ago, Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) have been extensively used as standardisable candles in the optical. However, SNe Ia have shown to be more homogeneous in the near-infrared (NIR), where the effect of dust extinction is also attenuated. In this work, we explore the possibility of using a low number of NIR observations for accurate distance estimations, given the homogeneity at these wavelengths. We found that one epoch in J and/or H band, plus good gr-band coverage, gives an accurate estimation of peak magnitudes in the J (J<SUB>max</SUB>) and H (H<SUB>max</SUB>) bands. The use of a single NIR epoch only introduces an additional scatter of ∼0.05 mag for epochs around the time of B-band peak magnitude (T<SUB>max</SUB>). We also tested the effect of optical cadence and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the estimation of T<SUB>max</SUB> and its uncertainty propagation to the NIR peak magnitudes. Both cadence and S/N have a similar contribution, where we constrained the introduced scatter of each to < 0.02 mag in J<SUB>max</SUB> and < 0.01 in H<SUB>max</SUB>. However, these effects are expected to be negligible, provided the data quality is comparable to that obtained for observations of nearby SNe (z ≲ 0.1). The effect of S/N in the NIR was tested as well. For SNe Ia at 0.08 < z ≲ 0.1, NIR observations with better S/N than that found in the CSP sample is necessary to constrain the introduced scatter to a minimum (≲0.05 mag). These results provide confidence for our FLOWS project that is aimed at using SNe Ia with public ZTF optical light curves and few NIR epochs to map out the peculiar velocity field of the local Universe. This will allow us to determine the distribution of dark matter in our own supercluster, Laniakea, and to test the standard cosmological model by measuring the growth rate of structures, parameterised by fD, and the Hubble-Lemaître constant, H<SUB>0</SUB>.",,[]

From the planet parameters and the stellar element abundances, we infer the most probable models of planet internal structure and composition, which are consistent with a relatively small metallic core with respect to the Earth, a deep silicate mantle, and a thin volatile upper layer. With all these ingredients, we outline prospects for Gl 486 b atmospheric studies, especially with forthcoming James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) observations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...665A.120C,,[]
SNGuess: A method for the selection of young extragalactic transients,"Context. With a rapidly rising number of transients detected in astronomy, classification methods based on machine learning are increasingly being employed. Their goals are typically to obtain a definitive classification of transients, and for good performance they usually require the presence of a large set of observations. However, well-designed, targeted models can reach their classification goals with fewer computing resources.",,[]
Aims: The aim of this study is to assist in the observational astronomy task of deciding whether a newly detected transient warrants follow-up observations.,,,[]
"Methods: This paper presents SNGuess, a model designed to find young extragalactic nearby transients with high purity. SNGuess works with a set of features that can be efficiently calculated from astronomical alert data. Some of these features are static and associated with the alert metadata, while others must be calculated from the photometric observations contained in the alert. Most of the features are simple enough to be obtained or to be calculated already at the early stages in the lifetime of a transient after its detection. We calculate these features for a set of labeled public alert data obtained over a time span of 15 months from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The core model of SNGuess consists of an ensemble of decision trees, which are trained via gradient boosting.",,,[]
"Results: Approximately 88% of the candidates suggested by SNGuess from a set of alerts from ZTF spanning from April 2020 to August 2021 were found to be true relevant supernovae (SNe). For alerts with bright detections, this number ranges between 92% and 98%. Since April 2020, transients identified by SNGuess as potential young SNe in the ZTF alert stream are being published to the Transient Name Server (TNS) under the AMPEL_ZTF_NEW group identifier. SNGuess scores for any transient observed by ZTF can be accessed via a web service <ext-link ext-link-type=""uri"" xlink:href=""https://ampel.zeuthen.desy.de/api/live/docs"">https://ampel.zeuthen.desy.de/api/live/docs</ext-link>.

"Conclusions: SNGuess is a lightweight, portable, and easily re-trainable model that can effectively suggest transients for follow-up. These properties make it a useful tool for optimizing follow-up observation strategies and for assisting humans in the process of selecting candidate transients.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...665A..99M,,[]
Surface Properties of Near-Sun Asteroids,"Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) with small perihelion distances reach subsolar temperatures of ≥1000 K. They are hypothesized to undergo ""supercatastrophic"" disruption, potentially caused by near-Sun processes such as thermal cracking, spin-up, meteoroid impacts, and subsurface volatile release, all of which are likely to cause surface alteration, which may change the spectral slope of the surface. We attempted to observe 35 of the 53 known near-Sun asteroids with q ≤ 0.15 au from 2017 January to 2020 March to search for trends related to near-Sun processes. We report the optical colors and spectral slopes of 22 objects that we successfully observed and the measured rotation periods for three objects. We find the distribution of colors to be overall bluer than the color distribution of NEAs, though there is a large overlap. We attribute the large scatter to unknown dynamical histories and compositions for individual objects, as well as competing surface altering processes. We also investigated potential correlations between colors and other properties (e.g., perihelion distance, Tisserand parameter, rotation period) and searched for evidence of activity. Finally, we have compiled all known physical and dynamical properties of these objects, including probabilistic source regions and dwell times with q ≤ 0.15 au.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PSJ.....3..187H,[]
Deep-learning real/bogus classification for the Tomo-e Gozen transient survey,"We present a deep neural network real/bogus classifier that improves classification performance in the Tomo-e Gozen Transient survey by handling label errors in the training data. In the wide-field, high-frequency transient survey with Tomo-e Gozen, the performance of conventional convolutional neural network classifiers is not sufficient as about 10<SUP>6</SUP> bogus detections appear every night. In need of a better classifier, we have developed a new two-stage training method. In this training method, label errors in the training data are first detected by normal supervised learning classification, and then they are unlabeled and used for training of semi-supervised learning. For actual observed data, the classifier with this method achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9998 and a false positive rate (FPR) of 0.0002 at a true positive rate (TPR) of 0.9. This training method saves relabeling effort by humans and works better on training data with a high fraction of label errors. By implementing the developed classifier in the Tomo-e Gozen pipeline, the number of transient candidates was reduced to ~40 objects per night, which is ~1/130 of the previous version, while maintaining the recovery rate of real transients. This enables more efficient selection of targets for follow-up observations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASJ...74..946T,[]
Automatic detection of accretion bursts in young stellar objects: A new algorithm for long-term sky surveys,"Young stellar objects in their pre-main sequence phase are characterized by irregular changes in brightness, generally attributed to an increase of the mass accretion rate due to various kind of instabilities occurring in the circumstellar disk. In the era of large surveys aimed to monitor the sky, we present a pipeline to detect irregular bursts, in particular EXors-like (EX Lupi type eruptive variables), in the light curves. The procedure follows a heuristic approach and is tested against the light curves already collected for a few objects presently recognized as bona fide or candidate EXors.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022NewA...9501813S,[]
Supernovae and their cosmological implications,"Supernovae (SNe) are luminous optical transients, which, despite being rare events in a single galaxy, nowadays are discovered at a rate of ten per day. They populate a growing zoo of different types linked to a variety of progenitors and explosion mechanisms. Through a biased selection of a century of researches, I will review how SNe have became a leading tool to probe the cosmic expansion. I will mainly focus on SNe of type Ia, originating from the thermonuclear explosion of white dwarfs, that were demonstrated to be excellent distance indicators after proper calibration and standardisation. Two decades ago, SNe Ia provided the surprising result that the cosmic expansion is accelerated by a misterious dark energy. Recently, with the decisive contribution of Cepheids variables as primary distance indicators, SN Ia allowed to measure the value of the Hubble-Lemaître constant, $$H_0$$ H 0 , with an error of only 1%. It turned out that the value of $$H_0$$ H 0 based on SNe Ia is in tension with the one measured through the fit of the CMB fluctuations. If confirmed, this finding requires a deep revision of the standard cosmological model.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022NCimR..45..549C,[]
CoBiToM Project - II. Evolution of contact binary systems close to the orbital period cut-off,"Ultra-short orbital period contact binaries (P<SUB>orb</SUB> < 0.26 d) host some of the smallest and least massive stars. These systems are faint and rare, and it is believed that they have reached a contact configuration after several Gyrs of evolution via angular momentum loss, mass transfer, and mass loss through stellar wind processes. This study is conducted in the frame of the Contact Binaries Towards Merging (CoBiToM) Project and presents the results from light curve and orbital analysis of 30 ultra-short orbital period contact binaries, with the aim to investigate the possibility of them being red nova progenitors, eventually producing merger events. Approximately half of the systems exhibit orbital period modulations, as a result of mass transfer or mass loss processes. Although they are in contact, their fill-out factor is low (less than 30 per cent), while their mass ratio is larger than the one in longer period contact binaries. This study investigates the orbital stability of these systems and examines their physical and orbital parameters in comparison to those of the entire sample of known and well-studied contact binaries, based on combined spectroscopic and photometric analysis. It is found that ultra-short orbital period contact binaries have very stable orbits, while very often additional components are gravitationally bound in wide orbits around the central binary system. We confirmed that the evolution of such systems is very slow, which explains why the components of ultra-short orbital period systems are still Main Sequence stars after several Gyrs of evolution.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.5528L,[]
Statistics of BY Draconis chromospheric variable stars,"We present an extensive catalogue of BY Draconis (BY Dra)-type variables and their stellar parameters. BY Dra are main-sequence FGKM-type stars. They exhibit inhomogeneous starspots and bright faculae in their photospheres. These features are caused by stellar magnetic fields, which are carried along with the stellar disc through rotation and which produce gradual modulations in their light curves (LCs). Our main objective is to characterize the properties of BY Dra variables over a wide range of stellar masses, temperatures, and rotation periods. A recent study categorized 84 697 BY Dra variables from Data Release 2 of the Zwicky Transient Facility based on their LCs. We have collected additional photometric data from multiple surveys and performed broad-band spectral energy distribution fits to estimate stellar parameters. We found that more than half of our sample objects are of K spectral type, covering an extensive range of stellar parameters in the low-mass regime (0.1-1.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). Compared with previous studies, most of the sources in our catalogue are rapid rotators, and so most of them must be young stars for which a spin-down has not yet occurred. We subdivided our catalogue based on convection zone depth and found that the photospheric activity index, S<SUB>ph</SUB>, is lower for higher effective temperatures, i.e. for thinner convective envelopes. We observe a broad range of photospheric magnetic activity for different spectral classes owing to the presence of stellar populations of different ages. We found a higher magnetically active fraction for K- than M-type stars.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.4932C,[]
TSCat: data model and storage engine for AI-based light-curve analysis,"Light-curve data are one of the most important data sources in time domain astronomy research. With the advancement of observation facilities and the continuous accumulation of observation data, and considering the analysis needs of large sample data sets, software or tools based on new technologies, especially artificial intelligence (AI), will be indispensable for light-curve analysis. The light-curve analysis tool designed by an individual will follow its own defined data structure, which will make the tools designed and developed by different individuals incompatible. A unified light-curve data model will be able to solve this compatibility problem, similar to the traditional flexible image transport system (FITS) file format. This paper proposes a light-curve data model named TSCat, designs and implements a data storage engine. The TSCat data model defines the basic metadata and format required for storing optical curve data following the international virtual observatory alliance (IVOA) data format specification system. The TSCat storage engine implements basic operations such as importing, storing, and accessing light-curve data. The function and performance of the TSCat storage engine are evaluated through the actual observation data. The experimental results show that the TSCat data model is complete enough to support the analysis of light curves. TSCat will help support the standardization of the data access level of software and tools in the field of light-curve analysis, and provide a new reference for the specification system of astronomical scientific data formats.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.4756L,[]
Could TDE outflows produce the PeV neutrino events?,"A tidal disruption event (TDE), AT2019dsg, was observed to be associated with a PeV neutrino event, IceCube-191001A, lagging the optical outburst by a half year. It is known that TDEs may generate ultra fast outflows. If the TDE occurs in a cloudy environment, the outflow-cloud interactions may form shock waves which generate accelerated protons and hence, delayed neutrinos from hadronic interactions in clouds. Here, we investigate the neutrino production in AT2019dsg by examining the TDE outflow-cloud interaction model. We find that, for an outflow with a velocity of 0.07 c and a kinetic luminosity of $10^{45}\rm \,erg\ \,s^{-1}$, protons may be accelerated up to ~60 PeV by the bow shocks, and generate PeV neutrinos by interactions with clouds. The predicted neutrino number in this model depends on the uncertainties of model parameters and in order to match the observations, some challenging values of parameters have been involved. The PeV neutrino event number can be ~4 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> for a hard proton index Γ = 1.5.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.4406W,[]
TESS discovery of a sub-Neptune orbiting a mid-M dwarf TOI-2136,"We present the discovery of TOI-2136 b, a sub-Neptune planet transiting a nearby M4.5V-type star every 7.85 d, identified through photometric measurements from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. The host star is located 33 pc away with a radius of R<SUB>*</SUB> = 0.34 ± 0.02 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>, a mass of $0.34\pm 0.02 \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$, and an effective temperature of 3342 ± 100 K. We estimate its stellar rotation period to be 75 ± 5 d based on archival long-term photometry. We confirm and characterize the planet based on a series of ground-based multiwavelength photometry, high-angular-resolution imaging observations, and precise radial velocities from Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)/SpectroPolarimètre InfraROUge (SPIRou). Our joint analysis reveals that the planet has a radius of 2.20 ± 0.17 R<SUB>⊕</SUB> and a mass of 6.4 ± 2.4 M<SUB>⊕</SUB>. The mass and radius of TOI-2136 b are consistent with a broad range of compositions, from water-ice to gas-dominated worlds. TOI-2136 b falls close to the radius valley for M dwarfs predicted by thermally driven atmospheric mass-loss models, making it an interesting target for future studies of its interior structure and atmospheric properties.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.4120G,[]
Starfall: a heavy rain of stars in 'turning on' AGN,"As active galactic nuclei (AGN) 'turn on', some stars end up embedded in accretion discs around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on retrograde orbits. Such stars experience strong headwinds, aerodynamic drag, ablation, and orbital evolution on short time-scales. The loss of orbital angular momentum in the first ~0.1 Myr of an AGN leads to a heavy rain of stars ('starfall') into the inner disc and on to the SMBH. A large AGN loss cone (θ<SUB>AGN, lc</SUB>) can result from binary scatterings in the inner disc and yield tidal disruption events (TDEs). Signatures of starfall include optical/UV flares that rise in luminosity over time, particularly in the inner disc. If the SMBH mass is $M_{\rm SMBH} rsim 10^{8}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$, flares truncate abruptly and the star is swallowed. If $M_{\rm SMBH} 10^{8}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$, and if the infalling orbit lies within θ<SUB>AGN, lc</SUB>, the flare is followed by a TDE that can be prograde or retrograde relative to the AGN inner disc. Retrograde AGN TDEs are overluminous and short-lived as in-plane ejecta collide with the inner disc and a lower AGN state follows. Prograde AGN TDEs add angular momentum to inner disc gas and so start off looking like regular TDEs but are followed by an AGN high state. Searches for such flare signatures test models of AGN 'turn on', SMBH mass, as well as disc properties and the embedded population.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.4102M,[]
Observations of the very young Type Ia Supernova 2019np with early-excess emission,"Early-time radiative signals from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) can provide important constraints on the explosion mechanism and the progenitor system. We present observations and analysis of SN 2019np, a nearby SN Ia discovered within 1-2 days after the explosion. Follow-up observations were conducted in optical, ultraviolet, and near-infrared bands, covering the phases from ~-16.7 d to ~+ 367.8 d relative to its B-band peak luminosity. The photometric and spectral evolutions of SN 2019np resemble the average behaviour of normal SNe Ia. The absolute B-band peak magnitude and the post-peak decline rate are M<SUB>max</SUB>(B) = -19.52 ± 0.47 mag and Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(B) = 1.04 ± 0.04 mag, respectively. No Hydrogen line has been detected in the nebular-phase spectra of SN 2019np. Assuming that the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni powering the light curve is centrally located, we find that the bolometric light curve of SN 2019np shows a flux excess up to 5.0 per cent in the early phase compared to the radiative diffusion model. Such an extra radiation perhaps suggests the presence of an additional energy source beyond the radioactive decay of central nickel. Comparing the observed colour evolution with that predicted by different models, such as interactions of SN ejecta with circumstellar matter (CSM)/companion star, a double-detonation explosion from a sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf (WD) and surface <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mixing, we propose that the nickel mixing is more favoured for SN 2019np.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.3541S,[]
Coordinated time variability of multi-phase ultra-fast outflows in J132216.25 + 052446.3,"We present a time variability analysis of broad absorption lines (BAL; spread over the velocity range of 5800-29 000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) seen in the spectrum of J132216.25 + 052446.3 (z<SUB>em</SUB> = 2.04806) at ten different epochs spanning over 19 yr. The strongest absorption component (BAL-A; spread over 5800-9900 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) is made up of several narrow components having velocity separations close to C IV doublet splitting. The C IV, N V, and Si IV absorption from BAL-A show correlated optical depth variability without major changes in the velocity structure. A very broad and shallow absorption (BAL-C; spread over the velocity range 15 000-29 000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) emerged during our monitoring period coinciding with a dimming episode of J1322 + 0524. All the identified absorption lines show correlated variability with the equivalent widths increasing with decreasing flux. This together with the C IV emission line variability is consistent with ionization being the main driver of the correlated variability. The observed UV-continuum variations are weaker than what is required by the photoionization models. This together with a scatter in the C IV equivalent width at a given continuum flux can be understood if variations of the C IV ionizing photons are much larger than that of the UV continuum, the variations in the ionizing photon and UV fluxes are not correlated and/or the covering factor of the flow varies continuously. We suggest BAL-A is produced by a stable clumpy outflow located beyond the broad emission line region and BAL-C is a newly formed wind component located near the accretion disc and both respond to changes in the ionizing continuum.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.1975A,[]
ASTRI Mini-Array core science at the Observatorio del Teide,"The ASTRI (Astrofisica con Specchi a Tecnologia Replicante Italiana) Project led by the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) is developing and will deploy at the Observatorio del Teide a mini-array (ASTRI Mini-Array) composed of nine telescopes similar to the small-size dual-mirror Schwarzschild-Couder telescope (ASTRI-Horn) currently operating on the slopes of Mt.

The ASTRI Mini-Array will surpass the current Cherenkov telescope array differential sensitivity above a few tera-electronvolt (TeV), extending the energy band well above hundreds of TeV. This will allow us to explore a new window of the electromagnetic spectrum, by convolving the sensitivity performance with excellent angular and energy resolution figures. In this paper we describe the Core Science that we will address during the first four years of operation, providing examples of the breakthrough results that we will obtain when dealing with current open questions, such as the acceleration of cosmic rays, cosmology and fundamental physics and the new window, for the TeV energy band, of the time-domain astrophysics.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JHEAp..35....1V,[]
Machine learning applied to asteroid dynamics,"Machine learning (ML) is the branch of computer science that studies computer algorithms that can learn from data. It is mainly divided into supervised learning, where the computer is presented with examples of entries, and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs, and unsupervised learning, where no label is provided to the learning algorithm, leaving it alone to find structures. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning based on numerous layers of artificial neural networks, which are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. In asteroid dynamics, machine learning methods have been recently used to identify members of asteroid families, small bodies images in astronomical fields, and to identify resonant arguments images of asteroids in three-body resonances, among other applications. Here, we will conduct a full review of available literature in the field and classify it in terms of metrics recently used by other authors to assess the state of the art of applications of machine learning in other astronomical subfields. For comparison, applications of machine learning to Solar System bodies, a larger area that includes imaging and spectrophotometry of small bodies, have already reached a state classified as progressing. Research communities and methodologies are more established, and the use of ML led to the discovery of new celestial objects or features, or new insights in the area. ML applied to asteroid dynamics, however, is still in the emerging phase, with smaller groups, methodologies still not well-established, and fewer papers producing discoveries or insights. Large observational surveys, like those conducted at the Zwicky Transient Facility or at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, will produce in the next years very substantial datasets of orbital and physical properties for asteroids. Applications of ML for clustering, image identification, and anomaly detection, among others, are currently being developed and are expected of being of great help in the next few years.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022CeMDA.134...36C,[]
"Magnetar Engines in Fast Blue Optical Transients and Their Connections with SLSNe, SNe Ic-BL, and lGRBs","We fit the multiband lightcurves of 40 fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) with the magnetar engine model. The mass of the FBOT ejecta, the initial spin period, and the polar magnetic field of the FBOT magnetars are respectively constrained to ${M}_{\mathrm{ej}}={0.11}_{-0.09}^{+0.22}\,{M}_{\odot }$ , ${P}_{{\rm{i}}}={9.1}_{-4.4}^{+9.3}\,\mathrm{ms}$ , and ${B}_{{\rm{p}}}={11}_{-7}^{+18}\times {10}^{14}\,{\rm{G}}$ . The wide distribution of the value of B <SUB>p</SUB> spreads the parameter ranges of the magnetars from superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) to broad-line Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic-BL; some are observed to be associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts), which are also suggested to be driven by magnetars. Combining FBOTs with the other transients, we find a strong universal anticorrelation of ${P}_{{\rm{i}}}\propto {M}_{\mathrm{ej}}^{-0.41}$ , indicating they could share a common origin. To be specific, it is suspected that all of these transients originate from the collapse of extremely stripped stars in close binary systems, but with different progenitor masses. As a result, FBOTs distinguish themselves by their small ejecta masses with an upper limit of ~1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, which leads to an observational separation in the rise time of the lightcurves of ~10 days. In addition, FBOTs together with SLSNe can be separated from SNe Ic-BL by an empirical line in the M <SUB>peak</SUB>-t <SUB>rise</SUB> plane corresponding to an energy requirement of the mass of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni of ~0.3M <SUB>ej</SUB>, where M <SUB>peak</SUB> is the peak absolute magnitude of the transients and t <SUB>rise</SUB> is the rise time.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935L..34L,[]

Luminous Optical and X-Ray Flaring of the Putative Redback Millisecond Pulsar 1FGL J0523.5-2529,"Several redback and black widow millisecond pulsar binaries have episodes of flaring in X-rays and optical. We initially detected such behavior from the Fermi selected redback candidate 1FGL J0523.5-2529 during optical time-series monitoring. Triggered observations with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory over the next ≈100 days showed episodic flaring in X-rays with luminosity up to 8 × 10<SUP>33</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> (~100 times the minimum), and a comparable luminosity in the optical/UV, with similar power-law spectra of f <SUB> ν </SUB> ∝ ν <SUP>-0.7</SUP>. These are the most luminous flares seen in any nonaccreting ""spider"" pulsar system, which may be related to the large size of the companion through the fraction of the pulsar wind that it or its ablated wind intercepts. Simultaneously with an optical flare, we see Balmer line and He I emission, not previously known in this object, which is evidence of a stellar wind that may also inhibit detection of radio pulsations. The quiescent optical light curves, while dominated by ellipsoidal modulation, show evidence of variable nonuniform temperature that could be due either to large starspots or asymmetric heating of the companion by the pulsar. This may explain a previous measurement of unusual nonzero orbital eccentricity as, alternatively, distortion of the radial-velocity curve by the surface temperature distribution of the large companion.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935..151H,[]
Observing Scenarios for the Next Decade of Early Warning Detection of Binary Neutron Stars,"We describe representative observing scenarios for early warning detection of binary neutron star mergers with the current generation of ground-based gravitational wave detectors as they approach design sensitivity. We incorporate recent estimates of the infrastructure latency and detector sensitivities to provide up-to-date predictions. We use Fisher analysis to approximate the associated localizations, and we directly compare to Bayestar to quantify biases inherited from this approach. In particular, we show that Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo will detect and distribute ≲1 signal with signal-to-noise ratio greater than 15 before a merger in their fourth observing run provided they maintain a 70% duty cycle. This is consistent with previous early warning detection estimates. We estimate that 60% of all observations and 8% of those detectable 20 s before a merger will be localized to ≲100 deg<SUP>2</SUP>. If KAGRA is able to achieve a 25 Mpc horizon, 70% of these binary neutron stars will be localized to ≲100 deg<SUP>2</SUP> by a merger. As the Aundha-Hanford-KAGRA-Livingston-Virgo network approaches design sensitivity over the next ~10 yr, we expect one (six) early warning alerts to be distributed 60 (0) s before a merger. Although adding detectors to the Hanford-Livingston-Virgo network at design sensitivity impacts the detection rate at ≲50% level, it significantly improves localization prospects. Given uncertainties in sensitivities, participating detectors, and duty cycles, we consider 103 future detector configurations so electromagnetic observers can tailor preparations toward their preferred models.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935..139M,[]
Foraging with MUSHROOMS: A Mixed-integer Linear Programming Scheduler for Multimessenger Target of Opportunity Searches with the Zwicky Transient Facility,"Electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational-wave detections is very resource intensive, taking up hours of limited observation time on dozens of telescopes. Creating more efficient schedules for follow-up will lead to a commensurate increase in counterpart location efficiency without using more telescope time. Widely used in operations research and telescope scheduling, mixed-integer linear programming is a strong candidate to produce these higher-efficiency schedules, as it can make use of powerful commercial solvers that find globally optimal solutions to provided problems. We detail a new target-of-opportunity scheduling algorithm designed with Zwicky Transient Facility in mind that uses mixed-integer linear programming. We compare its performance to gwemopt, the tuned heuristic scheduler used by the Zwicky Transient Facility and other facilities during the third LIGO-Virgo gravitational-wave observing run. This new algorithm uses variable-length observing blocks to enforce cadence requirements and to ensure field observability, along with having a secondary optimization step to minimize slew time. We show that by employing a hybrid method utilizing both this scheduler and gwemopt, the previous scheduler used, in concert, we can achieve an average improvement in detection efficiency of 3%-11% over gwemopt alone for a simulated binary neutron star merger data set consistent with LIGO-Virgo's third observing run, highlighting the potential of mixed-integer target of opportunity schedulers for future multimessenger follow-up surveys.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935...87P,[]
Evolution of X-Ray Activity in <25 Myr Old Pre-main Sequence Stars,"Measuring the evolution of X-ray emission from pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars gives insight into two issues: the response of magnetic dynamo processes to changes in the interior structure, and the effects of high-energy radiation on protoplanetary disks and primordial planetary atmospheres. We present a sample of 6003 stars with ages 7-25 Myr in 10 nearby open clusters from Chandra X-ray and Gaia-EDR3 surveys. Combined with previous results in large samples of younger (≲5 Myr) stars in MYStIX and SFiNCs star-forming regions, mass-stratified activity-age relations are derived for the early phases of stellar evolution. X-ray luminosity (L <SUB> X </SUB>) is constant during the first few Myr, possibly due to the presence of extended X-ray coronas insensitive to temporal changes in stellar size. L <SUB> X </SUB> then decays during the 7-25 Myr period, more rapidly as stellar mass increases. This decay is interpreted as decreasing efficiency of the α <SUP>2</SUP> dynamo as radiative cores grow and a solar-type αΩ dynamo emerges. For more massive 3.5-7 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> fully radiative stars, the X-ray emission plummets-indicating the lack of an effective magnetic dynamo. The findings provide improved measurements of high-energy radiation effects on circumstellar material, first for the protoplanetary disk and then for the atmospheres of young planets. The observed X-ray luminosities can be so high that an inner Earth-mass rocky, unmagnetized planet around a solar-mass PMS star might lose its primary and secondary atmospheres within a few (several) million years. PMS X-ray emission may thus have a significant impact on the evolution of early-planetary atmospheres and the conditions promoting the rise of habitability.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935...43G,[]
SRGA J181414.6-225604: A New Galactic Symbiotic X-Ray Binary Outburst Triggered by an Intense Mass-loss Episode of a Heavily Obscured Mira Variable,"We present the discovery and multiwavelength characterization of SRGA J181414.6-225604, a Galactic hard X-ray transient discovered during the ongoing SRG/ART-XC sky survey. Using data from the Palomar Gattini-IR survey, we identify a spatially and temporally coincident variable infrared (IR) source, IRAS 18111-2257, and classify it as a very-late-type (M7-M8), long-period (1502 ± 24 days), and luminous (M <SUB> K </SUB> ≈ -9.9 ± 0.2) O-rich Mira donor star located at a distance of ≈14.6<SUP>+2.9</SUP> <SUB>-2.3</SUB> kpc. Combining multicolor photometric data over the last ≈25 yr, we show that the IR counterpart underwent a recent (starting ≈800 days before the X-ray flare) enhanced mass-loss (reaching ≈2.1 × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) episode, resulting in an expanding dust shell obscuring the underlying star. Multi-epoch follow-up observations from Swift, NICER, and NuSTAR reveal a ≈200 day long X-ray outburst reaching a peak luminosity of L <SUB>X</SUB> ≈ 2.5 × 10<SUP>36</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, characterized by a heavily absorbed (N <SUB>H</SUB> ≈ 6 × 10<SUP>22</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) X-ray spectrum consistent with an optically thick Comptonized plasma. The X-ray spectral and timing behavior suggest the presence of clumpy wind accretion, together with a dense ionized nebula overabundant in silicate material surrounding the compact object. Together, we show that SRGA J181414.6-225604 is a new symbiotic X-ray binary in outburst, triggered by an intense dust-formation episode of a highly evolved donor. Our results offer the first direct confirmation for the speculated connection between enhanced late-stage donor mass loss and the active lifetimes of symbiotic X-ray binaries.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935...36D,[]
Weak Mass Loss from the Red Supergiant Progenitor of the Type II SN 2021yja,"We present high-cadence optical, ultraviolet (UV), and near-infrared data of the nearby (D ≈ 23 Mpc) Type II supernova (SN) 2021yja. Many Type II SNe show signs of interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) during the first few days after explosion, implying that their red supergiant (RSG) progenitors experience episodic or eruptive mass loss. However, because it is difficult to discover SNe early, the diversity of CSM configurations in RSGs has not been fully mapped. SN 2021yja, first detected within ≈ 5.4 hours of explosion, shows some signatures of CSM interaction (high UV luminosity and radio and x-ray emission) but without the narrow emission lines or early light-curve peak that can accompany CSM. Here we analyze the densely sampled early light curve and spectral series of this nearby SN to infer the properties of its progenitor and CSM. We find that the most likely progenitor was an RSG with an extended envelope, encompassed by low-density CSM. We also present archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the host galaxy of SN 2021yja, which allows us to place a stringent upper limit of ≲ 9 M <SUB>☉</SUB> on the progenitor mass. However, this is in tension with some aspects of the SN evolution, which point to a more massive progenitor. Our analysis highlights the need to consider progenitor structure when making inferences about CSM properties, and that a comprehensive view of CSM tracers should be made to give a fuller view of the last years of RSG evolution.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935...31H,[]
Improving Astronomical Time-series Classification via Data Augmentation with Generative Adversarial Networks,"Due to the latest advances in technology, telescopes with significant sky coverage will produce millions of astronomical alerts per night that must be classified both rapidly and automatically. Currently, classification consists of supervised machine-learning algorithms whose performance is limited by the number of existing annotations of astronomical objects and their highly imbalanced class distributions. In this work, we propose a data augmentation methodology based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate a variety of synthetic light curves from variable stars. Our novel contributions, consisting of a resampling technique and an evaluation metric, can assess the quality of generative models in unbalanced data sets and identify GAN-overfitting cases that the Fréchet inception distance does not reveal. We applied our proposed model to two data sets taken from the Catalina and Zwicky Transient Facility surveys. The classification accuracy of variable stars is improved significantly when training with synthetic data and testing with real data with respect to the case of using only real data.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935...23G,[]
COol Companions ON Ultrawide orbiTS (COCONUTS). III. A Very Red L6 Benchmark Brown Dwarf around a Young M5 Dwarf,"We present the third discovery from the COol Companions ON Ultrawide orbiTS (COCONUTS) program, the COCONUTS-3 system, composed of the young M5 primary star UCAC4 374-046899 and the very red L6 dwarf WISEA J081322.19-152203.2. These two objects have a projected separation of $61^{\prime\prime} $ (1891 au) and are physically associated given their common proper motions and estimated distances. The primary star, COCONUTS-3A, has a mass of 0.123 ± 0.006 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, and we estimate its age as 100 Myr to 1 Gyr based on its stellar activity (via Hα and X-ray emission), kinematics, and spectrophotometric properties. We derive its bulk metallicity as 0.21 ± 0.07 dex using empirical calibrations established by older and higher-gravity M dwarfs and find that this [Fe/H] could be slightly underestimated according to PHOENIX models given COCONUTS-3A's younger age. The companion, COCONUTS-3B, has a near-infrared spectral type of L6 ± 1 INT-G, and we infer physical properties of T <SUB>eff</SUB> = ${1362}_{-73}^{+48}$ K, $\mathrm{log}(g)$ = ${4.96}_{-0.34}^{+0.15}$ dex, $R\,=\,{1.03}_{-0.06}^{+0.12}$ R <SUB>Jup</SUB>, and $M\,=\,{39}_{-18}^{+11}$ M <SUB>Jup</SUB> using its bolometric luminosity, its host star's age, and hot-start evolution models. We construct cloudy atmospheric model spectra at the evolution-based physical parameters and compare them to COCONUTS-3B's spectrophotometry. We find that this companion possesses ample condensate clouds in its photosphere (f <SUB>sed</SUB> = 1) with the data-model discrepancies likely due to the models using an older version of the opacity database. Compared to field-age L6 dwarfs, COCONUTS-3B has fainter absolute magnitudes and a 120 K cooler T <SUB>eff</SUB>. Also, the J - K color of this companion is among the reddest for ultracool benchmarks with ages older than a few hundred megayears. COCONUTS-3 likely formed in the same fashion as stellar binaries given the companion-to-host mass ratio of 0.3 and represents a valuable benchmark to quantify the systematics of substellar model atmospheres.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935...15Z,[]
A Uniform Type Ia Supernova Distance Ladder with the Zwicky Transient Facility: Absolute Calibration Based on the Tip of the Red Giant Branch Method,"The current Cepheid-calibrated distance ladder measurement of H <SUB>0</SUB> is reported to be in tension with the values inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), assuming standard cosmology. However, some tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) estimates report H <SUB>0</SUB> in better agreement with the CMB. Hence, it is critical to reduce systematic uncertainties in local measurements to understand the Hubble tension. In this paper, we propose a uniform distance ladder between the second and third rungs, combining Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) with a TRGB calibration of their absolute luminosity. A large, volume-limited sample of both calibrator and Hubble flow SNe Ia from the same survey minimizes two of the largest sources of systematics: host-galaxy bias and nonuniform photometric calibration. We present results from a pilot study using the existing TRGB distance to the host galaxy of ZTF SN Ia SN 2021rhu (aka ZTF21abiuvdk) in NGC7814. Combining the ZTF calibrator with a volume-limited sample from the first data release of ZTF Hubble flow SNe Ia, we infer H <SUB>0</SUB> = 76.94 ± 6.4 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>, an 8.3% measurement. The error budget is dominated by the single object calibrating the SN Ia luminosity in this pilot study. However, the ZTF sample includes already five other SNe Ia within ~20 Mpc for which TRGB distances can be obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. Finally, we present the prospects of building this distance ladder out to 80 Mpc with James Webb Space Telescope observations of more than 100 ZTF SNe Ia.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...934..185D,[]
1RXH J082623.6-505741: A New Long-period Cataclysmic Variable with an Evolved Donor and a Low Mass-transfer Rate,"We report the discovery of 1RXH J082623.6-505741, a 10.4 hr orbital period compact binary. Modeling extensive optical photometry and spectroscopy reveals a ~0.4 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> K-type secondary transferring mass through a low-state accretion disk to a nonmagnetic ~0.8 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> white dwarf. The secondary is overluminous for its mass and dominates the optical spectra at all epochs and must be evolved to fill its Roche Lobe at this orbital period. The X-ray luminosity L <SUB> X </SUB> ~ 1-2 × 10<SUP>32</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> derived from both new XMM-Newton and archival observations, although high compared to most CVs, still only requires a modest accretion rate onto the white dwarf of $\dot{M}$ ~ 3 × 10<SUP>-11</SUP> to 3 × 10<SUP>-10</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, lower than expected for a cataclysmic variable with an evolved secondary. No dwarf nova outbursts have yet been observed from the system, consistent with the low derived mass-transfer rate. Several other cataclysmic variables with similar orbital periods also show unexpectedly low mass-transfer rates, even though selection effects disfavor the discovery of binaries with these properties. This suggests the abundance and evolutionary state of long-period, low mass-transfer rate cataclysmic variables are worthy of additional attention.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...934..142S,[]
The X-Ray and Radio Loud Fast Blue Optical Transient AT2020mrf: Implications for an Emerging Class of Engine-driven Massive Star Explosions,"We present AT2020mrf (SRGe J154754.2+443907), an extra-galactic (z = 0.1353) fast blue optical transient (FBOT) with a rise time of t <SUB> g,rise</SUB> = 3.7 days and a peak luminosity of M <SUB> g,peak</SUB> = -20.0. Its optical spectrum around peak shows a broad (v ~ 0.1c) emission feature on a blue continuum (T ~ 2 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> K), which bears a striking resemblance to AT2018cow. Its bright radio emission (ν L <SUB> ν </SUB> = 1.2 × 10<SUP>39</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>; ν <SUB>rest</SUB> = 7.4 GHz; 261 days) is similar to four other AT2018cow-like events, and can be explained by synchrotron radiation from the interaction between a sub-relativistic (≳0.07-0.08c) forward shock and a dense environment ( $\dot{M}\lesssim {10}^{-3}\,{M}_{\odot }\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$ for v <SUB>w</SUB> = 10<SUP>3</SUP> km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). AT2020mrf occurs in a galaxy with M <SUB>*</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>8</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> and specific star formation rate ~10<SUP>-10</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, supporting the idea that AT2018cow-like events are preferentially hosted by dwarf galaxies. The X-ray luminosity of AT2020mrf is the highest among FBOTs. At 35-37 days, SRG/eROSITA detected luminous (L <SUB>X</SUB> ~ 2 × 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>; 0.3-10 keV) X-ray emission. The X-ray spectral shape (f <SUB> ν </SUB> ∝ ν <SUP>-0.8</SUP>) and erratic intraday variability are reminiscent of AT2018cow, but the luminosity is a factor of ~20 greater than AT2018cow. At 328 days, Chandra detected it at L <SUB>X</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is >200 times more luminous than AT2018cow and CSS161010. At the same time, the X-ray emission remains variable on the timescale of ~1 day. We show that a central engine, probably a millisecond magnetar or an accreting black hole, is required to power the explosion. We predict the rates at which events like AT2018cow and AT2020mrf will be detected by SRG and Einstein Probe.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...934..104Y,[]
The Nature of Luminous Quasars with Very Large C IV Equivalent Widths,"We report results for a complete sample of 10 luminous radio-quiet quasars with large C IV equivalent widths (EW ≥ 150 Å). For 8/10 we performed Chandra snapshot observations. We find that, in addition to the enhanced C IV line EW, their He II and Mg II lines are enhanced, but the C III] line is not. Their X-ray emission is substantially stronger than expected from their ultraviolet luminosity. Additionally, these large C IV EW quasars show small C IV blueshifts and possibly low Eddington ratios, suggesting that they are ""extreme low Eigenvector 1 (EV1)"" quasars. The mean excess He II EW is well matched by radiation pressure compression (RPC) photoionization models, with the harder α <SUB>ox</SUB> ionizing spectrum. However, these results do not reproduce well the enhancement pattern of the C IV, Mg II, and C III] EWs, or the observed high C IV/Mg II ratio. RPC calculations indicate that the C IV/Mg II line ratio is an effective metallicity indicator, and models with subsolar-metallicity gas and a hard ionizing continuum reproduce well the enhancement pattern of all four ultraviolet lines. We find that the C IV/Mg II line ratio in quasars is generally correlated with the excess X-ray emission. Extremely high EV1 quasars are characterized by high metallicity and suppressed X-ray emission. The underlying mechanism relating gas metallicity and X-ray emission is not clear but may be related to radiation-pressure-driven disk winds, which are enhanced at high metallicity, and consequent mass loading reducing coronal X-ray emission.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...934...97F,[]
Traversable wormholes with charge and non-commutative geometry in the f(Q) gravity,"We consider modified symmetric teleparallel gravity (STG), in which gravitational Lagrangian is given by the arbitrary function of non-metricity scalar Q to study static and spherically symmetric charged traversable wormhole solutions with non-commutative background geometry. The matter source at the wormhole throat is acknowledged to be anisotropic, and the redshift function has a constant value (thus, our wormhole solution is non-tidal). We study the obtained field equations with the two functional forms of f(Q) STG models, such as linear f(Q) = αQ + β and non-linear f(Q) = Q + mQ<SUP>n</SUP> models under Gaussian and Lorentzian distributions. Our analysis found the exact wormhole solutions for the linear STG model only. Also, for the non-linear model, we derived numerically suitable forms of wormhole shape functions directly from the modified Einstein Field Equations (EFEs). Besides, we probed these models via Null, Dominant, and Strong energy conditions with respect to free Modified gravity (MOG) parameters α, β, m, and n. We also used Tolman-Oppenheimer-Vokloff (TOV) equation to investigate the stability of wormhole anisotropic matter in considered MOG. Finally, we plot the equation of state.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AnPhy.44368968S,[]
Asteroseismology Across the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram,"Asteroseismology has grown from its beginnings three decades ago to a mature field teeming with discoveries and applications. This phenomenal growth has been enabled by space photometry with precision 10-100 times better than ground-based observations, with nearly continuous light curves for durations of weeks to years, and by large-scale ground-based surveys spanning years designed to detect all time-variable phenomena. The new high-precision data are full of surprises, deepening our understanding of the physics of stars. This review explores asteroseismic developments from the past decade primarily as a result of light curves from the Kepler and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite space missions for massive upper main sequence OBAF stars, pre-main-sequence stars, peculiar stars, classical pulsators, white dwarfs and subdwarfs, and tidally interacting close binaries. The space missions have increased the numbers of pulsators in many classes by an order of magnitude. Asteroseismology measures fundamental stellar parameters and stellar interior physics-mass, radius, age, metallicity, luminosity, distance, magnetic fields, interior rotation, angular momentum transfer, convective overshoot, core-burning stage-supporting disparate fields such as galactic archeology, exoplanet host stars, supernovae progenitors, gamma-ray and gravitational wave precursors, close binary star origins and evolution, and standard candles. Stars are the luminous tracers of the Universe. Asteroseismology significantly improves models of stellar structure and evolution on which all inference from stars depends.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ARA&A..60...31K,[]
The Astronomy Commons Platform: A Deployable Cloud-based Analysis Platform for Astronomy,"We present a scalable, cloud-based science platform solution designed to enable next-to-the-data analyses of terabyte-scale astronomical tabular data sets. The presented platform is built on Amazon Web Services (over Kubernetes and S3 abstraction layers), utilizes Apache Spark and the Astronomy eXtensions for Spark for parallel data analysis and manipulation, and provides the familiar JupyterHub web-accessible front end for user access. We outline the architecture of the analysis platform, provide implementation details and rationale for (and against) technology choices, verify scalability through strong and weak scaling tests, and demonstrate usability through an example science analysis of data from the Zwicky Transient Facility's 1Bn+ light-curve catalog. Furthermore, we show how this system enables an end user to iteratively build analyses (in Python) that transparently scale processing with no need for end-user interaction. The system is designed to be deployable by astronomers with moderate cloud engineering knowledge, or (ideally) IT groups. Over the past 3 yr, it has been utilized to build science platforms for the DiRAC Institute, the ZTF partnership, the LSST Solar System Science Collaboration, and the LSST Interdisciplinary Network for Collaboration and Computing, as well as for numerous short-term events (with over 100 simultaneous users).

TOI-3714 b and TOI-3629 b: Two Gas Giants Transiting M Dwarfs Confirmed with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder and NEID,"We confirm the planetary nature of two gas giants discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to transit M dwarfs.

Evaluating the V-band Photometric Metallicity with Fundamental Mode RR Lyrae in the Kepler Field,"The aim of this work is to evaluate the performance of photometric metallicity [Fe/H], determined based on V-band light curves photometrically transformed from the gr-band light curves. We tested this by using a set of homogeneous samples of fundamental mode RR Lyrae located in the Kepler field. It was found that the color term is necessary in such photometric transformation. We demonstrated that when including the color term the determined photometric [Fe/H] are in good agreement with the spectroscopic [Fe/H], either based on the calibrated or the transformed V-band light curves. We also tested the impact of Blazhko RR Lyrae in determining the photometric [Fe/H], and found that Blazhko RR Lyrae can give consistent photometric [Fe/H]. Finally, we derived independent gVr-band [Fe/H]-ϕ <SUB>31</SUB>-P relations (where ϕ <SUB>31</SUB> and P are the Fourier parameter and pulsation period, respectively) using our light curves.

TUVO-21acq: A new cataclysmic variable discovered through a UV outburst,"Outbursts from cataclysmic variables, such as dwarf novae (DNe), are prevalent throughout the galaxy and are known to emit strongly in the ultraviolet (UV). However, the UV emission of DN outbursts has not been studied extensively compared with the optical. Detailed characterisation of the physical processes responsible for outburst behaviour requires further UV data, because the UV probes the inner regions of the accretion disc. Here we report, as part of our recently launched Transient UV Objects (TUVO) project, the discovery of TUVO-21acq, a new transient which we detected in the UV using data from the Ultraviolet Optical Telescope (UVOT) aboard Swift. We detected two separate outbursts and used the UVOT data to constrain source properties, focusing on the amplitudes and timescales of the outbursts. We found that during the first outburst the source increased in brightness by at least 4.1, 2.4, and 3.5 mag and during the second outburst by 4.4, 3.4, and 3.6 mag in the UVW1, UVM2, and UVW2 bands, respectively. The outburst durations were in the range of 6-21 days and 11-46 days, and we determined an upper limit for the recurrence time of 316 days. To further characterise the source, we obtained an optical spectrum during quiescence with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). The spectrum exhibited hydrogen Balmer series and helium emission lines, and a flat overall spectral shape. We confirm the nature of the source as an accreting white dwarf which underwent DN outburst based on photometric and spectroscopic properties. This study serves as a proof of concept for the TUVO project strategy, demonstrating that it has the capability of discovering and classifying new, interesting UV transients. We also discuss the implications of our findings for our understanding of the physics underlying DN outbursts, in particular with respect to the UV emission. We examine the need for simultaneous UV and optical observations during the onset of DN outbursts in order to help answer remaining questions as to the characteristics and implications of the UV delay, for example.",,[]

Energetic nuclear transients in luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies,"Energetic nuclear outbursts have been discovered in luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs) at unexpectedly high rates. To investigate this population of transients, we performed a search in mid-IR data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite and its NEOWISE survey to detect and characterise luminous and smoothly evolving transients in a sample of 215 U/LIRGs. We report three new transients, all with ΔL > 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>−1</SUP>, in addition to two previously known cases. Their host galaxies are all part of major galaxy mergers, and through radiative transfer model fitting we find that all have a significant contribution from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We characterised the transients through measurements of their luminosities and resulting energetics, all of which are between 10<SUP>50.9</SUP> erg and 10<SUP>52.2</SUP> erg. The IR emission of the five transients was found to be consistent with re-radiation by the hot dust of emission at shorter wavelengths, presumably originating from an accretion event, onto the supermassive black hole. The corresponding transient rate of (1.6-4.6) × 10<SUP>−3</SUP> yr<SUP>−1</SUP> galaxy<SUP>−1</SUP> is over an order of magnitude higher than the rate of large amplitude flares shown by AGN in the optical. We suggest that the observed transients are part of a dust-obscured population of tidal disruption events (TDEs) that have remained out of the reach of optical surveys due to the obscuring dust. In one case, this is supported by our radio observations. We also discuss other plausible explanations. The observed rate of events is significantly higher than optical TDE rates, which can be expected in U/LIRG hosts undergoing a major galaxy merger with increased stellar densities in the nuclear regions. Continued searches for such transients and their multi-wavelength follow-up is required to constrain their rate and nature.",,[]

Milky Way archaeology using RR Lyrae and type II Cepheids. II. High-velocity RR Lyrae stars and Milky Way mass,"We report the discovery of high-velocity candidates among RR Lyrae stars found in the Milky Way halo. We identified nine RR Lyrae stars with Galactocentric velocities exceeding the local escape velocity based on the assumed Galaxy potential. Furthermore, based on a close examination of their orbits', we ruled out their ejection location in the Milky Way disk and bulge. The spatial distribution revealed that seven out of nine pulsators overlap with the position of the Sagittarius stellar stream. Two out of these seven RR Lyrae stars can be tentatively linked to the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy on the basis of their orbits. Focusing on the high-velocity tail of the RR Lyrae velocity distribution, we estimated the escape velocity in the Solar neighborhood to be v<SUB>esc</SUB> = 512<SUB>−37</SUB><SUP>+94</SUP> km s<SUP>−1</SUP> (4 to 12 kpc); and beyond the Solar neighborhood as v<SUB>esc</SUB> = 436<SUB>−22</SUB><SUP>+44</SUP> km s<SUP>−1</SUP> and v<SUB>esc</SUB> = 393<SUB>−26</SUB><SUP>+53</SUP> km s<SUP>−1</SUP> (for distances between 12 to 20 kpc and 20 to 28 kpc), respectively.

In the era of large surveys and space missions, it is necessary to rely on large samples of well-characterized stars for inter-calibrating and comparing measurements from different surveys and catalogues. Among the most employed photometric systems, the Johnson-Kron-Cousins has been used for decades and for a large amount of important datasets.",,[]
"Aims: Our goal is to profit from the Gaia EDR3 data, Gaia official cross-match algorithm, and Gaia-derived literature catalogues, to provide a well-characterized and clean sample of secondary standards in the Johnson-Kron-Cousins system, as well as a set of transformations between the main photometric systems and the Johnson-Kron-Cousins one.",,,[]
"Methods: Using Gaia as a reference, as well as data from reddening maps, spectroscopic surveys, and variable stars monitoring surveys, we curated and characterized the widely used Landolt and Stetson collections of more than 200 000 secondary standards, employing classical as well as machine learning techniques. In particular, our atmospheric parameters agree significantly better with spectroscopic ones, compared to other machine learning catalogues. We also cross-matched the curated collections with the major photometric surveys to provide a comprehensive set of reliable measurements in the most widely adopted photometric systems.",,,[]
"Results: We provide a curated catalogue of secondary standards in the Johnson-Kron-Cousins system that are well-measured and as free as possible from variable and multiple sources. We characterize the collection in terms of astrophysical parameters, distance, reddening, and radial velocity. We provide a table with the magnitudes of the secondary standards in the most widely used photometric systems (ugriz, grizy, Gaia, HIPPARCOS, Tycho, 2MASS). We finally provide a set of 167 polynomial transformations, valid for dwarfs and giants, metal-poor and metal-rich stars, to transform UBVRI magnitudes in the above photometric systems and vice-versa.",,,[]

Multiply eclipsing candidates from the TESS satellite,"We present a catalogue of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) targets that show multiple eclipses. In all of these stars, we detected two sets of eclipses, for which their two distinctive periods can be derived. These multiple stellar systems could either be doubly eclipsing quadruples or triple-star coplanar systems showing eclipses on the outer orbit in addition to the inner eclipses. In total, 116 systems were found to be doubly eclipsing, while 25 stars were identified as triply eclipsing triples. Several confirmed blends of two close sources were not included in our analysis. All these systems were identified by scanning the known eclipsing systems taken from the Variable Star Index database and checking their TESS light curves. The average period of the dominant pair, pair A, is 2.7 days in our sample, while for the second pair, pair B, the average period is 5.3 days. Several systems show evident eclipse timing variation (ETV) changes even from the short interval of the TESS data, indicating possible period changes and short mutual orbit. We also present evidence that the system V0871 Cen is probably a septuple-star system of architecture (Aa-Ab)-B-C-D. Most of the presented systems are adequately bright and show deep enough eclipses for observing, and therefore we call for new ground-based observations for these extremely interesting multiples. Owing to this motivation, we have included also the ephemerides for both pairs of each system, our catalogue also contains their depths of eclipses and the light-curve shapes as extracted from the TESS data. These new ground-based observations would be very useful for further derivation of the mutual movement of both pairs on their orbit via detection of the ETVs of both pairs for example.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...664A..96Z,[]
O'TRAIN: A robust and flexible `real or bogus' classifier for the study of the optical transient sky,"Context. Scientific interest in studying high-energy transient phenomena in the Universe has risen sharply over the last decade. At present, multiple ground-based survey projects have emerged to continuously monitor the optical (and multi-messenger) transient sky at higher image cadences and covering ever larger portions of the sky every night. These novel approaches are leading to a substantial increase in global alert rates, which need to be handled with care, especially with regard to keeping the level of false alarms as low as possible. Therefore, the standard transient detection pipelines previously designed for narrow field-of-view instruments must now integrate more sophisticated tools to deal with the growing number and diversity of alerts and false alarms.",,[]
Aims: Deep machine learning algorithms have now proven their efficiency in recognising patterns in images. These methods are now used in astrophysics to perform different classification tasks such as identifying bogus from real transient point-like sources. We explore this method to provide a robust and flexible algorithm that could be included in any kind of transient detection pipeline.,,,[]
"Methods: We built a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm in order to perform a `real or bogus' classification task on transient candidate cutouts (subtraction residuals) provided by different kinds of optical telescopes. The training involved human-supervised labelling of the cutouts, which are split into two balanced data sets with `true' and `false' point-like source candidates. We tested our CNN model on the candidates produced by two different transient detection pipelines. In addition, we made use of several diagnostic tools to evaluate the classification performance of our CNN models.",,,[]
"Results: We show that our CNN algorithm can be successfully trained on a large and diverse array of images on very different pixel scales. In this training process, we did not detect any strong over- or underfitting with the requirement of providing cutouts with a limited size no larger than 50 × 50 pixels. Tested on optical images from four different telescopes and utilising two different transient detection pipelines, our CNN model provides a robust `real or bogus' classification performance accuracy from 93% up to 98% for well-classified candidates.",,,[]

Quantum gravity phenomenology at the dawn of the multi-messenger era-A review,"The exploration of the universe has recently entered a new era thanks to the multi-messenger paradigm, characterized by a continuous increase in the quantity and quality of experimental data that is obtained by the detection of the various cosmic messengers (photons, neutrinos, cosmic rays and gravitational waves) from numerous origins. They give us information about their sources in the universe and the properties of the intergalactic medium. Moreover, multi-messenger astronomy opens up the possibility to search for phenomenological signatures of quantum gravity. On the one hand, the most energetic events allow us to test our physical theories at energy regimes which are not directly accessible in accelerators; on the other hand, tiny effects in the propagation of very high energy particles could be amplified by cosmological distances. After decades of merely theoretical investigations, the possibility of obtaining phenomenological indications of Planck-scale effects is a revolutionary step in the quest for a quantum theory of gravity, but it requires cooperation between different communities of physicists (both theoretical and experimental). This review, prepared within the COST Action CA18108 ""Quantum gravity phenomenology in the multi-messenger approach"", is aimed at promoting this cooperation by giving a state-of-the art account of the interdisciplinary expertise that is needed in the effective search of quantum gravity footprints in the production, propagation and detection of cosmic messengers.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PrPNP.12503948A,[]
Strongly lensed type Ia supernovae as a precise late-Universe probe of measuring the Hubble constant and cosmic curvature,"Strongly lensed type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are expected to have some advantages in measuring time delays of multiple images, and so they have a great potential to be developed into a powerful late-Universe cosmological probe. In this paper, we simulate a sample of lensed SNe Ia with time-delay measurements in the era of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Based on the distance sum rule, we use lensed SNe Ia to implement cosmological model-independent constraints on the Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB> and cosmic curvature parameter Ω<SUB>K</SUB> in the late Universe. We find that if 20 lensed SNe Ia could be observed, the constraint on H<SUB>0</SUB> is better than the measurement by the SH0ES Collaboration. When the event number of lensed SNe Ia increases to 100, the constraint precision of H<SUB>0</SUB> is comparable with the result from Planck 2018 data. Considering 200 lensed SNe Ia events as the optimistic estimation, we obtain Δ H<SUB>0</SUB>=0.33 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>−1</SUP> and Δ Ω<SUB>K</SUB>=0.053 . In addition, we also simulate lensed quasars in different scenarios to make a comparison and we find that they are still a useful cosmological probe even though the constraint precision from them is much less than that obtained from lensed SNe Ia. In the era of LSST, the measurements of time delay from both lensed SNe Ia and lensed quasars are expected to yield the results of Δ H<SUB>0</SUB>=0.26 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>−1</SUP> and Δ Ω<SUB>K</SUB>=0.044 .",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PhRvD.106b3520Q,[]
The LCO Outbursting Objects Key Project: Overview and Year 1 Status,"The LCO Outbursting Objects Key (LOOK) Project uses the telescopes of the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) Network to (1) systematically monitor a sample of previously discovered over the whole sky, to assess the evolutionary state of these distant remnants from the early solar system, and (2) use alerts from existing sky surveys to rapidly respond to and characterize detected outburst activity in all small bodies. The data gathered on outbursts helps to characterize each outburst's evolution with time, helps to assess the frequency and magnitude distribution of outbursts in general, and contributes to the understanding of outburst processes and volatile distribution in the solar system. The LOOK Project exploits the synergy between current and future wide-field surveys such as ZTF, Pan-STARRS, and LSST, as well as rapid-response telescope networks such as LCO, and serves as an excellent test bed for what will be needed for the much larger number of objects coming from Rubin Observatory. We will describe the LOOK Project goals, the planning and target selection (including the use of NEOexchange as a Target and Observation Manager or ""TOM""), and results from the first phase of observations, including the detection of activity and outbursts on the giant comet C/2014 UN<SUB>271</SUB> (Bernardinelli-Bernstein) and the discovery and follow-up of 28 outbursts on 14 comets. Within these outburst discoveries, we present a high-cadence light curve of 7P/Pons-Winnecke with 10 outbursts observed over 90 days, a large outburst on 57P/duToit-Neujmin-Delporte, and evidence that comet P/2020 X1 (ATLAS) was in outburst when discovered.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PSJ.....3..173L,[]

The stability of Casimir traversable wormholes in different modified gravity theories is also analyzed in our paper with a modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Voklov (MTOV) equation. Besides, we have numerically solved MTOV and derived hydrodynamical, anisotropic and extra forces, that is present due to the non-conserved stress-energy tensor.

Estimating transient rates from cosmological simulations and BPASS,"The detection rate of electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) transients is growing exponentially. As the accuracy of the transient rates will significantly improve over the coming decades, so will our understanding of their evolution through cosmic history. To this end, we present predicted rates for EM and GW transients over the age of the universe using Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) results combined with four cosmic star formation histories (SFHs). These include a widely used empirical SFH of Madau & Dickinson and those from three cosmological simulations: MilliMillennium, EAGLE, and IllustrisTNG. We find that the choice of SFH changes our predictions: transients with short delay times are most affected by the star formation rate and change up to a factor of 2, while long delay time events tend to depend on the metallicity evolution of star formation and can change the predicted rate up to an order of magnitude. Importantly, we find that the cosmological simulations have very different metallicity evolution that cannot be reproduced by the widely used metallicity model of Langer & Norman, which impacts the binary black hole merger, stripped-envelope supernovae, and LGRBs in the local Universe most acutely. We recommend against using simple prescriptions for the metallicity evolution of the universe when predicting the rates of events that can have long delay times and that are sensitive to metallicity evolution.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.1315B,[]
Nothing to see here: failed supernovae are faint or rare,"The absence of Type IIP core-collapse supernovae arising from progenitors above 17 solar masses suggests the existence of another evolutionary path by which massive stars end their lives. The direct collapse of a stellar core to a black hole without the production of a bright, explosive transient is expected to produce a long-lived, dim, red transient known as a failed supernova. Despite the detection of a number of candidates for disappearing massive stars in recent years, conclusive observational evidence for failed supernovae remains elusive. A custom-built pipeline designed for the detection of faint transients is used to re-analyse 10 yr of observations of 231 nearby galaxies from the PTF/ZTF surveys. This analysis recovers known supernovae, and yields a number of interesting transients. However, none of these are consistent with a failed supernova. Through Monte Carlo tests the recovery efficiency of our pipeline is quantified. By assuming failed supernovae occur as a Poissonian process with zero detections in the data set, 95 per cent upper limits to the rate of failed supernovae are calculated as a function of failed supernova absolute magnitude. We estimate failed supernovae to be less than 0.61, 0.33, 0.26, or 0.23 of the core-collapse SN rate for absolute magnitudes of -11, -12, -13, and -14, respectively. Finally, we show that if they exist, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will find 1.7-3.7 failed SNe per year for an absolute bolometric luminosity of ~6 × 10<SUP>39</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> out to distances of 33-43 Mpc, depending on their assumed spectral energy distribution.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.1188B,[]
Stellar graveyards: clustering of compact objects in globular clusters NGC 3201 and NGC 6397,"We analyse Gaia EDR3 and re-calibrated HST proper motion data from the core-collapsed and non-core-collapsed globular clusters NGC 6397 and NGC 3201, respectively, with the Bayesian mass-orbit modelling code MAMPOSST-PM. We use Bayesian evidence and realistic mock data sets constructed with AGAMA to select between different mass models. In both clusters, the velocities are consistent with isotropy within the extent of our data. We robustly detect a dark central mass (DCM) of roughly $1000\, \rm M_\odot$ in both clusters. Our MAMPOSST-PM fits strongly prefer an extended DCM in NGC 6397, while only presenting a mild preference for it in NGC 3201, with respective sizes of a roughly one and a few per cent of the cluster effective radius. We explore the astrophysics behind our results with the CMC Monte Carlo N-body code, whose snapshots best matching the phase space observations lead to similar values for the mass and size of the DCM. The internal kinematics are thus consistent with a population of hundreds of massive white dwarfs in NGC 6397, and roughly 100 segregated stellar-mass black holes in NGC 3201, as previously found with CMC. Such analyses confirm the accuracy of both mass-orbit modelling and Monte Carlo N-body techniques, which together provide more robust predictions on the DCM of globular clusters (core-collapsed or not). This opens possibilities to understand a vast range of interesting astrophysical phenomena in clusters, such as fast radio bursts, compact object mergers, and gravitational waves.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514..806V,[]

"Discovery of a highly eccentric, chromospherically active binary: ASASSN-V J192114.84+624950.8","As part of an All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) search for sources with large flux decrements, we discovered a transient where the quiescent, stellar source ASASSN-V J192114.84+624950.8 rapidly decreased in flux by $\sim 55{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ (~0.9 mag) in the g band. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite light curve revealed that the source is a highly eccentric, eclipsing binary. Fits to the light curve using PHOEBE find the binary orbit to have e = 0.79, P<SUB>orb</SUB> = 18.462 d, and i = 88.6°, and the ratios of the stellar radii and temperatures to be R<SUB>2</SUB>/R<SUB>1</SUB> = 0.71 and T<SUB>e,2</SUB>/T<SUB>e,1</SUB> = 0.82. Both stars are chromospherically active, allowing us to determine their rotational periods of P<SUB>1</SUB> = 1.52 d and P<SUB>2</SUB> = 1.79 d, respectively. A Large Binocular Telescope/Multi-Object Double Spectrograph spectrum shows that the primary is a late-G- or early-K-type dwarf. Fits to the spectral energy distribution show that the luminosities and temperatures of the two stars are L<SUB>1</SUB> = 0.48 L<SUB>⊙</SUB>, $T_1= 5050\, \mathrm{K}$, L<SUB>2</SUB> = 0.12 L<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and $T_{2} = 4190\, \mathrm{K}$.

How long can luminous blue variables sleep? A long-term photometric variability and spectral study of the Galactic candidate luminous blue variable MN 112,"Luminous blue variables (LBVs) are massive stars that show strong spectral and photometric variability. The questions of what evolutionary stages they represent and what exactly drives their instability are still open, and thus it is important to understand whether LBVs without significant ongoing activity exist, and for how long such dormant LBVs may 'sleep'. In this paper we investigate the long-term variability properties of the LBV candidate MN 112, by combining its optical and infrared spectral data covering 12 years with photometric data covering nearly a century, as acquired from both modern time-domain sky surveys and historical photographic plates. We analyse the spectra, derive the physical properties of the star by modelling its atmosphere, and use a new distance estimate from Gaia data release 3 (DR3) to determine the position of MN 112 both inside the Galaxy and in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The distance estimation has almost doubled in comparison with Gaia DR2. Because of this, MN 112 moved to upper part of the diagram, and according to our modelling it lies on an evolutionary track for a star with initial mass $M_*=70~\rm M_\odot$ near the Humphreys-Davidson limit. Given the absence of any significant variability, we conclude that the star is a dormant LBV that has now been inactive for at least a century.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.5752M,[]
SN 2020acat: an energetic fast rising Type IIb supernova,"The ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) photometric and optical spectroscopic observations of SN 2020acat covering ~250 d after explosion are presented here. Using the fast rising photometric observations, spanning from the UV to NIR wavelengths, a pseudo-bolometric light curve was constructed and compared to several other well-observed Type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb). SN 2020acat displayed a very short rise time reaching a peak luminosity of $\mathrm{{\rm Log}_{10}}(L) = 42.49 \pm 0.17 \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ in only ~14.6 ± 0.3 d. From modelling of the pseudo-bolometric light curve, we estimated a total mass of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni synthesized by SN 2020acat of M<SUB>Ni</SUB> = 0.13 ± 0.03 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with an ejecta mass of M<SUB>ej</SUB> = 2.3 ± 0.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a kinetic energy of E<SUB>k</SUB> = 1.2 ± 0.3 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg. The optical spectra of SN 2020acat display hydrogen signatures well into the transitional period (≳ 100 d), between the photospheric and the nebular phases. The spectra also display a strong feature around 4900 Å that cannot be solely accounted for by the presence of the Fe II 5018 line. We suggest that the Fe II feature was augmented by He I 5016 and possibly by the presence of N II 5005.

"Low luminosity Type II supernovae - IV. SN 2020cxd and SN 2021aai, at the edges of the sub-luminous supernovae class","Photometric and spectroscopic data for two Low Luminosity Type IIP Supernovae (LL SNe IIP) 2020cxd and 2021aai are presented. SN 2020cxd was discovered 2 d after explosion at an absolute magnitude of M<SUB>r</SUB> = -14.02 ± 0.21 mag, subsequently settling on a plateau which lasts for ~120 d. Through the luminosity of the late light curve tail, we infer a synthesized <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass of (1.8 ± 0.5) × 10<SUP>-3 </SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. During the early evolutionary phases, optical spectra show a blue continuum ($T\,  $8000 K) with broad Balmer lines displaying a P Cygni profile, while at later phases, Ca II, Fe II, Sc II, and Ba II lines dominate the spectra. Hydrodynamical modelling of the observables yields $R\, \simeq$ 575 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> for the progenitor star, with M<SUB>ej</SUB> = 7.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and $E\, \simeq$ 0.097 foe emitted during the explosion. This low-energy event originating from a low-mass progenitor star is compatible with both the explosion of a red supergiant (RSG) star and with an Electron Capture Supernova arising from a super asymptotic giant branch star. SN 2021aai reaches a maximum luminosity of M<SUB>r</SUB> = -16.57 ± 0.23 mag (correcting for A<SUB>V</SUB> = 1.92 mag), at the end of its remarkably long plateau (~140 d). The estimated <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass is (1.4 ± 0.5) × 10<SUP>-2</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The expansion velocities are compatible with those of other LL SNe IIP (few 10<SUP>3</SUP> km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The physical parameters obtained through hydrodynamical modelling are $R\, \simeq$ 575 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>, M<SUB>ej</SUB> = 15.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and E = 0.4 foe. SN 2021aai is therefore interpreted as the explosion of an RSG, with properties that bridge the class of LL SNe IIP with standard SN IIP events.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.4983V,[]
SN 2019va: a Type IIP Supernova with Large Influence of Nickel-56 Decay on the Plateau-phase Light Curve,"We present multiband photometric and spectroscopic observations of the type II supernova, (SN) 2019va, which shows an unusually flat plateau-phase evolution in its V-band light curve. Its pseudo-bolometric light curve even shows a weak brightening towards the end of the plateau phase. These uncommon features are related to the influence of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni decay on the light curve during the plateau phase, when the SN emission is usually dominated by cooling of the envelope. The inferred <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass of SN 2019va is 0.088 ± 0.018 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, which is significantly larger than most SNe II. To estimate the influence of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni decay on the plateau-phase light curve, we calculate the ratio (dubbed as η<SUB>Ni</SUB>) between the integrated time-weighted energy from <SUP>56</SUP>Ni decay and that from envelope cooling within the plateau phase, obtaining a value of 0.8 for SN 2019va, which is the second largest value among SNe II that has been measured. After removing the influence of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni decay on the plateau-phase light curve, we found that the progenitor/explosion parameters derived for SN 2019va are more reasonable. In addition, SN 2019va is found to have weaker metal lines in its spectra compared to other SNe IIP at similar epochs, implying a low-metallicity progenitor, which is consistent with the metal-poor environment inferred from the host-galaxy spectrum. We further discuss the possible reasons that might lead to SN 2019va-like events.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.4556Z,[]
Circular polarimetry of suspect wind-accreting magnetic pre-polars,"We present results from a circular polarimetric survey of candidate detached magnetic white dwarf - M dwarf binaries obtained using the Nordic Optical Telescope, La Palma. We obtained phase resolved spectropolarimetry and imaging polarimetry of seven systems, five of which show clearly variable circular polarisation. The data indicate that these targets have white dwarfs with magnetic field strengths >80 MG. Our study reveals that cyclotron emission can dominate the optical luminosity at wavelengths corresponding to the cyclotron emission harmonics, even in systems where the white dwarfs are only wind-accreting. This implies that a very significant fraction of the stellar wind of the companion star is captured by the magnetic white dwarf reducing the magnetic braking in pre-cataclysmic variables (CVs). Furthermore, the polarimetric confirmation of several detached, wind-accreting magnetic systems provides observational constraints on the models of magnetic CV evolution and white dwarf magnetic field generation. We also find that the white dwarf magnetic field configuration in at least two of these systems appears to be very complex.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.3858H,[]
Close detached white dwarf + brown dwarf binaries: further evidence for low values of the common envelope efficiency,"Common envelope evolution is a fundamental ingredient in our understanding of the formation of close binary stars containing compact objects that include the progenitors of type Ia supernovae, short gamma-ray bursts, and most stellar gravitational wave sources. To predict the outcome of common envelope evolution, we still rely to a large degree on a simplified energy conservation equation. Unfortunately, this equation contains a theoretically rather poorly constrained efficiency parameter (α<SUB>CE</SUB>) and, even worse, it is unclear if energy sources in addition to orbital energy (such as recombination energy) contribute to the envelope ejection process. In previous works, we reconstructed the evolution of observed populations of post-common envelope binaries (PCEBs) consisting of white dwarfs with main-sequence star companions and found indications that the efficiency is rather small (α<SUB>CE</SUB> ≃ 0.2-0.3) and that extra energy sources are only required in very few cases. Here, we used the same reconstruction tool to investigate the evolutionary history of a sample of observed PCEBs with brown dwarf companions. In contrast to previous works, we found that the evolution of observationally well-characterized PCEBs with brown dwarf companions can be understood assuming a low common envelope efficiency (α<SUB>CE</SUB> = 0.24-0.41), similar to that required to understand PCEBs with main-sequence star companions, and that contributions from recombination energy are not required. We conclude that the vast majority of PCEBs form from common envelope evolution that can be parametrized with a small efficiency and without taking into account additional energy sources.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.3587Z,[]
An Hα survey of the host environments of 77 type IIn supernovae within z < 0.02,"Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are an uncommon and highly heterogeneous class of SN where the SN ejecta interact with pre-existing circumstellar media (CSM). Previous studies have found a mass ladder in terms of the association of the SN location with H α emission and the progenitor masses of SN classes. In this paper, we present the largest environmental study of SNe IIn. We analyse the H α environments of 77 type SNeIIn using continuum subtracted H α images. We use the pixel statistics technique, normalized cumulative ranking (NCR), to associate SN pixels with H α emission. We find that our 77 SNe IIn do not follow the H α emission. This is not consistent with the proposed progenitors of SNe IIn, luminous blue variables (LBVs) as LBVs are high-mass stars that undergo dramatic episodic mass loss. However, a subset of the NCR values follow the H α emission, suggesting a population of high-mass progenitors. This suggests there may be multiple progenitor paths with ~60 per cent having non-zero NCR values with a distribution consistent with high-mass progenitors such as LBVs and ~40 per cent of these SNe not being associated with H α emission. We discuss the possible progenitor routes of SNe IIn, especially for the zero NCR value population. We also investigate the radial distribution of the SNe in their hosts in terms of H α and r'-band flux.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.3564R,[]
Asteroid phase curves using sparse Gaia DR2 data and differential dense light curves,"The amount of sparse asteroid photometry being gathered by both space- and ground-based surveys is growing exponentially. This large volume of data poses a computational challenge owing to both the large amount of information to be processed and the new methods needed to combine data from different sources (e.g. obtained by different techniques, in different bands, and having different random and systematic errors). The main goal of this work is to develop an algorithm capable of merging sparse and dense data sets, both relative and differential, in preparation for asteroid observations originating from, for example, Gaia, TESS, ATLAS, LSST, K2, VISTA, and many other sources. We present a novel method to obtain asteroid phase curves by combining sparse photometry and differential ground-based photometry. In the traditional approach, the latter cannot be used for phase curves. Merging those two data types allows for the extraction of phase-curve information for a growing number of objects. Our method is validated for 26 sample asteroids observed by the Gaia mission.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.3242W,[]
"Pipeline for the Antarctic Survey Telescope 3-3 in Yaoan, Yunnan","AST3-3 is the third robotic facility of the Antarctic Survey Telescopes (AST3) for transient surveys to be deployed at Dome A, Antarctica. Due to the current pandemic, the telescope has been currently deployed at the Yaoan Observation Station in China, starting the commissioning observation and a transient survey. This article presented a fully automatic data processing system for AST3-3 observations. The transient detection pipeline uses state-of-the-art image subtraction techniques optimized for GPU devices. Image reduction and transient photometry are accelerated by concurrent task methods. Our Python-based system allows for transient detection from wide-field data in a real-time and accurate way. A ResNet-based rotational-invariant neural network was employed to classify the transient candidates. As a result, the system enables the auto-generation of transients and their light curves.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022FrASS...9.7100S,[]
pyobs - An Observatory Control System for Robotic Telescopes,"We present a Python-based framework for the complete operation of a robotic telescope observatory. It provides out-of-the-box support for many popular camera types while other hardware like telescopes, domes, and weather stations can easily be added via a thin abstraction layer to existing code. Common functionality like focusing, acquisition, auto-guiding, sky-flat acquisition, and pipeline calibration are ready for use. A remote-control interface, a ""mastermind"" for truly robotic operations as well as an interface to the Las Cumbres Observatory observation portal is included. The whole system is fully configurable and easily extendable. We are currently running pyobs successfully on three different types of telescopes, of which one is a siderostat for observing the Sun. pyobs uses open standards and open software wherever possible and is itself freely available.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022FrASS...9.1486H,[]
Ultra-short period contact binaries: restricting the parameters of the primary using Gaia parallax,"Possible M-type contact binaries were investigated by selecting W UMa-type variables with orbital periods below the 0.22-day cutoff. Gaia parallaxes were combined with Gaia and 2MASS photometry to obtain G and J-band absolute magnitudes of 674 red variable stars catalogued as contact binaries in the VSX database. The absolute magnitude of main sequence cool dwarfs varies strongly with spectral type, which was used to create a selection of 218 systems with primaries potentially of spectral types M0-M3. Lightcurves of the 46 systems with lowest near-infrared luminosities were inspected individually to confirm or reject the W UMa classification where possible. The extinction limits and amplitudes were combined with the calculated absolute magnitudes in order to set upper limits for the masses of the primary components. This is achieved via the consideration that the luminosity of the primary is no less than that of a main sequence star of the same mass. For 26 possible contact binaries the mass of the primary was limited to less than 0.5 solar masses with some systems having upper limits for the primary as low as 0.35 solar masses. These rare systems are intriguing targets for more detailed observations since they are on the low-mass end of the contact binary distribution and their formation and evolution are still unclear.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022BlgAJ..37...46K,[]
Search for Pre-Burst Emission from Binary Neutron Star Mergers with Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma,"Close binary systems consisting of two neutron stars (BNS) emit gravitational waves, that allow them to merge on timescales shorter than Hubble time. It is widely believed, that NS-NS mergers in such systems power short gamma-ray bursts (GRB). Several mechanisms which could lead to electromagnetic energy release prior to a merger have been proposed. We estimate the ability to observe the possible pre-burst emission with telescopes of Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma. We also investigate first such event, GRB210919A, which fell into the field of view of the SRG telescopes less than two days before the burst.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AstL...48..370M,[]
Realistic Detection and Early Warning of Binary Neutron Stars with Decihertz Gravitational-wave Observatories,"We investigated the detection rates and early-warning parameters of binary neutron star (BNS) populations with decihertz gravitational-wave observatories in a realistic detecting strategy. Assuming the operation time of B-DECIGO is 4 yr, we classified the detectable BNSs based on parameter precision into three categories: (a) sources that merge within 1 yr, which could be localized with an uncertainty of ΔΩ ~ 10<SUP>0</SUP> deg<SUP>2</SUP>; (b) sources that merge in 1-4 yr, which take up three-quarters of the total events and yield the most precise angular resolution with ΔΩ ~ 10<SUP>-2</SUP> deg<SUP>2</SUP> and time-of-merger accuracy with Δt <SUB> c </SUB> ~ 10<SUP>-1</SUP> s; and (c) sources that do not merge during the 4 yr mission window, which enable possible early warnings, with ΔΩ ~ 10<SUP>-1</SUP> deg<SUP>2</SUP> and Δt <SUB> c </SUB> ~ 10<SUP>0</SUP> s. Furthermore, we compared the pros and cons of B-DECIGO with the third-generation ground-based detectors, and explored the prospects of detections using three other decihertz observatories and four BNS population models. In realistic observing scenarios, we found that decihertz detectors could even provide early-warning alerts to a source decades before its merger while their localizations are still as accurate as ground-based facilities. Finally we found a decrease of events when considering the confusion noise, but this could be partially solved by a proper noise subtraction.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...934...84L,[]
Models of Millimeter and Radio Emission from Interacting Supernovae,"This work utilizes established models of synchrotron-powered light curves for core-collapse supernovae in dense circumstellar environments, namely, type IIn and Ibn, to demonstrate the potential for detecting millimeter emission from these events. The progenitor types of these supernovae are still an open question, but using the synchrotron light curves as probes for the circumstellar environments could shed light on the mass-loss histories of the progenitors and discern between different theories. Observations in millimeter bands are particularly fruitful, as they probe regions at smaller radii and higher ambient densities, where centimeter emission tends to be self-absorbed. In our application of these light curves, we explore a diversity of progenitor types and mass-loss profiles to understand their effects on the light-curve shapes. Additionally, we fit model parameters to the 8 GHz light curve of type IIn supernova 2006jd and then create millimeter light curves using these parameters to show the possibility of detecting an early millimeter peak from such an event. We predict that next generation millimeter surveys will possess the capability to detect nearby and extreme events. However, there is a pressing need for millimeter follow-up of optically discovered interacting supernovae to more completely sample the true population.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...934....5Y,[]
MUSSES2020J: The Earliest Discovery of a Fast Blue Ultraluminous Transient at Redshift 1.063,"In this Letter, we report the discovery of an ultraluminous fast-evolving transient in rest-frame UV wavelengths, MUSSES2020J, soon after its occurrence by using the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) mounted on the 8.2 m Subaru telescope. The rise time of about 5 days with an extremely high UV peak luminosity shares similarities to a handful of fast blue optical transients whose peak luminosities are comparable with the most luminous supernovae while their timescales are significantly shorter (hereafter ""fast blue ultraluminous transient,"" FBUT). In addition, MUSSES2020J is located near the center of a normal low-mass galaxy at a redshift of 1.063, suggesting a possible connection between the energy source of MUSSES2020J and the central part of the host galaxy. Possible physical mechanisms powering this extreme transient such as a wind-driven tidal disruption event and an interaction between supernova and circumstellar material are qualitatively discussed based on the first multiband early-phase light curve of FBUTs, although whether the scenarios can quantitatively explain the early photometric behavior of MUSSES2020J requires systematical theoretical investigations. Thanks to the ultrahigh luminosity in UV and blue optical wavelengths of these extreme transients, a promising number of FBUTs from the local to the high-z universe can be discovered through deep wide-field optical surveys in the near future.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933L..36J,[]
Tidal Disruption on Stellar-mass Black Holes in Active Galactic Nuclei,"Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can funnel stars and stellar remnants from the vicinity of the galactic center into the inner plane of the AGN disk. Stars reaching this inner region can be tidally disrupted by the stellar-mass black holes in the disk. Such micro tidal disruption events (micro-TDEs) could be a useful probe of stellar interaction with the AGN disk. We find that micro-TDEs in AGNs occur at a rate of ~170 Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Their cleanest observational probe may be the electromagnetic detection of tidal disruption in AGNs by heavy supermassive black holes (M <SUB>•</SUB> ≳ 10<SUP>8</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) that cannot tidally disrupt solar-type stars. The reconstructed rate of such events from observations, nonetheless, appears to be much lower than our estimated micro-TDE rate. We discuss two such micro-TDE candidates observed to date (ASASSN-15lh and ZTF19aailpwl).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933L..28Y,[]
Two Candidate KH 15D-like Systems from the Zwicky Transient Facility,"KH 15D contains a circumbinary disk that is tilted relative to the orbital plane of the central binary. The precession of the disk and the orbital motion of the binary together produce rich phenomena in the photometric light curve. In this work, we present the discovery and preliminary analysis of two objects that resemble the key features of KH 15D from the Zwicky Transient Facility. These new objects, Bernhard-1 and Bernhard-2, show large-amplitude ( >1.5 mag), long-duration (more than tens of days), and periodic dimming events. A one-sided screen model is developed to model the photometric behavior of these objects, the physical interpretation of which is a tilted, warped circumbinary disk occulting the inner binary. Changes in the object light curves suggest potential precession periods over timescales longer than 10 yr. Additional photometric and spectroscopic observations are encouraged to better understand the nature of these interesting systems.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933L..21Z,[]
Hubble Space Telescope Observations of Active Asteroid P/2020 O1 (Lemmon-PANSTARRS),"We present Hubble Space Telescope observations of active asteroid P/2020 O1 taken to examine its development for a year after perihelion. We find that the mass loss peaks at ≲1 kg s<SUP>-1</SUP> in 2020 August and then declines to nearly zero over four months. Long-duration mass loss (~180 days) is consistent with a sublimation origin, indicating that this object is likely an ice-bearing main-belt comet. Equilibrium sublimation of water ice from an area as small as 1580 m<SUP>2</SUP> can supply the observed mass loss. Time-series photometry shows tentative evidence for extremely rapid rotation (double-peaked period <2 hr) of the small nucleus (effective radius ~420 m). Ejection velocities of 0.1 mm particles are comparable to the 0.3 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> gravitational escape speed from the nucleus, while larger particles are ejected at speeds less than the escape velocity. These properties are consistent with the sublimation of near-surface ice aided by centripetal acceleration. If water-ice sublimation is confirmed, P/2020 O1 would be an icy asteroid with the smallest semimajor axis (highest temperature), setting new bounds on the distribution of ice in the asteroid belt.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933L..15K,[]
Hydrodynamics of Collisions and Close Encounters between Stellar Black Holes and Main-sequence Stars,"Recent analyses have shown that close encounters between stars and stellar black holes occur frequently in dense star clusters. Depending upon the distance at closest approach, these interactions can lead to dissipating encounters such as tidal captures and disruptions, or direct physical collisions, all of which may be accompanied by bright electromagnetic transients. In this study, we perform a wide range of hydrodynamic simulations of close encounters between black holes and main-sequence stars that collectively cover the parameter space of interest, and we identify and classify the various possible outcomes. In the case of nearly head-on collisions, the star is completely disrupted with roughly half of the stellar material becoming bound to the black hole. For more distant encounters near the classical tidal-disruption radius, the star is only partially disrupted on the first pericenter passage. Depending upon the interaction details, the partially disrupted stellar remnant may be tidally captured by the black hole or become unbound (in some cases, receiving a sufficiently large impulsive kick from asymmetric mass loss to be ejected from its host cluster). In the former case, the star will undergo additional pericenter passages before ultimately being disrupted fully. Based on the properties of the material bound to the black hole at the end of our simulations (in particular, the total bound mass and angular momentum), we comment upon the expected accretion process and associated electromagnetic signatures that are likely to result.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933..203K,[]
Investigating the Nature of the Luminous Ambiguous Nuclear Transient ASASSN-17jz,"We present observations of the extremely luminous but ambiguous nuclear transient (ANT) ASASSN-17jz, spanning roughly 1200 days of the object's evolution. ASASSN-17jz was discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) in the galaxy SDSS J171955.84+414049.4 on UT 2017 July 27 at a redshift of z = 0.1641. The transient peaked at an absolute B-band magnitude of M <SUB> B,peak</SUB> = -22.81, corresponding to a bolometric luminosity of L <SUB>bol,peak</SUB> = 8.3 × 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, and exhibited late-time ultraviolet emission that was still ongoing in our latest observations. Integrating the full light curve gives a total emitted energy of E <SUB>tot</SUB> = (1.36 ±0.08) × 10<SUP>52</SUP> erg, with (0.80 ± 0.02) × 10<SUP>52</SUP> erg of this emitted within 200 days of peak light. This late-time ultraviolet emission is accompanied by increasing X-ray emission that becomes softer as it brightens. ASASSN-17jz exhibited a large number of spectral emission lines most commonly seen in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with little evidence of evolution. It also showed transient Balmer features, which became fainter and broader over time, and are still being detected >1000 days after peak brightness. We consider various physical scenarios for the origin of the transient, including supernovae (SNe), tidal disruption events, AGN outbursts, and ANTs. We find that the most likely explanation is that ASASSN-17jz was a SN IIn occurring in or near the disk of an existing AGN, and that the late-time emission is caused by the AGN transitioning to a more active state.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933..196H,[]
A Long-period Pre-ELM System Discovered from the LAMOST Medium-resolution Survey,"We present LAMOST J041920.07+072545.4 (hereafter J0419), a close binary consisting of a bloated, extremely low mass pre-white dwarf (pre-ELM WD) and a compact object with an orbital period of 0.607189 days. The large-amplitude ellipsoidal variations and the evident Balmer and He I emission lines suggest a filled Roche lobe and ongoing mass transfer. No outburst events were detected in the 15 years of monitoring of J0419, indicating a very low mass transfer rate. The temperature of the pre-ELM, ${T}_{\mathrm{eff}}={5793}_{-133}^{+124}\,{\rm{K}}$ , makes it cooler than the known ELMs, but hotter than most cataclysmic variable donors. Combining the mean density within the Roche lobe and the radius constrained from our spectral energy distribution fitting, we obtain the mass of the pre-ELM, M <SUB>1</SUB> = 0.176 ± 0.014 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The joint fitting of light and radial velocity curves yields an inclination angle of $i={66.5}_{-1.7}^{+1.4}$ degrees, corresponding to a mass of the compact object of M <SUB>2</SUB> = 1.09 ± 0.05 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The very bloated pre-ELM has a smaller surface gravity ( $\mathrm{log}g=3.9\pm 0.01$ , R <SUB>1</SUB> = 0.78 ± 0.02 R <SUB>⊙</SUB>) than the known ELMs or pre-ELMs. The temperature and the luminosity ( ${L}_{\mathrm{bol}}={0.62}_{-0.10}^{+0.11}\,{L}_{\odot }$ ) of J0419 are close to those of the main sequence, which makes the selection of such systems through the H-R diagram inefficient. Based on the evolutionary model, the relatively long period and small $\mathrm{log}g$ indicate that J0419 could be close to the ""bifurcation period"" in the orbital evolution, which makes J0419 a unique source to connect ELM/pre-ELM WD systems, wide binaries, and cataclysmic variables.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933..193Z,[]
The Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey: Changing-look Quasar Candidates from Multi-epoch Spectroscopy in SDSS-IV,"Active galactic nuclei (AGN) can vary significantly in their rest-frame optical/UV continuum emission, and with strong associated changes in broad line emission, on much shorter timescales than predicted by standard models of accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Most such changing-look or changing-state AGN-and at higher luminosities, changing-look quasars (CLQs)-have been found via spectroscopic follow-up of known quasars showing strong photometric variability. The Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) includes repeat spectroscopy of large numbers of previously known quasars, many selected irrespective of photometric variability, and with spectral epochs separated by months to decades. Our visual examination of these repeat spectra for strong broad line variability yielded 61 newly discovered CLQ candidates. We quantitatively compare spectral epochs to measure changes in continuum and Hβ broad line emission, finding 19 CLQs, of which 15 are newly recognized. The parent sample includes only broad line quasars, so our study tends to find objects that have dimmed, i.e., turn-off CLQs. However, we nevertheless find four turn-on CLQs that meet our criteria, albeit with broad lines in both dim and bright states. We study the response of Hβ and Mg II emission lines to continuum changes. The Eddington ratios of CLQs are low, and/or their Hβ broad line width is large relative to the overall quasar population. Repeat quasar spectroscopy in the upcoming SDSS-V black hole Mapper program will reveal significant numbers of CLQs, enhancing our understanding of the frequency and duty cycle of such strong variability, and the physics and dynamics of the phenomenon.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933..180G,[]
A Late-time Radio Flare Following a Possible Transition in Accretion State in the Tidal Disruption Event AT 2019azh,"We report here radio follow-up observations of the optical tidal disruption event (TDE) AT 2019azh. Previously reported X-ray observations of this TDE showed variability at early times and a dramatic increase in luminosity, by a factor of ~10, about 8 months after optical discovery. The X-ray emission is mainly dominated by intermediate hard-soft X-rays and is exceptionally soft around the X-ray peak, which is L <SUB> X </SUB> ~ 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The high cadence 15.5 GHz observations reported here show an early rise in radio emission followed by an approximately constant light curve, and a late-time flare. This flare starts roughly at the time of the observed X-ray peak luminosity and reaches its peak about 110 days after the peak in the X-ray, and a year after optical discovery. The radio flare peaks at ν L <SUB> ν </SUB> ~ 10<SUP>38</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, a factor of two higher than the emission preceding the flare. In light of the late-time radio and X-ray flares, and the X-ray spectral evolution, we speculate a possible transition in the accretion state of this TDE, similar to the observed behavior in black hole X-ray binaries. We compare the radio properties of AT 2019azh to other known TDEs, and focus on the similarities to the late-time radio flare of the TDE ASASSN-15oi.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933..176S,[]
Photometry on Structured Backgrounds: Local Pixel-wise Infilling by Regression,"Photometric pipelines struggle to estimate both the flux and flux uncertainty for stars in the presence of structured backgrounds such as filaments or clouds. However, it is exactly stars in these complex regions that are critical to understanding star formation and the structure of the interstellar medium. We develop a method, similar to Gaussian process regression, which we term local pixel-wise infilling (LPI). Using a local covariance estimate, we predict the background behind each star and the uncertainty of that prediction in order to improve estimates of flux and flux uncertainty. We show the validity of our model on synthetic data and real dust fields. We further demonstrate that the method is stable even in the crowded field limit. While we focus on optical-IR photometry, this method is not restricted to those wavelengths. We apply this technique to the 34 billion detections in the second data release of the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey. In addition to removing many >3σ outliers and improving uncertainty estimates by a factor of ~2-3 on nebulous fields, we also show that our method is well behaved on uncrowded fields. The entirely post-processing nature of our implementation of LPI photometry allows it to easily improve the flux and flux uncertainty estimates of past as well as future surveys.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933..155S,[]
Mass-ratio Distribution of Binaries from the LAMOST-MRS Survey,"Binary evolution leads to the formation of important objects that are crucial for the development of astrophysics, but the statistical properties of binary populations are still poorly understood. The LAMOST-MRS has provided a large sample of stars to study the properties of binary populations, especially for the mass-ratio distributions and binary fractions. We have devised a peak amplitude ratio (PAR) approach to derive the mass ratio of a binary system based on results obtained from its spectrum. By computing a cross-correlation function, we established a relation between the derived mass ratio and the PARs of the binary systems. By using spectral observations obtained from LAMSOT DR6 and DR7, we applied the PAR approach to form distributions of the derived mass ratio of the binary systems to the spectral types. We selected the mass ratio within the range of 0.6-1.0 to investigate the mass-ratio distribution. Through a power-law fitting, we obtained power index γ values of -0.42 ± 0.27, 0.03 ± 0.12, and 2.12 ± 0.19 for the A-, F-, and G-type stars identified in the sample, respectively. The derived γ-values display an increasing trend toward lower primary star masses, and G-type binaries tend to be twins more frequently. The close binary fractions (for P ≲ 150 days and q ≳ 0.6) in our sample for A, F, and G binaries are 7.6% ± 0.5%, 4.9% ± 0.2%, and 3.7% ± 0.1%, respectively. Note that the PAR approach can be applied to large spectroscopic surveys of stars.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933..119L,[]
Variable Active Galactic Nuclei in the Galaxy Evolution Explorer Time Domain Survey,"We searched the northern hemisphere fields of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer Time Domain Survey for galaxies with UV variability indicative of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We identified 48 high-probability candidate AGNs from a parent sample of 1819 galaxies in the NASA Sloan Atlas catalog. We further characterized these systems using optical spectroscopic diagnostics, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer IR color selection criteria, and spectral energy distribution modeling. Of the 48 candidates, eight were identified as AGNs from optical emission lines, two were identified by their IR colors, and 28 were identified through spectral energy decomposition. Observational biases of each selection method are discussed in connecting these AGN subsamples to another. By selecting AGNs based on UV variability, we also identified six low-mass AGN candidates, all of which would have been missed by spectroscopic selection.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933...37W,[]
A Library of Synthetic X-Ray Spectra for Fitting Tidal Disruption Events,"We present a tabulated version of our slim-disk model for fitting tidal disruption events (TDEs). We create a synthetic X-ray spectral library by ray-tracing stationary general relativistic slim disks and including gravitational redshift, Doppler, and lensing effects self-consistently. We introduce the library to reduce computational expense and increase access for fitting future events. Fitting requires interpolation between the library spectra; the interpolation error in the synthetic flux is generally <10% (it can rise to 40% when the disk is nearly edge-on). We fit the X-ray spectra of the TDEs ASASSN-14li and ASASSN-15oi, successfully reproducing our earlier constraints on black hole mass M <SUB>•</SUB> and spin a <SUB>•</SUB> from full on-the-fly ray-tracing. We use the library to fit mock observational data to explore the degeneracies among parameters, finding that (1) spectra from a hotter thermal disk and edge-on inclination angle offer tighter constraints on M <SUB>•</SUB> and a <SUB>•</SUB>; (2) the constraining power of spectra on M <SUB>•</SUB> and a <SUB>•</SUB> increases as a power law with the number of X-ray counts, and the index of the power law is higher for hotter thermal disk spectra; (3) multiepoch X-ray spectra partially break the degeneracy between M <SUB>•</SUB> and a <SUB>•</SUB>; (4) the time-dependent level of X-ray absorption can be constrained from spectral fitting.

Bumpy Declining Light Curves Are Common in Hydrogen-poor Superluminous Supernovae,"Recent work has revealed that the light curves of hydrogen-poor (Type I) superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), thought to be powered by magnetar central engines, do not always follow the smooth decline predicted by a simple magnetar spin-down model. Here we present the first systematic study of the prevalence and properties of ""bumps"" in the post-peak light curves of 34 SLSNe. We find that the majority (44%-76%) of events cannot be explained by a smooth magnetar model alone. We do not find any difference in supernova properties between events with and without bumps. By fitting a simple Gaussian model to the light-curve residuals, we characterize each bump with an amplitude, temperature, phase, and duration. We find that most bumps correspond with an increase in the photospheric temperature of the ejecta, although we do not see drastic changes in spectroscopic features during the bump. We also find a moderate correlation (ρ ≈ 0.5; p ≈ 0.01) between the phase of the bumps and the rise time, implying that such bumps tend to happen at a certain ""evolutionary phase,"" (3.7 ± 1.4)t <SUB>rise</SUB>. Most bumps are consistent with having diffused from a central source of variable luminosity, although sources further out in the ejecta are not excluded. With this evidence, we explore whether the cause of these bumps is intrinsic to the supernova (e.g., a variable central engine) or extrinsic (e.g., circumstellar interaction). Both cases are plausible, requiring low-level variability in the magnetar input luminosity, small decreases in the ejecta opacity, or a thin circumstellar shell or disk.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933...14H,[]
An ALMA Search for High-albedo Objects Among the Midsized Jupiter Trojan Population,"We use Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) measurements of 870 μm thermal emission from a sample of midsized (15-40 km diameter) Jupiter Trojan asteroids to search for high-albedo objects in this population. We calculate the diameters and albedos of each object using a thermal model which also incorporates contemporaneous Zwicky Transient Facility photometry to accurately measure the absolute magnitude at the time of the ALMA observation. We find that while many albedos are lower than reported from WISE, several small Trojans have high albedos independently measured both from ALMA and from WISE. The number of these high-albedo objects is approximately consistent with expectations of the number of objects that recently have undergone large-scale impacts, suggesting that the interiors of freshly-crated Jupiter Trojans could contain high-albedo materials such as ices.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164...23S,[]
Transient simulations for radio surveys,"Several new radio facilities have a field of view and sensitivity well suited for transient searches. This makes it more important than ever to accurately determine transient rates in radio surveys. The work presented here seeks to do this task by using Monte-Carlo simulations. In particular, the user inputs either a real or simulated observational setup, and the simulations code calculates transient rate as a function of transient duration and peak flux. These simulations allow for simulating a wide variety of scenarios including observations with varying sensitivities and durations, multiple overlapping telescope pointings, and a wide variety of light curve shapes with the user having the ability to easily add more. While the current scientific focus is on the radio regime, with examples given here from the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, the simulations code can be easily adapted to other wavelength regimes.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&C....4000629C,[]

Methods: Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging is the only method that offers milli-arcsecond-level high resolution that can exclude the contamination by diffuse emission on galactic scales. We observed J1430+2303 with the European VLBI Network at 1.7 GHz and with the Very Long Baseline Array at 1.6 and 4.9 GHz in late February and early March 2022.,,,[]
"Results: A compact component is detected in all three VLBI images. It has a brightness temperature of > 10<SUP>8</SUP> K, an unresolved morphology with a size < 0.8 pc, and a flat radio spectrum. These observational features are inconsistent with large opening-angle outflows or winds, but indicate that this compact component might be a jet or a corona. Nearly 60% of the emission is resolved by VLBI and may come from remnant lobes of previous radio activities, the outer layers of a structured jet, or shocks formed by the disc winds in the narrow line region.",,,[]
"Conclusions: Current VLBI images do not yet show signs of radio outbursts. Our observations provide pre-coalescence radio data that are an important reference for future comparative studies with the post-merger. In particular, further resolving the jet will pave the way for probing the dynamical features associated with inspiralling binary black holes.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...663A.139A,,[]
The 2175 Å bump features in FeLoBAL quasars: One indicator of MW-like dust in the nuclear region of quasars,"To investigate the properties of dust in the nuclear region of quasars, we explored the extinction curves of the iron low-ionisation broad absorption line (FeLoBAL) quasar SDSS J163004.29+311957.6 and its two analogues. The parametrised extinction curves indicated the Milky Way-like 2175 Å bump features in underlying extinction, which are similar to those seen in the Local Group and in a subset of high-redshift star-forming galaxies. Compared to the bump features in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the detections in this work are much closer to those in the Milky Way (MW). These bump features, as well as those in the high- and low-ionisation broad absorption line (BAL) quasars with 2175 Å bumps, are probably the counterpart of the 2175 Å bump features in the quasar environment. This type of dust grain is generally small, easily disrupted by high-energy photons, and has difficulty surviving in the radiation field of the active galactic nucleus. However, due to the presence of absorption-line outflows, the 2175 Å bump feature in quasars, which should be rare, is seen many times in BAL quasars. The shielding effect of outflow clouds allows the MW-like dust grains to be assembled or extends the survival period in the quasar nuclear region. The process and physical and chemical conditions deserve further observational study and investigation.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...663A..63Z,[]
HD 133729: A blue large-amplitude pulsator in orbit around a main-sequence B-type star,"Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) form a small group of hot objects pulsating in a fundamental radial mode with periods of the order of 30 min. Proposed evolutionary scenarios explain them as evolved low-mass stars: ∼0.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> shell-hydrogen-burning objects with a degenerated helium core, more massive (0.5-0.8) M<SUB>⊙</SUB> core-helium-burning stars, or ∼0.7 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> surviving companions of type Ia supernovae. Therefore, their origin remains to be established. Using data from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we discovered that HD 133729 is a binary consisting of a late B-type main-sequence star and a BLAP. The BLAP pulsates with a period of 32.37 min decreasing at a rate of ( − 7.11 ± 0.33) × 10<SUP>−11</SUP>. The light curve is typical for BLAPs, but it shows an unusual 40-s drop at the descending branch. Due to light dilution by a brighter companion, the observed amplitude of pulsation is much smaller than in other BLAPs. From available photometry, we derived times of maximum light, which revealed the binary nature of the star via an O−C diagram. The diagram shows variations with a period of 23.08433 d that we attribute to the light-travel-time effect in the system. The analysis of these variations allowed us to derive the spectroscopic parameters of the BLAP's orbit around the binary's centre of mass. The presence of a hot companion in the system was confirmed by the analysis of its spectral energy distribution, which was also used to place the components in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The obtained position of the BLAP fully agrees with the location of the other members of the class. With the estimated V ≈ 11 mag and the Gaia distance of less than 0.5 kpc, the BLAP is the brightest and the nearest of all known BLAPs. It may become a key object in the verification of the evolutionary scenarios for this class of variables. We argue that low-mass progenitors of the BLAP are excluded if the components are coeval and no mass transfer between the components took place.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...663A..62P,[]
Fink: Early supernovae Ia classification using active learning,"Context. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will produce a continuous stream of alerts made of varying sources in the sky. This data flow will be publicly advertised and distributed to scientists via broker systems such as FINK, whose task is to extract scientific information from the stream. Given the complexity and volume of the data to be generated, LSST is a prime target for machine learning (ML) techniques. One of the most challenging stages of this task is the construction of appropriate training samples which enable learning based on a limited number of spectroscopically confirmed objects.",,[]
Aims: We describe how the FINK broker early supernova Ia (SN Ia) classifier optimizes its ML classifications by employing an active learning (AL) strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility of implementing such strategies in the current Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public alert data stream.,,,[]
"Methods: We compared the performance of two AL strategies: uncertainty sampling and random sampling. Our pipeline consists of three stages: feature extraction, classification, and learning strategy. Starting from an initial sample of ten alerts, including five SNe Ia and five non-Ia, we let the algorithm identify which alert should be added to the training sample. The system was allowed to evolve through 300 iterations.",,,[]
"Results: Our data set consists of 23 840 alerts from ZTF with a confirmed classification via a crossmatch with the SIMBAD database and the Transient Name Server (TNS), 1600 of which were SNe Ia (1021 unique objects). After the learning cycle was completed, the data configuration consisted of 310 alerts for training and 23 530 for testing. Averaging over 100 realizations, the classifier achieved ~89% purity and ~54% efficiency. From 01 November 2020 to 31 October 2021 FINK applied its early SN Ia module to the ZTF stream and communicated promising SN Ia candidates to the TNS. From the 535 spectroscopically classified FINK candidates, 459 (86%) were proven to be SNe Ia.",,,[]
"Conclusions: Our results confirm the effectiveness of AL strategies for guiding the construction of optimal training samples for astronomical classifiers. It demonstrates in real data that the performance of learning algorithms can be highly improved without the need of extra computational resources or overwhelmingly large training samples. This is, to our knowledge, the first application of AL to real alert data.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...663A..13L,,[]
TUVOpipe: A pipeline to search for UV transients with Swift-UVOT,"Despite the prevalence of transient-searching facilities operating across most wavelengths, the ultraviolet (UV) transient sky remains to be systematically studied. Therefore, we recently initiated the Transient Ultraviolet Objects (TUVO) project, with which we search for serendipitous UV transients in data obtained using currently available UV instruments with a strong focus on the UV and Optical (UVOT) telescope aboard the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (an overview of the project is described in a companion paper). Here, we describe the pipeline (named TUVOpipe) we constructed in order to find such transients in the UVOT data, using difference image analysis. The pipeline is run daily on all new public UVOT data (which are available 6-8 h after the observations are performed), so we discover transients in near real time. Transients that last >0.5 days are therefore still active when discovered, allowing for follow-up observations to be performed. From 01 October 2020 to the time of submission, we used the TUVOpipe to process 75 183 individual UVOT images, and we currently detect an average rate of ~100 transient candidates per day. Of these daily candidates, on average ~30% are real transients (separated by human vetting from the remaining ""bogus"" transients which were not discarded automatically within the pipeline). Most of the real transients correspond to known variable stars, though we also detect a significant number of known active galactic nuclei and accreting white dwarfs. The TUVOpipe can additionally run in archival mode, whereby all the archival UVOT data of a given field is scoured for `historical' transients; in this mode, we also mostly find variable stars. However, some of the transients we find (in particular in the real-time mode) represent previously unreported new transients or undiscovered outbursts of previously known transients, predominantly outbursts from cataclysmic variables. In this paper, we describe the operation of (both modes of) TUVOpipe and some of the initial results we have obtained so far.",,[]

Candidate Tidal Disruption Event AT2019fdr Coincident with a High-Energy Neutrino,"The origins of the high-energy cosmic neutrino flux remain largely unknown. Recently, one high-energy neutrino was associated with a tidal disruption event (TDE). Here we present AT2019fdr, an exceptionally luminous TDE candidate, coincident with another high-energy neutrino. Our observations, including a bright dust echo and soft late-time x-ray emission, further support a TDE origin of this flare. The probability of finding two such bright events by chance is just 0.034%. We evaluate several models for neutrino production and show that AT2019fdr is capable of producing the observed high-energy neutrino, reinforcing the case for TDEs as neutrino sources.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PhRvL.128v1101R,[]
Laboratory and On-sky Testing of an InGaAs Detector for Infrared Imaging,"We describe the results of testing a shortwave infrared CMOS camera using an indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) detector. The new generation of InGaAs detectors offers a cost-effective alternative to mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe) for astronomy research, with current, off-the-shelf cameras requiring no modification before use. Testing was conducted in the laboratory and on-sky while mounted to the robotic, 2 m Liverpool Telescope using a H-band filter. The camera exhibits a dark current of 821 e<SUP>-</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> pix<SUP>-1</SUP> and a bias level of 864 e<SUP>-</SUP> pix<SUP>-1</SUP>. The dark current associated shot noise is of similar size to the read noise of 32 e<SUP>-</SUP> pix<SUP>-1</SUP> in one-second exposures. Linearity within the count region where readout noise and bit-depth saturation effects are not dominant is within a few tenths of a per cent. After field-compression by fore optics, the plate-scale yields 0.″3 pix<SUP>-1</SUP>, near perfect for Nyquist sampling at the La Palma site. The sky background for the H-band filter dominates the other noise sources for the instrument for one-second exposures producing sky-limited photometry. On-sky observations show that milli-magnitude precision is achieved for sources <10.7 mag and a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 is achievable for 16th magnitude with a 3 minutes total exposure time, making it an ideal follow-up instrument for sources detected in current and upcoming IR surveys.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134f5001B,[]
Confirming new changing-look AGNs discovered through optical variability using a random forest-based light-curve classifier,"Determining the frequency and duration of changing-look (CL) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) phenomena, where the optical broad emission lines appear or disappear, is crucial to understand the evolution of the accretion flow around supermassive black holes. We present a strategy to select new CL candidates starting from a spectroscopic type 2 AGN sample and searching for current type 1 photometric variability. We use the publicly available Zwicky Transient Facility alert stream and the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events light-curve classifier to produce a list of CL candidates with a highly automated algorithm, resulting in 60 candidates. Visual inspection reduced the sample to 30. We performed new spectroscopic observations of six candidates of our clean sample, without further refinement, finding the appearance of clear broad Balmer lines in four of them and tentative evidence of type changes in the remaining two, which suggests a promising success rate of ≥66 per cent for this CL selection method.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513L..57L,[]
Characterizing eclipsing white dwarf M dwarf binaries from multiband eclipse photometry,"With the prevalence of wide-field, time-domain photometric sky surveys, the number of eclipsing white dwarf (WD) systems being discovered is increasing dramatically. An efficient method to follow these up will be key to determining any population trends and finding any particularly interesting examples. We demonstrate that multiband eclipse photometry of binaries containing a WD and an M dwarf can be used to determine the masses and temperatures of the WDs to better than 5 per cent. For the M dwarfs, we measure their parameters to a precision of better than 6 per cent with the uncertainty dominated by the intrinsic scatter of the M dwarf mass-radius relationship. This precision is better than what can typically be achieved with low-resolution spectroscopy. The nature of this method means that it will be applicable to LSST data in the future, enabling direct characterization without follow-up spectroscopy. Additionally, we characterize three new post-common-envelope binaries from their eclipse photometry, finding two systems containing hot helium-core WDs with low-mass companions (one near the brown dwarf transition regime) and a possible detached cataclysmic variable at the lower edge of the period gap.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.3050B,[]
The detection efficiency of Type Ia supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility: limits on the intrinsic rate of early flux excesses,"Samples of young Type Ia supernovae have shown 'early excess' emission in a few cases. Similar excesses are predicted by some explosion and progenitor scenarios and hence can provide important clues regarding the origin of thermonuclear supernovae. They are, however, only predicted to last up to the first few days following explosion. It is therefore unclear whether such scenarios are intrinsically rare or whether the relatively small sample size simply reflects the difficulty in obtaining sufficiently early detections. To that end, we perform toy simulations covering a range of survey depths and cadences, and investigate the efficiency with which young Type Ia supernovae are recovered. As input for our simulations, we use models that broadly cover the range of predicted luminosities. Based on our simulations, we find that in a typical 3 d cadence survey, only ~10 per cent of Type Ia supernovae would be detected early enough to rule out the presence of an excess. A 2 d cadence, however, should see this increase to ~15 per cent. We find comparable results from more detailed simulations of the Zwicky Transient Facility surveys. Using the recovery efficiencies from these detailed simulations, we investigate the number of young Type Ia supernovae expected to be discovered assuming some fraction of the population comes from scenarios producing an excess at early times. Comparing the results of our simulations to observations, we find that the intrinsic fraction of Type Ia supernovae with early flux excesses is $\sim 28^{+13}_{-11}{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.3035M,[]
The long-active afterglow of GRB 210204A: detection of the most delayed flares in a gamma-ray burst,"We present results from extensive broadband follow-up of GRB 210204A over the period of 30 d. We detect optical flares in the afterglow at 7.6 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> s and 1.1 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> s after the burst: the most delayed flaring ever detected in a GRB afterglow. At the source redshift of 0.876, the rest-frame delay is 5.8 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> s (6.71 d). We investigate possible causes for this flaring and conclude that the most likely cause is a refreshed shock in the jet. The prompt emission of the GRB is within the range of typical long bursts: it shows three disjoint emission episodes, which all follow the typical GRB correlations. This suggests that GRB 210204A might not have any special properties that caused late-time flaring, and the lack of such detections for other afterglows might be resulting from the paucity of late-time observations. Systematic late-time follow-up of a larger sample of GRBs can shed more light on such afterglow behaviour. Further analysis of the GRB 210204A shows that the late-time bump in the light curve is highly unlikely due to underlying SNe at redshift (z) = 0.876 and is more likely due to the late-time flaring activity. The cause of this variability is not clearly quantifiable due to the lack of multiband data at late-time constraints by bad weather conditions. The flare of GRB 210204A is the latest flare detected to date.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.2777K,[]
The prospects of finding tidal disruption events with 2.5-m Wide-Field Survey Telescope based on mock observations,"Optical time-domain surveys have been the dominant means of hunting for rare tidal disruption events (TDEs) in the past decade and remarkably advanced the TDE study. Particularly, the Zwicky Transient Facility has opened the era of population studies, and the upcoming Large Survey of Space and Time at the Vera Rubin Observatory is believed to further revolutionize the field soon. Here, we present the prospects of finding TDEs with another powerful survey to be performed by 2.5-m Wide-Field Survey Telescope (WFST). The WFST, located in western China, will be the most advanced facility dedicated to optical time-domain surveys in the Northern hemisphere once commissioning. We choose to assess its TDE detectability on the basis of mock observations, which is hitherto closest to reality by taking into consideration site conditions, telescope parameters, survey strategy, and transient searching pipeline. Our mock observations on a 440-deg<SUP>2</SUP> field (CosmoDC2 catalogue) show that 29 ± 6 TDEs can be robustly found per year if observed at u, g, r, and i bands with 30-s exposure every 10 days, in which a discovery is defined as ≥10 epochal detections in at least two filters. If the WFST survey is fully optimized for discovering TDEs, we would expect to identify 392 ± 74 TDEs every year, with the redshift up to z ~ 0.8, which poses a huge challenge to follow-up resources.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.2422L,[]
The OmegaWhite survey for short-period variable stars - VII. High amplitude short-period blue variables,"Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) are a relatively new class of blue variable stars showing periodic variations in their light curves with periods shorter than a few tens of minutes and amplitudes of more than 10 per cent. We report nine blue variable stars identified in the OmegaWhite survey conducted using ESO's VST, which shows a periodic modulation in the range 7-37 min and an amplitude in the range 0.11-0.28 mag. We have obtained a series of followup photometric and spectroscopic observations made primarily using SALT and telescopes at SAAO. We find four stars which we identify as BLAPs, one of which was previously known. One star, OW J0820-3301, appears to be a member of the V361 Hya class of pulsating stars and is spatially close to an extended nebula. One further star, OW J1819-2729, has characteristics similar to the sdAV pulsators. In contrast, OW J0815-3421 is a binary star containing an sdB and a white dwarf with an orbital period of 73.7 min, making it only one of six white dwarf-sdB binaries with an orbital period shorter than 80 min. Finally, high cadence photometry of four of the candidate BLAPs show features that we compare with notch-like features seen in the much longer period Cepheid pulsators.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.2215R,[]
A standard siren cosmological measurement from the potential GW190521 electromagnetic counterpart ZTF19abanrhr,"The identification of the electromagnetic (EM) counterpart candidate ZTF19abanrhr to the binary black hole merger GW190521 opens the possibility to infer cosmological parameters from this standard siren with a uniquely identified host galaxy. The distant merger allows for cosmological inference beyond the Hubble constant. Here, we show that the three-dimensional spatial location of ZTF19abanrhr calculated from the EM data remains consistent with the latest sky localization of GW190521 provided by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration. If ZTF19abanrhr is associated with the GW190521 merger, and assuming a flat wCDM model, we find that $H_0=48^{+23}_{-10}\, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, $\Omega _m=0.35^{+0.41}_{-0.26}$, and $w_0=-1.31^{+0.61}_{-0.48}$ (median and $68{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ credible interval). If we use the Hubble constant value inferred from another gravitational-wave event, GW170817, as a prior for our analysis, together with assumption of a flat ΛCDM and the model-independent constraint on the physical matter density ω<SUB>m</SUB> from Planck, we find $H_0=68.9^{+8.7}_{-6.0}\, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.2152C,[]
"Machine learning for fast transients for the Deeper, Wider, Faster programme with the Removal Of BOgus Transients (ROBOT) pipeline","The Deeper, Wider, Faster (DWF) programme is optimized to detect fast transients that show luminosity changes on time-scales of sub-second to days using fast cadence simultaneous observations and rapid response follow up. One of the significant bottlenecks in DWF is the time required to assess candidates for rapid follow up and to manually inspect candidates prior to triggering space-based or large ground-based telescopes. In this paper, we present the Removal Of BOgus Transients (ROBOTs) pipeline that uses a combination of machine learning methods, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Decision Tree (CART), to analyse source quality and to filter in promising candidates. The ROBOT pipeline is optimized for 'lossy' compressed data required by DWF for fast data transfer to find these candidates within minutes of the light hitting the telescopes. Preliminary testing of the ROBOT pipeline on archival data showed to reduce the number of candidates that require a manual inspection from 69 628 to 3327 (a factor of ~21 times), whilst simultaneously sorting candidates into categories of priority, with potential for further improvement. Recent real-time operation of the ROBOT pipeline in DWF-O10 showed to further reduce manual inspections from ~155 000 to ~5000 (a factor of ~31 times).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.1742G,[]
The OmegaWhite survey for short-period variable stars - VI. Open clusters,"Using light curves with ~3 min cadence and a duration of 2 h made using the OmegaWhite survey, we present the results of a search for short-period variable stars in the field of 20 open clusters. We identified 92 variable stars in these fields. Using a range of cluster member catalogues and Gaia EDR3 data, we have determined that 10 are cluster members and 2 more are probable members. Based on their position on the Gaia HRD and their photometric periods, we find that most of these are δ Sct stars. We obtained low-resolution optical spectroscopy of some of these cluster members and field stars. We discuss the cluster variable stars in the context of δ Sct stars in other open clusters.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513..468T,[]
Periodic stellar variability from almost a million NGTS light curves,"We analyse 829 481 stars from the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) to extract variability periods. We utilize a generalization of the autocorrelation function (the G-ACF), which applies to irregularly sampled time series data. We extract variability periods for 16 880 stars from late-A through to mid-M spectral types and periods between ~0.1 and 130 d with no assumed variability model. We find variable signals associated with a number of astrophysical phenomena, including stellar rotation, pulsations, and multiple-star systems. The extracted variability periods are compared with stellar parameters taken from Gaia DR2, which allows us to identify distinct regions of variability in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram. We explore a sample of rotational main-sequence objects in period-colour space, in which we observe a dearth of rotation periods between 15 and 25 d. This 'bi-modality' was previously only seen in space-based data. We demonstrate that stars in sub-samples above and below the period gap appear to arise from a stellar population not significantly contaminated by excess multiple systems. We also observe a small population of long-period variable M-dwarfs, which highlight a departure from the predictions made by rotational evolution models fitted to solar-type main-sequence objects. The NGTS data spans a period and spectral type range that links previous rotation studies such as those using data from Kepler, K2, and MEarth.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513..420B,[]
The SN Ia runaway LP 398-9: detection of circumstellar material and surface rotation,"A promising progenitor scenario for Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) is the thermonuclear detonation of a white dwarf in a close binary system with another white dwarf. After the primary star explodes, the surviving donor can be spontaneously released as a hypervelocity runaway. One such runaway donor candidate is LP 398-9, whose orbital trajectory traces back ≈10<SUP>5</SUP> yr to a known supernova remnant. Here, we report the discovery of carbon-rich circumstellar material around LP 398-9, revealed by a strong infrared excess and analysed with follow-up spectroscopy. The circumstellar material is most plausibly composed of inflated layers from the star itself, mechanically and radioactively heated by the past companion's supernova. We also detect a 15.4 h periodic signal in the UV and optical light curves of LP 398-9, which we interpret as surface rotation. The rotation rate is consistent with theoretical predictions from this supernova mechanism, and the brightness variations could originate from surface inhomogeneity deposited by the supernova itself. Our observations strengthen the case for this double-degenerate SNIa progenitor channel, and motivate the search for more runaway SNIa donors.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.6122C,[]
"A step towards unveiling the nature of three cataclysmic variables: LS Cam, V902 Mon, and SWIFT J0746.3-1608","We have carried out detailed time-resolved timing analyses of three cataclysmic variables (CVs) namely LS Cam, V902 Mon, and SWIFT J0746.3-1608, using the long-baseline, high-cadence optical photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. Our analysis of LS Cam observations hints the presence of a superorbital period of ~4.025 ± 0.007 d along with negative and positive superhump periods of ~3.30 and 3.70 h, respectively. These results can be explained as an interaction of nodal and apsidal precession of the accretion disc with orbital motion. For the other two sources, V902 Mon and SWIFT J0746.3-1608, we have found evidence of a beat period of 2387.0 ± 0.6 and 2409.5 ± 0.7 s, respectively, which were not found in earlier studies. Our results presented in this study indicate the change in the accretion mode during the entire observing period for both sources. For V902 Mon, an apparent orbital period derivative of (6.09 ± 0.60) × 10<SUP>-10</SUP> was also found. Moreover, the second harmonic of orbital frequency dominates the power spectrum of SWIFT J0746.3-1608, suggestive of ellipsoidal modulation of the secondary star. Present analyses suggest that LS Cam could be a superhumping CV, whereas V902 Mon and SWIFT J0746.3-1608 are likely to be variable disc-overflow accreting intermediate polars.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.6054R,[]
Unicorns and giraffes in the binary zoo: stripped giants with subgiant companions,"We analyse two binary systems containing giant stars, V723 Mon ('the Unicorn') and 2M04123153+6738486 ('the Giraffe'). Both giants orbit more massive but less luminous companions, previously proposed to be mass-gap black holes. Spectral disentangling reveals luminous companions with star-like spectra in both systems. Joint modelling of the spectra, light curves, and spectral energy distributions robustly constrains the masses, temperatures, and radii of both components: the primaries are luminous, cool giants ($T_{\rm eff,\, giant} = 3800$ and $4000\, \rm K$, $R_{\rm giant}= 22.5$ and $25\, {\rm R}_{\odot }$) with exceptionally low masses ($M_{\rm giant} \approx 0.4\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$) that likely fill their Roche lobes. The secondaries are only slightly warmer subgiants ($T_{\rm eff,\, 2} = 5800$ and $5150\, \rm K$, $R_2= 8.3$ and $9\, {\rm R}_{\odot }$) and thus are consistent with observed UV limits that would rule out main-sequence stars with similar masses ($M_2 \approx 2.8$ and ${\approx}1.8\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$). In the Unicorn, rapid rotation blurs the spectral lines of the subgiant, making it challenging to detect even at wavelengths where it dominates the total light. Both giants have surface abundances indicative of CNO processing and subsequent envelope stripping. The properties of both systems can be reproduced by binary evolution models in which a $1{-}2\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$ primary is stripped by a companion as it ascends the giant branch. The fact that the companions are also evolved implies either that the initial mass ratio was very near unity, or that the companions are temporarily inflated due to rapid accretion. The Unicorn and Giraffe offer a window into into a rarely observed phase of binary evolution preceding the formation of wide-orbit helium white dwarfs, and eventually, compact binaries containing two helium white dwarfs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.5620E,[]
Discovery and characterization of five new eclipsing AM CVn systems,"AM CVn systems are ultra-compact, hydrogen-depleted, and helium-rich, accreting binaries with degenerate or semidegenerate donors. We report the discovery of five new eclipsing AM CVn systems with orbital periods of 61.5, 55.5, 53.3, 37.4, and 35.4 min. These systems were discovered by searching for deep eclipses in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) light curves of white dwarfs selected using Gaia parallaxes. We obtained phase-resolved spectroscopy to confirm that all systems are AM CVn binaries, and we obtained high-speed photometry to confirm the eclipse and characterize the systems. The spectra show double-peaked H e lines but also show metals, including K and Zn, elements that have never been detected in AM CVn systems before. By modelling the high-speed photometry, we measured the mass and radius of the donor star, potentially constraining the evolutionary channel that formed these AM CVn systems. We determined that the average mass of the accreting white dwarf is ≈0.8 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and that the white dwarfs in long-period systems are hotter than predicted by recently updated theoretical models. The donors have a high entropy and are a factor of ≈2 more massive compared to zero-entropy donors at the same orbital period. The large donor radius is most consistent with H e-star progenitors, although the observed spectral features seem to contradict this. The discovery of five new eclipsing AM CVn systems is consistent with the known observed AM CVn space density and estimated ZTF recovery efficiency.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.5440V,[]
"Cosmology intertwined: A review of the particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology associated with the cosmological tensions and anomalies","The standard Λ Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model provides a good description of a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological data. However, there are a few big open questions that make the standard model look like an approximation to a more realistic scenario yet to be found. In this paper, we list a few important goals that need to be addressed in the next decade, taking into account the current discordances between the different cosmological probes, such as the disagreement in the value of the Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB>, the σ<SUB>8</SUB>-S<SUB>8</SUB> tension, and other less statistically significant anomalies. While these discordances can still be in part the result of systematic errors, their persistence after several years of accurate analysis strongly hints at cracks in the standard cosmological scenario and the necessity for new physics or generalisations beyond the standard model. In this paper, we focus on the 5.0 σ tension between the Planck CMB estimate of the Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB> and the SH0ES collaboration measurements. After showing the H<SUB>0</SUB> evaluations made from different teams using different methods and geometric calibrations, we list a few interesting new physics models that could alleviate this tension and discuss how the next decade's experiments will be crucial. Moreover, we focus on the tension of the Planck CMB data with weak lensing measurements and redshift surveys, about the value of the matter energy density Ω<SUB>m</SUB>, and the amplitude or rate of the growth of structure (σ<SUB>8</SUB> , fσ<SUB>8</SUB>). We list a few interesting models proposed for alleviating this tension, and we discuss the importance of trying to fit a full array of data with a single model and not just one parameter at a time. Additionally, we present a wide range of other less discussed anomalies at a statistical significance level lower than the H<SUB>0</SUB>-S<SUB>8</SUB> tensions which may also constitute hints towards new physics, and we discuss possible generic theoretical approaches that can collectively explain the non-standard nature of these signals. Finally, we give an overview of upgraded experiments and next-generation space missions and facilities on Earth that will be of crucial importance to address all these open questions.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JHEAp..34...49A,[]
"Revealing nature of GRB 210205A, ZTF21aaeyldq (AT2021any) and follow-up observations with the 4K×4K CCD imager + 3.6m DOT","Optical follow-up observations of optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts are crucial to probe the geometry of outflows, emission mechanisms, energetics and burst environments. We performed the follow-up observations of GRB 210205A and ZTF21aaeyldq (AT2021any) using the 3.6m Devasthal optical telescope (DOT) around one day after the burst to deeper limits due to the longitudinal advantage of the place. This paper presents our analysis of the two objects using data from other collaborative facilities, i.e., 2.2m Calar Alto Astronomical Observatory (CAHA) and other archival data. Our analysis suggests that GRB 210205A is a potential dark burst once compared with the X-ray afterglow data. Also, comparing results with other known and well-studied dark GRBs samples indicate that the reason for the optical darkness of GRB 210205A could either be intrinsic faintness or a high redshift event. Based on our analysis, we also found that ZTF21aaeyldq is the third known orphan afterglow with a measured redshift except for ZTF20aajnksq (AT2020blt) and ZTF19abvizsw (AT2019pim). The multiwavelength afterglow modeling of ZTF21aaeyldq using the afterglowpy package demands a forward shock model for an ISM-like ambient medium with a rather wider jet opening angle. We determine circumburst density of n<SUB>0</SUB>=0.87 cm-<SUP>3</SUP>, kinetic energy E<SUB>k</SUB>=3.80 ×10<SUP>52</SUP> erg and the afterglow modeling also indicates that ZTF21aaeyldq is observed on-axis (θ<SUB>obs</SUB><θ<SUB>core</SUB> ) and a gamma-ray counterpart was missed by GRBs satellites. Our results emphasize that the 3.6m DOT has a unique capability for deep follow-up observations of similar and other new transients for deeper observations as a part of time-domain astronomy in the future.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JApA...43...11G,[]
Optical flux and spectral characterization of the blazar PG 1553 + 113 based on the past 15 years of data,"We study flux and spectral variability of the high energy peaked TeV blazar PG 1553 + 113 on diverse timescales using the data collected from 2005 to 2019 which also includes the intensive intra-night monitoring of the target. Additionally, we recorded the brightest flare of the blazar PG 1553 + 113 during April 2019 when the source attained an R-band magnitude of 13.2. Analyzing the spectral evolution of the source during the flare gave a clockwise spectral hysteresis loop and a time lag with V-band variations leading to the R-band ones. Various statistical tests, fitting procedures and cross-correlation techniques are applied to search for periodicity and examine the color-magnitude relationship. We find a median period of (2.21 ± 0.04) years along with the secondary period of about 210 days. Finally, we briefly discuss various physical mechanisms which are capable of explaining our findings.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JApA...43....9A,[]
"Influence of Tectonic Factor on Porphyry Copper Deposits Localization and Distribution (Arasbaran District, NW Iran): Synthesis of Alteration Patterns and Lineaments Using Digital Techniques","The Kighal and Bormolk porphyry copper deposits (PCDs) are known subeconomic deposits and are ~10 km south of Sungun, the world-class copper mine in NW Iran. The deposits are located in the Azerbaijan plateau, within Alborz, Zagros, and Caucasus Mountain ranges, having undergone active tectonics, including uplift and thrust-folding from the Cimmerrian Orogeny. The sub-economic nature of the Kighal and Bormolk deposits, despite their relatively close distance and age and lithologic similarity to those of the Sungun deposit, has been discussed. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery were used to map alteration patterns and lineaments associated with these deposits. In order to discriminate alteration minerals of the deposits in comparison with those in the Sungun deposit, the ASTER image was processed using False Color Composite (FCC), Band Ratio (BR), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF), and Mixture-Tuned Matched-Filtering (MTMF) techniques, which recognize seven alteration types in the Kighal−Bormolk area and three types in the Sungun area, including its more intense alteration systems. The results were verified by field observations, mineralogical, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. Also, lineament extraction of DEM and Landsat 8 OLI data by Envi 5.1, Geomatica, ArcGIS 10.6, and Rockworks 16, displayed a lower density of fault intersections in the Kighal−Bormolk area. Additionally, NW−SE trending lineaments of the Sungun deposit, which is in accordance with most of the valuable porphyry copper deposits in Iran, are taken into account.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Geote..56..382R,[]
Compact Binary Coalescences: Astrophysical Processes and Lessons Learned,"On 11 February 2016, the LIGO and Virgo scientific collaborations announced the first direct detection of gravitational waves, a signal caught by the LIGO interferometers on 14 September 2015, and produced by the coalescence of two stellar-mass black holes. The discovery represented the beginning of an entirely new way to investigate the Universe. The latest gravitational-wave catalog by LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA brings the total number of gravitational-wave events to 90, and the count is expected to significantly increase in the next years, when additional ground-based and space-born interferometers will be operational. From the theoretical point of view, we have only fuzzy ideas about where the detected events came from, and the answers to most of the five Ws and How for the astrophysics of compact binary coalescences are still unknown. In this work, we review our current knowledge and uncertainties on the astrophysical processes behind merging compact-object binaries. Furthermore, we discuss the astrophysical lessons learned through the latest gravitational-wave detections, paying specific attention to the theoretical challenges coming from exceptional events (e.g., GW190521 and GW190814).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Galax..10...76S,[]
A pure hadronic model description of the observed neutrino emission from the tidal disruption event AT2019dsg,"Recently, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has detected the neutrino event IceCube-170922A from the radio-emitting tidal disruption event (TDE) named AT2019dsg, indicating to be one of the most likely sources of high-energy cosmic rays. So far, the photo-hadronic interaction is considered in the literature to interpret neutrino emission from AT2019dsg. Here, we examine whether the IceCube-170922A along with the broadband electromagnetic emission from the source can also be described by a pure hadronic emission employing the proton blazar inspired (PBI) model, which takes into account the non-relativistic protons that emerge under the charge neutrality situation of the blazar jet and thus offers sufficient target matter for pp interactions with shock-accelerated protons. Our findings show that the PBI model is able to consistently describe the IceCube observations on AT2019dsg and the broadband spectrum of the source without exceeding the observed X-ray and gamma-ray flux upper limits imposed by the XMM-Newton and Fermi-LAT telescopes.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022EPJC...82..517B,[]
"The OGLE Collection of Variable Stars: Nearly 66,000 Mira Stars in the Milky Way","We present a collection of 65,981 Mira-type variable stars found in the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) project database. Two-thirds of our sample (40,356 objects) are located in the Galactic bulge fields, whereas 25,625 stars are in the Galactic disk. The vast majority of the collection (47,532 objects) comprises new discoveries. We provide basic observational parameters of the Mira variables: equatorial coordinates, pulsation periods, I-band and V-band mean magnitudes, I-band brightness amplitudes, and identifications in other catalogs of variable stars. We also provide the I-band and V-band time-series photometry collected since 1997 during the OGLE-II, OGLE-III, and OGLE-IV phases. The classical selection process, i.e., being mostly based on the visual inspection of light curves by experienced astronomers, has led to the high purity of the catalog. As a result, this collection can be used as a training set for machine-learning classification algorithms. Using overlapping areas of adjacent OGLE fields, we estimate the completeness of the catalog to be about 96%. We compare and discuss the statistical features of Miras located in different regions of the Milky Way. We show examples of stars that change their type over time, from a semiregular variable to Mira and vice versa. This data set is perfectly suited to studying the three-dimensional structure of the Milky Way, and it may help to explain the puzzle of the X-shaped bulge.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..260...46I,[]
GB6 J2113+1121: A Multiwavelength Flaring γ-Ray Blazar Temporally and Spatially Coincident with the Neutrino Event IceCube-191001A,"A radio-emitting tidal disruption event (AT2019dsg) is proposed as a likely counterpart to the IceCube neutrino event IC 191001A. In this work, we have revisited the Fermi-LAT data in the direction of the neutrino and confirmed no signal at the site of AT2019dsg. Instead, at the edge of the 90% confidence level error region of this neutrino, there is a γ-ray transient source associated with the blazar GB6 J2113+1121. In 2019 May, GB6 J2113+1121 was undergoing a γ-ray flare that is unprecedented since the start of the Fermi-LAT operation, with a variability amplitude of about 20 fold. Similar violent flares of GB6 J2113+1121, unobserved before, have also been detected in the optical bands. Moreover, the blazar remained in a high-flux state in the infrared bands when IC 191001A arrived, though the blazar 's γ-ray and optical activities have temporarily ceased. Motivated by this spatial and temporal coincidence, we suggest that GB6 J2113+1121 is a candidate to be the counterpart to IC 191001A. The jet properties of GB6 J2113+1121 are investigated, which are found to be comparable with that of neutrino-emitting blazars (candidates). A specific analysis of archival IceCube data in this direction and future observations would put further constraints on the origin of the neutrino.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...932L..25L,[]
Optical Light Curve of 4FGL J0935.3+0901: A Flaring Black Widow Candidate,"I obtained time-series photometry of the compact binary candidate for the Fermi source 4FGL J0935.3+0901. Superposed on the 2.44 hr orbital modulation are day-to-day variations and frequent flaring as seen in several redback and black widow millisecond pulsars (MSPs). The short orbital period favors a black widow. While the modulation of ≤1 mag is smaller than that of most black widows, it could indicate a low orbital inclination. Although a published optical spectrum shows strong emission lines, the light curve evinces pulsar heating of the companion star rather than accretion-disk emission of a transitional MSP. Emission lines and flaring occur in the same objects, probably powered by shocks between the relativistic pulsar wind and a wind driven off the companion star. I also recovered the period in photometry from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). A phase-connected ephemeris derived from MDM Observatory and ZTF data spanning 4 yr yields a period of 0.10153276(36) days and an epoch for the ascending node of the putative pulsar.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...932L...8H,[]
The Large Superfast Rotators Discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility,"Two high-cadence surveys aiming for rotation period measurements of asteroids have been conducted in 2019 January and October using the Zwicky Transient Facility. From the surveys, 25 large superfast rotators (SFRs) were discovered and they are all main-belt asteroids (MBAs), except for one Mars crosser. These large SFRs have a diameter ranging from 0.43 to 7.87 km and a rotation period between 0.48 and 1.95 hr. Considering their diameters and fast rotations, they cannot be explained by rubble-pile structure unless using extraordinary high bulk densities. Cohesion, if available, can conserve these large SFRs. The estimated cohesion for these large SFRs could be up to thousands of pascals, much higher than the currently estimated cohesion for asteroids and that generated by the regolith of Moon and Mars. Such high-level cohesion can be produced from fine-grain regolith, like clay. However, the availability of such fine-grain regolith for asteroids is still unknown. Although the possibility of these large SFRs being large monolithic objects cannot be ruled out, this scenario is very unlikely given that the timescale of disruptive impact for MBAs in a similar diameter range is 10<SUP>7</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> yr.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...932L...5C,[]
A Speed Bump: SN 2021aefx Shows that Doppler Shift Alone Can Explain Early Excess Blue Flux in Some Type Ia Supernovae,"We present early-time photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2021aefx. The early-time u-band light curve shows an excess flux when compared to normal SNe Ia. We suggest that the early excess blue flux may be due to a rapid change in spectral velocity in the first few days post explosion, produced by the emission of the Ca II H&K feature passing from the u to the B bands on the timescale of a few days. This effect could be dominant for all SNe Ia that have broad absorption features and early-time velocities over 25,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. It is likely to be one of the main causes of early excess u-band flux in SNe Ia that have early-time high velocities. This effect may also be dominant in the UV filters, as well as in places where the SN spectral energy distribution is quickly rising to longer wavelengths. The rapid change in velocity can only produce a monotonic change (in flux-space) in the u band. For objects that explode at lower velocities, and have a more structured shape in the early excess emission, there must also be an additional parameter producing the early-time diversity. More early-time observations, in particular early spectra, are required to determine how prominent this effect is within SNe Ia.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...932L...2A,[]
Searching for Anomalies in the ZTF Catalog of Periodic Variable Stars,"Periodic variables illuminate the physical processes of stars throughout their lifetime. Wide-field surveys continue to increase our discovery rates of periodic variable stars. Automated approaches are essential to identify interesting periodic variable stars for multiwavelength and spectroscopic follow-up. Here we present a novel unsupervised machine-learning approach to hunt for anomalous periodic variables using phase-folded light curves presented in the Zwicky Transient Facility Catalogue of Periodic Variable Stars by Chen et al. We use a convolutional variational autoencoder to learn a low-dimensional latent representation, and we search for anomalies within this latent dimension via an isolation forest. We identify anomalies with irregular variability. Most of the top anomalies are likely highly variable red giants or asymptotic giant branch stars concentrated in the Milky Way galactic disk; a fraction of the identified anomalies are more consistent with young stellar objects. Detailed spectroscopic follow-up observations are encouraged to reveal the nature of these anomalies.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...932..118C,[]
"Luminous Millimeter, Radio, and X-Ray Emission from ZTF 20acigmel (AT 2020xnd)","Observations of the extragalactic (z = 0.0141) transient AT 2018cow established a new class of energetic explosions shocking a dense medium, producing luminous emission at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths. Here we present detailed millimeter- through centimeter-wave observations of a similar transient, ZTF 20acigmel (AT 2020xnd), at z = 0.2433. Using observations from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array and the Very Large Array, we model the unusual millimeter and radio emission from AT 2020xnd under several different assumptions and ultimately favor synchrotron radiation from a thermal electron population (relativistic Maxwellian). The thermal electron model implies a fast but subrelativistic (v ≈ 0.3c) shock and a high ambient density (n <SUB> e </SUB> ≈ 4 × 10<SUP>3</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) at Δt ≈ 40 days. The X-ray luminosity of L <SUB> X </SUB> ≈ 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> exceeds simple predictions from the radio and UVOIR luminosity and likely has a separate physical origin, such as a central engine. Using the fact that month-long luminous (L <SUB> ν </SUB> ≈ 2 × 10<SUP>30</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> Hz<SUP>-1</SUP> at 100 GHz) millimeter emission appears to be a generic feature of transients with fast (t <SUB>1/2</SUB> ≈ 3 days) and luminous (M <SUB>peak</SUB> ≈ -21 mag) optical light curves, we estimate the rate at which transients like AT 2018cow and AT 2020xnd will be detected by future wide-field millimeter transient surveys such as CMB-S4 and conclude that energetic explosions in dense environments may represent a significant population of extragalactic transients in the 100 GHz sky.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...932..116H,[]
"The Circumstellar Environments of Double-peaked, Calcium-strong Transients 2021gno and 2021inl","We present panchromatic observations and modeling of calcium-strong supernovae (SNe) 2021gno in the star-forming host-galaxy NGC 4165 and 2021inl in the outskirts of elliptical galaxy NGC 4923, both monitored through the Young Supernova Experiment transient survey. The light curves of both, SNe show two peaks, the former peak being derived from shock cooling emission (SCE) and/or shock interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). The primary peak in SN 2021gno is coincident with luminous, rapidly decaying X-ray emission (L <SUB> x </SUB> = 5 × 10<SUP>41</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) detected by Swift-XRT at δ t = 1 day after explosion, this observation being the second-ever detection of X-rays from a calcium-strong transient. We interpret the X-ray emission in the context of shock interaction with CSM that extends to r < 3 × 10<SUP>14</SUP> cm. Based on X-ray modeling, we calculate a CSM mass M <SUB>CSM</SUB> = (0.3-1.6) × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> and density n = (1-4) × 10<SUP>10</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>.

The explosion properties suggest progenitor systems containing either a low-mass massive star or a white dwarf (WD), the former being unlikely given the lack of local star formation.

NICER Monitoring of Supersoft X-Ray Sources,"We monitored four supersoft sources-two persistent ones, CAL 83 and MR Vel, and the recent novae YZ Ret (Nova Ret 2020), and V1674 Her (Nova Her 2021)-with NICER. The two persistent supersoft X-ray sources (SSS) were observed with unvaried X-ray flux level and spectrum, respectively, 13 and 20 yr after the last observations. Short-period modulations of the SSS appear where the spectrum of the luminous central source was fully visible (in CAL 83 and V1674 Her) and were absent in YZ Ret and MR Vel, in which the flux originated in photoionized or shocked plasma, while the white dwarf (WD) was not observable. We thus suggest that the pulsations occur on, or very close to, the WD surface. The pulsations of CAL 83 were almost unvaried after 15 yr, including an irregular drift of the ≃67 s period by 2.1 s. Simulations, including previous XMM-Newton data, indicate actual variations in period length within hours, rather than an artifact of the variable amplitude of the pulsations. Large amplitude pulsations with a period of 501.53 ± 0.30 s were always detected in V1674 Her, as long as the SSS was observable. This period seems to be due to rotation of a highly magnetized WD. We cannot confirm the maximum effective temperature of (≃145,000 K) previously inferred for this nova, and discuss the difficulty in interpreting its spectrum. The WD appears to present two surface zones, one of which does not emit SSS flux.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...932...45O,[]
In Search of Short Gamma-Ray Burst Optical Counterparts with the Zwicky Transient Facility,"The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggers on-board in response to ~40 short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) per year; however, their large localization regions have made the search for optical counterparts a challenging endeavour. We have developed and executed an extensive program with the wide field of view of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) camera, mounted on the Palomar 48 inch Oschin telescope (P48), to perform target-of-opportunity (ToO) observations on 10 Fermi-GBM SGRBs during 2018 and 2020-2021. Bridging the large sky areas with small field-of-view optical telescopes in order to track the evolution of potential candidates, we look for the elusive SGRB afterglows and kilonovae (KNe) associated with these high-energy events. No counterpart has yet been found, even though more than 10 ground-based telescopes, part of the Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) network, have taken part in these efforts. The candidate selection procedure and the follow-up strategy have shown that ZTF is an efficient instrument for searching for poorly localized SGRBs, retrieving a reasonable number of candidates to follow up and showing promising capabilities as the community approaches the multi-messenger era. Based on the median limiting magnitude of ZTF, our searches would have been able to retrieve a GW170817-like event up to ~200 Mpc and SGRB afterglows to z = 0.16 or 0.4, depending on the assumed underlying energy model.

The Peculiar Short-duration GRB 200826A and Its Supernova,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are classified into long and short events. Long GRBs (LGRBs) are associated with the end states of very massive stars, while short GRBs (SGRBs) are linked to the merger of compact objects. GRB 200826A was a peculiar event, because by definition it was an SGRB, with a rest-frame duration of ~0.5 s. However, this event was energetic and soft, which is consistent with LGRBs. The relatively low redshift (z = 0.7486) motivated a comprehensive, multiwavelength follow-up campaign to characterize its host, search for a possible associated supernova (SN), and thus understand the origin of this burst. To this aim we obtained a combination of deep near-infrared (NIR) and optical imaging together with spectroscopy. Our analysis reveals an optical and NIR bump in the light curve whose luminosity and evolution are in agreement with several SNe associated to LGRBs. Analysis of the prompt GRB shows that this event follows the E <SUB>p,i</SUB>-E <SUB>iso</SUB> relation found for LGRBs. The host galaxy is a low-mass star-forming galaxy, typical of LGRBs, but with one of the highest star formation rates, especially with respect to its mass ( $\mathrm{log}{M}_{* }/{M}_{\odot }=8.6$ , SFR ~ 4.0 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>). We conclude that GRB 200826A is a typical collapsar event in the low tail of the duration distribution of LGRBs. These findings support theoretical predictions that events produced by collapsars can be as short as 0.5 s in the host frame and further confirm that duration alone is not an efficient discriminator for the progenitor class of a GRB. <SUP>*</SUP> Based on data obtained with the LBT programs: LBT-2019B-18 (PI A.

Joint analysis of multiband photometry from TESS, Multicolor Simultaneous Camera for studying Atmospheres of Transiting exoplanets (MuSCAT), MuSCAT3, Sinistro, and KeplerCam confirmed the transit signal to be achromatic as well as refined the orbital ephemeris. High-resolution imaging with Gemini/'Alopeke and high-resolution spectroscopy with the Subaru InfraRed Doppler (IRD) confirmed that there are no stellar companions or background sources to the star. The spectroscopic observations with IRD and Infrared Telescope Facility SpeX were used to determine the stellar parameters, and it was found that the host star is an M4 dwarf with an effective temperature of T <SUB>eff</SUB> = 3185 ± 76 K and a metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.336 ± 0.060 dex.

TOI-1696 and TOI-2136: Constraining the Masses of Two Mini-Neptunes with the Habitable-Zone Planet Finder,"We present the validation of two planets orbiting M dwarfs, TOI-1696b and TOI-2136b. Both planets are mini-Neptunes orbiting nearby stars, making them promising prospects for atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We validated the planetary nature of both candidates using high-contrast imaging, ground-based photometry, and near-infrared radial velocities. Adaptive optics images were taken using the ShARCS camera on the 3 m Shane Telescope. Speckle images were taken using the NN-Explore Exoplanet Stellar Speckle Imager on the WIYN 3.5 m telescope. Radii and orbital ephemerides were refined using a combination of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, the diffuser-assisted Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) Telescope Imaging Camera (ARCTIC) imager on the 3.5 m ARC telescope at Apache Point Observatory, and the 0.6 m telescope at Red Buttes Observatory. We obtained radial velocities using the Habitable-Zone Planet Finder on the 10 m Hobby-Eberly Telescope, which enabled us to place upper limits on the masses of both transiting planets. TOI-1696b (P = 2.5 days; R <SUB> p </SUB> = 3.24 R <SUB>⊕</SUB>; M <SUB> p </SUB> < 56.6 M <SUB>⊕</SUB>) falls into a sparsely populated region of parameter space considering its host star's temperature (T <SUB>eff</SUB> = 3168 K, M4.5), as planets of its size are quite rare around mid- to late-M dwarfs. On the other hand, TOI-2136b (P = 7.85 days; R <SUB> p </SUB> = 2.09 R <SUB>⊕</SUB>; M <SUB> p </SUB> < 15.0 M <SUB>⊕</SUB>) is an excellent candidate for atmospheric follow-up with the JWST.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..286B,[]
"A Young, Low-density Stellar Stream in the Milky Way Disk: Theia 456","Our view of the variety of stellar structures pervading the local Milky Way has been transformed by the application of clustering algorithms to the Gaia catalog. In particular, several stellar streams have been recently discovered that are comprised of hundreds to thousands of stars and span several hundred parsecs. We analyze one such structure, Theia 456, a low-density stellar stream extending nearly 200 pc and 20° across the sky. By supplementing Gaia astrometric data with spectroscopic metallicities from Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope and photometric rotation periods from the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we establish Theia 456's radial velocity coherence, and we find strong evidence that members of Theia 456 have a common age (≃175 Myr), common dynamical origin, and formed from chemically homogeneous prestellar material ([Fe/H] = -0.07 dex). Unlike well-known stellar streams in the Milky Way, which are in its halo, Theia 456 is firmly part of the thin disk. If our conclusions about Theia 456 can be applied to even a small fraction of the remaining ≃8300 independent structures in the Theia catalog, such low-density stellar streams may be ubiquitous. We comment on the implications this has for the nature of star formation throughout the Galaxy.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..275A,[]
A Zwicky Transient Facility Look at Optical Variability of Young Stellar Objects in the North America and Pelican Nebulae Complex,"We present a study of 323 photometrically variable young stellar objects that are likely members of the North America and Pelican nebulae star-forming region. To do so, we utilize over two years of data in the g and r photometric bands from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We first investigate periodic variability, finding 46 objects (~15% of the sample) with significant periods that phase well and can be attributed to stellar rotation. We then use the quasiperiodicity (Q) and flux asymmetry (M) variability metrics to assign morphological classifications to the remaining aperiodic light curves. Another ~39% of the variable star sample beyond the periodic (low Q) sources are also flux-symmetric, but with a quasiperiodic (moderate Q) or stochastic (high Q) nature. Concerning flux-asymmetric sources, our analysis reveals ~14% bursters (high negative M) and ~29% dippers (high positive M). We also investigate the relationship between variability slopes in the g versus g - r color-magnitude diagram, and the light-curve morphological classes. Burster-type objects have shallow slopes, while dipper-type variables tend to have higher slopes that are consistent with extinction-driven variability. Our work is one of the earliest applications of the Q and M metrics to ground-based data. We therefore contrast the Q values of high-cadence and high-precision space-based data, for which these metrics were designed, with Q determinations resulting from degraded space-based light curves that have the cadence and photometric precision characteristic of ground-based data.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..263H,[]
Activity and Rotation of Nearby Field M Dwarfs in the TESS Southern Continuous Viewing Zone,"The evolution of magnetism in late-type dwarfs remains murky, as we can only weakly predict levels of activity for M dwarfs of a given mass and age. We report results from our spectroscopic survey of M dwarfs in the Southern Continuous Viewing Zone (CVZ) of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). As the TESS CVZs overlap with those of the James Webb Space Telescope, our targets constitute a legacy sample for studies of nearby M dwarfs. For 122 stars, we obtained at least one R ≈ 2000 optical spectrum with which we measure chromospheric Hα emission, a proxy for magnetic field strength. The fraction of active stars is consistent with what is expected for field M dwarfs; as in previous studies, we find that late-type M dwarfs remain active for longer than their early-type counterparts. While the TESS light curves for ≈20% of our targets show modulations consistent with rotation, TESS systematics are not well enough understood for confident measurements of rotation periods (P <SUB>rot</SUB>) longer than half the length of an observing sector. We report periods for 12 stars for which we measure P <SUB>rot</SUB> ≲ 15 days or find confirmation for the TESS-derived P <SUB>rot</SUB> in the literature. Our sample of 21 P <SUB>rot</SUB>, which includes periods from the literature, is consistent with our targets being spun-down field stars. Finally, we examine the Hα-to-bolometric luminosity distribution for our sample. Two stars are rotating fast enough to be magnetically saturated, but are not, hinting at the possibility that fast rotators may appear inactive in Hα.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..257A,[]
"Magnetic Activity on Four Short-period Contact Binaries: V0576 Peg, KW Psc, V0873 Per, and FY Boo","We presented new photometry for four short-period late-type binaries, observed by three small telescopes in China from 2020 September to 2021 December. Seven sets of light curves (including the TESS data for FY Boo) were analyzed by using the W-D method. Three binaries (V0576 Peg, V0873 Per, and FY Boo) are W-type binaries with q ≃ 2.5, while KW Psc is an A-type binary with q ≃ 0.43. Max.I-Max.II is up to 10% of variable light amplitude for the asymmetric light curves, which are modeled by a dark spot on the surface of the more massive component. Photometric results imply the existence of movement and evolution of the cool spot. From the temperature-luminosity and mass-luminosity diagrams, the more massive components are a bit evolved main-sequence stars, while the less massive ones are oversized and overluminous owing to energy exchange. Orbital period analyses indicate that the cyclic oscillations occur in the (O - C) curves. Their modulated periods approach 11 yr, which may preferably result from the magnetic activity cycle for four late-type contact binaries. With angular momentum loss through magnetic braking, these short-period contact binaries may evolve into deep-contact configurations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..250Y,[]
Hitting a New Low: The Unique 28 hr Cessation of Accretion in the TESS Light Curve of YY Dra (DO Dra),"We present the Transiting Exoplanet Surveying Satellite light curve of the intermediate polar YY Draconis (YY Dra, also known as DO Dra). The power spectrum indicates that while there is stream-fed accretion for most of the observational period, there is a day-long, flat-bottomed low state at the beginning of 2020 during which the only periodic signal is ellipsoidal variation and there is no appreciable flickering. We interpret this low state to be a complete cessation of accretion, a phenomenon that has been observed only once before in an intermediate polar. Simultaneous ground-based observations of this faint state establish that when accretion is negligible, YY Dra fades to g = 17.37 ± 0.12, which we infer to be the magnitude of the combined photospheric contributions of the white dwarf and its red dwarf companion. Using survey photometry, we identify additional low states in 2018-2019 during which YY Dra repeatedly fades to-but never below-this threshold. This implies relatively frequent cessations in accretion. Spectroscopic observations during future episodes of negligible accretion can be used to directly measure the field strength of the white dwarf by Zeeman splitting. Separately, we search newly available catalogs of variable stars in an attempt to resolve the long-standing dispute over the proper identifier of this system.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..246H,[]
XMM-Newton and TESS observations of the highly variable polar V496 UMa,,,[]
Aims: We studied the temporal and spectral behavior of V496 UMa from the optical to the X-ray regimes.,,,[]
"Methods: We used archival XMM-Newton and TESS observations obtained in 2017 and 2019, respectively, to perform a spectral and timing analysis of the highly variable magnetic CV.",,,[]
"Results: The light curves of the TESS and XMM-Newton satellites reveal a double-humped pattern modulated with the periodicity of 91.058467 ± 0.00001 min. V496 UMa displays a two-pole accretion geometry in the high accretion state. X-ray spectra from these regions are composed of thermal plasma radiation and soft blackbody components with almost identical temperatures and a total accretion rate of Ṁ = 1.4(8) × 10<SUP>−11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>−1</SUP>. The X-ray centers of the humps show longitudinal shifts of −18° and 4°, and shifts around photometric phase zero of −172° and −186°, for the main hump and second hump, respectively. The long-term ZTF light curves reveal high and low accretions states. Low-state ZTF and SDSS photometric data are consistent with an 0.8 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> white dwarf at 10 000 K and a main-sequence donor star with a spectral type of M5.0 at a Gaia determined distance of 758 pc.",,,[]
"Conclusions: V496 UMa is a very bright polar in X-rays when it is in the high state. Due to its unusual geometric structure, mass accretion onto the second accretion pole is interrupted occasionally. This discontinuous behavior does not follow a certain pattern in time and has been observed so far only in the high state. The X-ray light curves display clear evidence of an accretion stream at the photometric phase of ϕ = 0.81, which does not show up in optical light curves. An accurate period was derived using the combined TESS and XMM-Newton data, which differs by 3.8σ from published results.",,,[]

AutoSourceID-Light. Fast optical source localization via U-Net and Laplacian of Gaussian,,,[]
"Aims: With the ever-increasing survey speed of optical wide-field telescopes and the importance of discovering transients when they are still young, rapid and reliable source localization is paramount. We present AutoSourceID-Light (ASID-L), an innovative framework that uses computer vision techniques that can naturally deal with large amounts of data and rapidly localize sources in optical images.",,,[]
Methods: We show that the ASID-L algorithm based on U-shaped networks and enhanced with a Laplacian of Gaussian filter provides outstanding performance in the localization of sources. A U-Net network discerns the sources in the images from many different artifacts and passes the result to a Laplacian of Gaussian filter that then estimates the exact location.,,,[]
"Results: Using ASID-L on the optical images of the MeerLICHT telescope demonstrates the great speed and localization power of the method. We compare the results with SExtractor and show that our method outperforms this more widely used method. ASID-L rapidly detects more sources not only in low- and mid-density fields, but particularly in areas with more than 150 sources per square arcminute. The training set and code used in this paper are publicly available.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...662A.109S,,[]
The population of hot subdwarf stars studied with Gaia. IV. Catalogues of hot subluminous stars based on Gaia EDR3,"In light of substantial new discoveries of hot subdwarfs by ongoing spectroscopic surveys and the availability of the Gaia mission Early Data Release 3 (EDR3), we compiled new releases of two catalogues of hot subluminous stars: The data release 3 (DR3) catalogue of the known hot subdwarf stars contains 6616 unique sources and provides multi-band photometry, and astrometry from Gaia EDR3 as well as classifications based on spectroscopy and colours. This is an increase of 742 objects over the DR2 catalogue. This new catalogue provides atmospheric parameters for 3087 stars and radial velocities for 2791 stars from the literature. In addition, we have updated the Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) catalogue of hot subluminous stars using the improved accuracy of the Gaia EDR3 data set together with updated quality and selection criteria to produce the Gaia EDR3 catalogue of 61 585 hot subluminous stars, representing an increase of 21 785 objects. The improvements in Gaia EDR3 astrometry and photometry compared to Gaia DR2 have enabled us to define more sophisticated selection functions. In particular, we improved hot subluminous star detection in the crowded regions of the Galactic plane as well as in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds by including sources with close apparent neighbours but with flux levels that dominate the neighbourhood.",,[]

Infrared Spectral Energy Distribution and Variability of Active Galactic Nuclei: Clues to the Structure of Circumnuclear Material,"The active galactic nucleus (AGN) phenomenon results from a supermassive black hole accreting its surrounding gaseous and dusty material. The infrared (IR) regime provides most of the information to characterize the dusty structures that bridge from the galaxy to the black hole, providing clues to the black hole growth and host galaxy evolution. Over the past several decades, with the commissioning of various ground, airborne and space IR observing facilities, our interpretations of the AGN circumnuclear structures have advanced significantly through an improved understanding of how their dust emission changes as a function of wavelength and how the heating of the dusty structures responds to variations in the energy released from the central engine. In this review, we summarize the current observational knowledge of the AGN IR broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and the IR time variability behavior covering large ranges of AGN luminosity and redshift, and discuss some first-order insights into the obscuring structures and host galaxy IR properties that can be obtained by integrating the relevant observations into a coherent picture.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Univ....8..304L,[]
"Antarctic Survey Telescope 3-3: Overview, System Performance and Preliminary Observations at Yaoan, Yunnan","The third Antarctic Survey Telescope array instrument at Dome A in Antarctica, the AST3-3 telescope, has been in commissioning from March 2021.

Detecting and Monitoring Tidal Dissipation of Hot Jupiters in the Era of SiTian,"Transit Timing Variation (TTV) of hot Jupiters provides direct observational evidence of planet tidal dissipation. Detecting tidal dissipation through TTV needs high precision transit timings and long timing baselines. In this work, we predict and discuss the potential scientific contribution of the SiTian Survey in detecting and analyzing exoplanet TTV. We develop a tidal dissipation detection pipeline for the SiTian Survey that aims at time-domain astronomy with 72 1 m optical telescopes. The pipeline includes the modules of light curve deblending, transit timing acquisition and TTV modeling. SiTian is capable of detecting more than 25,000 exoplanets among which we expect ~50 sources to show evidence of tidal dissipation. We present detection and analysis of tidal dissipating targets, based on simulated SiTian light curves of XO-3b and WASP-161b. The transit light curve modeling gives consistent results within 1σ to input values of simulated light curves. Also, the parameter uncertainties predicted by Markov Chain Monte Carlo are consistent with the distribution obtained from simulating and modeling the light curve 1000 times. The timing precision of SiTian observations is ~0.5 minutes with one transit visit. We show that differences between TTV origins, e.g., tidal dissipation, apsidal precession and multiple planets, would be significant, considering the timing precision and baseline. The detection rate of tidal dissipating hot Jupiters would answer a crucial question of whether the planet migrates at an early formation stage or random stages due to perturbations, e.g., planet scattering or secular interaction. SiTian identified targets would be constructive given that the sample would extend tenfold.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022RAA....22e5005Y,[]
Apophis Planetary Defense Campaign,"We describe results of a planetary defense exercise conducted during the close approach to Earth by the near-Earth asteroid (99942) Apophis during 2020 December-2021 March. The planetary defense community has been conducting observational campaigns since 2017 to test the operational readiness of the global planetary defense capabilities. These community-led global exercises were carried out with the support of NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office and the International Asteroid Warning Network. The Apophis campaign is the third in our series of planetary defense exercises. The goal of this campaign was to recover, track, and characterize Apophis as a potential impactor to exercise the planetary defense system including observations, hypothetical risk assessment and risk prediction, and hazard communication. Based on the campaign results, we present lessons learned about our ability to observe and model a potential impactor. Data products derived from astrometric observations were available for inclusion in our risk assessment model almost immediately, allowing real-time updates to the impact probability calculation and possible impact locations. An early NEOWISE diameter measurement provided a significant improvement in the uncertainty on the range of hypothetical impact outcomes. The availability of different characterization methods such as photometry, spectroscopy, and radar provided robustness to our ability to assess the potential impact risk.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PSJ.....3..123R,[]
New Semiregular Variable Star Near The Wizard Nebula - Evolution of the Red Giant MACOMP_V1,"The red giant MaCoMP_V1 in Cepheus at coordinates RA (J2000) 22:49:05:49 and DEC (J2000) +57:52:41:6 is a semiregular variable star classified as SRS, number 2225960 in the AAVSO VSX database. Using the Fourier transform, the period P = 24.751(0.062)d was evaluated and, with the support of the ASAS-SN and ZTF surveys, a well-defined light curve was made. The analysis resulted in the fundamental physical parameters of MaCoMP_V1, such as the mass M = 4.97(0.38)M(Sun) and radius R = 40.5(6.7)R(Sun), with consistent values suggesting the characteristics of a semiregular red giant.

"Close, bright, and boxy: the superluminous SN 2018hti","SN 2018hti was a very nearby (z = 0.0614) superluminous supernova with an exceedingly bright absolute magnitude of -21.7 mag in r band at maximum. The densely sampled pre-maximum light curves of SN 2018hti show a slow luminosity evolution and constrain the rise time to ~50 rest-frame d. We fitted synthetic light curves to the photometry to infer the physical parameters of the explosion of SN 2018hti for both the magnetar and the CSM-interaction scenarios. We conclude that one of two mechanisms could be powering the luminosity of SN 2018hti; interaction with ~10 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of circumstellar material or a magnetar with a magnetic field of B<SUB>p</SUB>~ 1.3 × 10<SUP>13</SUP> G, and initial period of P<SUB>spin</SUB>~ 1.8 ms.

Formation and fate of low-metallicity stars in TNG50,"Low-metallicity stars give rise to unique spectacular transients and are of immense interest for understanding stellar evolution. Their importance has only grown further with the recent detections of mergers of stellar mass black holes that likely originate mainly from low-metallicity progenitor systems. Moreover, the formation of low-metallicity stars is intricately linked to galaxy evolution, in particular to early enrichment and to later accretion and mixing of lower metallicity gas. Because low-metallicity stars are difficult to observe directly, cosmological simulations are crucial for understanding their formation. Here, we quantify the rates and locations of low-metallicity star formation using the high-resolution TNG50 magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation, and we examine where low-metallicity stars end up at z = 0. We find that $20{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of stars with $Z_* 0.1\, \mathrm{Z_\odot }$ form after z = 2, and that such stars are still forming in galaxies of all masses at z = 0 today. Moreover, most low-metallicity stars at z = 0 reside in massive galaxies. We analyse the radial distribution of low-metallicity star formation and discuss the curious case of seven galaxies in TNG50 that form stars from primordial gas even at z = 0.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.3602P,[]
The 6 × 2pt method: supernova velocities meet multiple tracers,"We present a new methodology to analyse in a comprehensive way large-scale and supernova (or any other distance indicator) surveys. Our approach combines galaxy and supernova position and redshift data with supernova peculiar velocities, obtained through their magnitude scatter, to construct a 6 × 2pt analysis that includes six power spectra. The 3 × 3 correlation matrix of these spectra expresses exhaustively the information content of the surveys at the linear level. We then proceed to forecast the performance of future surveys like Legacy Survey of Space and Time and 4MOST with a Fisher matrix analysis, adopting both a model-dependent and a model-independent approach. We compare the performance of the 6 × 2pt approach to that of the traditional one using only galaxy clustering and some recently proposed combinations of galaxy and supernova data and quantify the possible gains by optimally extracting the linear information. We show that the 6 × 2pt method shrinks the uncertainty area in the $\sigma _8, \, \gamma$ plane by more than half when compared to the traditional method. The combined clustering and velocity data on the growth of structures have uncertainties at similar levels to those of the cosmic microwave background but exhibit orthogonal degeneracies, and the combined constraints yield improvements of factors of 5 or more in each of the five cosmological parameters considered here. Concerning the model-independent results, we find that our method can improve the constraints on H(z)/H<SUB>0</SUB> in all redshift bins by more than 70 per cent with respect to the galaxy clustering alone and by 30 per cent when supernova velocities (but not clustering) are considered, reaching a precision of 3-4 per cent at high redshifts.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.2841Q,[]
Progenitor and close-in circumstellar medium of type II supernova 2020fqv from high-cadence photometry and ultra-rapid UV spectroscopy,"We present observations of SN 2020fqv, a Virgo-cluster type II core-collapse supernova (CCSN) with a high temporal resolution light curve from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) covering the time of explosion; ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) starting 3.3 d post-explosion; ground-based spectroscopic observations starting 1.1 d post-explosion; along with extensive photometric observations. Massive stars have complicated mass-loss histories leading up to their death as CCSNe, creating circumstellar medium (CSM) with which the SNe interact. Observations during the first few days post-explosion can provide important information about the mass-loss rate during the late stages of stellar evolution. Model fits to the quasi-bolometric light curve of SN 2020fqv reveal 0.23 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of CSM confined within 1450 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> (10<SUP>14</SUP> cm) from its progenitor star. Early spectra (<4 d post-explosion), both from HST and ground-based observatories, show emission features from high-ionization metal species from the outer, optically thin part of this CSM. We find that the CSM is consistent with an eruption caused by the injection of ~5 × 10<SUP>46</SUP> erg into the stellar envelope ~300 d pre-explosion, potentially from a nuclear burning instability at the onset of oxygen burning. Light-curve fitting, nebular spectroscopy, and pre-explosion HST imaging consistently point to a red supergiant (RSG) progenitor with $M_{\rm ZAMS}\approx 13.5\!-\!15 \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$, typical for SN II progenitor stars. This finding demonstrates that a typical RSG, like the progenitor of SN 2020fqv, has a complicated mass-loss history immediately before core collapse.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.2777T,[]
"Discovery of extreme, roughly daily superflares on the recurrent nova V2487 Oph","V2487 Oph is a recurrent nova with detected eruptions in 1900 and 1998. Startlingly, V2487 Oph shows flares, called 'Superflares', with up to 1.10 mag amplitude, fast rises of under one-minute, always with an initial impulsive spike followed by a roughly exponential tail, typically one-hour durations, and with random event times averaging once-per-day. The typical flare energy E is over 10<SUP>38</SUP> erg, while the yearly energy budget is 10<SUP>41</SUP> erg. V2487 Oph Superflares obey three relations; the number distribution of flare energies scales as E<SUP>-2.34 ± 0.35</SUP>, the waiting time from one flare to the next is proportional to E of the first event, and flare durations scale as E<SUP>0.44 ± 0.03</SUP>. Scenarios involving gravitational energy and nuclear energy fail to satisfy the three relations. The magnetic energy scenario, however, can explain all three relations. This scenario has magnetic field lines above the disc being twisted and amplified by the motions of their footprints, with magnetic reconnection releasing energy that comes out as Superflare light. This exact mechanism is already well known to occur in white light solar flares, in ordinary M-type flare stars, and in the many Superflare stars observed all across the H-R diagram. Superflares on Superflare stars have rise times, light-curve shapes, and durations that are very similar to those on V2487 Oph. So we conclude that the V2487 Oph Superflares are caused by large-scale magnetic reconnection. V2487 Oph is now the most extreme Superflare star, exhibiting the largest known flare energy (1.6 × 10<SUP>39</SUP> erg) and the fastest occurrence rate.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.1924S,[]
Low-efficiency long gamma-ray bursts: a case study with AT2020blt,"The Zwicky Transient Facility recently announced the detection of an optical transient AT2020blt at redshift z = 2.9, consistent with the afterglow of an on-axis gamma-ray burst. However, no prompt emission was observed. We analyse AT2020blt with detailed models, showing the data are best explained as the afterglow of an on-axis long gamma-ray burst, ruling out other hypotheses such as a cocoon and a low-Lorentz factor jet. We search Fermi data for prompt emission, setting deeper upper limits on the prompt emission than in the original detection paper. Together with KONUS-Wind observations, we show that the gamma-ray efficiency of AT2020blt is $\lesssim 0.3\!-\!4.5{{\ \rm per\, cent}}$. We speculate that AT2020blt and AT2021any belong to the low-efficiency tail of long gamma-ray burst distributions that are beginning to be readily observed due to the capabilities of new observatories like the Zwicky Transient Facility.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.1391S,[]
Constraining Type Ia supernova explosions and early flux excesses with the Zwicky Transient Factory,"In the new era of time-domain surveys, Type Ia supernovae are being caught sooner after explosion, which has exposed significant variation in their early light curves. Two driving factors for early-time evolution are the distribution of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni in the ejecta and the presence of flux excesses of various causes. We perform an analysis of the largest young SN Ia sample to date. We compare 115 SN Ia light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility to the TURTLS model grid containing light curves of Chandrasekhar mass explosions with a range of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni masses, <SUP>56</SUP>Ni distributions, and explosion energies. We find that the majority of our observed light curves are well reproduced by Chandrasekhar mass explosion models with a preference for highly extended <SUP>56</SUP>Ni distributions. We identify six SNe Ia with an early-time flux excess in our gr-band data (four 'blue' and two 'red' flux excesses). We find an intrinsic rate of 18 ± 11 per cent of early flux excesses in SNe Ia at z < 0.07, based on three detected flux excesses out of 30 (10 per cent) observed SNe Ia with a simulated efficiency of 57 per cent. This is comparable to rates of flux excesses in the literature but also accounts for detection efficiencies. Two of these events are mostly consistent with circumstellar material interaction, while the other four have longer lifetimes in agreement with companion interaction and <SUP>56</SUP>Ni-clump models. We find a higher frequency of flux excesses in 91T/99aa-like events (44 ± 13 per cent).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.1317D,[]
Dust and the intrinsic spectral index of quasar variations: hints of finite stress at the innermost stable circular orbit,"We present a study of 9 242 spectroscopically confirmed quasars with multiepoch ugriz photometry from the SDSS Southern Survey. By fitting a separable linear model to each quasar's spectral variations, we decompose their five-band spectral energy distributions into variable (disc) and non-variable (host galaxy) components. In modelling the disc spectra, we include attenuation by dust on the line of sight through the host galaxy to its nucleus. We consider five commonly used attenuation laws, and find that the best description is by dust similar to that of the Small Magellanic Cloud, inferring a lack of carbonaceous grains from the relatively weak 2175-Å absorption feature. We go on to construct a composite spectrum for the quasar variations spanning 700-8000 Å. By varying the assumed power-law L<SUB>ν</SUB> ∝ ν<SUP>α</SUP> spectral slope, we find a best-fitting value α = 0.71 ± 0.02, excluding at high confidence the canonical L<SUB>ν</SUB> ∝ ν<SUP>1/3</SUP> prediction for a steady-state accretion disc with a T ∝ r<SUP>-3/4</SUP> temperature profile. The bluer spectral index of the observed quasar variations instead supports the model of Agol & Krolik, and Mummery & Balbus, in which a steeper temperature profile, T ∝ r<SUP>-7/8</SUP>, develops as a result of finite magnetically induced stress at the innermost stable circular orbit extracting energy and angular momentum from the black hole spin.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512..899W,[]
Target-of-opportunity Observations of Gravitational-wave Events with Vera C. Rubin Observatory,"The discovery of the electromagnetic counterpart to the binary neutron star (NS) merger GW170817 has opened the era of gravitational-wave multimessenger astronomy. Rapid identification of the optical/infrared kilonova enabled a precise localization of the source, which paved the way to deep multiwavelength follow-up and its myriad of related science results. Fully exploiting this new territory of exploration requires the acquisition of electromagnetic data from samples of NS mergers and other gravitational-wave sources. After GW170817, the frontier is now to map the diversity of kilonova properties and provide more stringent constraints on the Hubble constant, and enable new tests of fundamental physics. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time can play a key role in this field in the 2020s, when an improved network of gravitational-wave detectors is expected to reach a sensitivity that will enable the discovery of a high rate of merger events involving NSs (~tens per year) out to distances of several hundred megaparsecs. We design comprehensive target-of-opportunity observing strategies for follow-up of gravitational-wave triggers that will make the Rubin Observatory the premier instrument for discovery and early characterization of NS and other compact-object mergers, and yet unknown classes of gravitational-wave events.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..260...18A,[]
The GALEX-PTF Experiment. II. Supernova Progenitor Radius and Energetics via Shock-cooling Modeling,"The radius and surface composition of an exploding massive star, as well as the explosion energy per unit mass, can be measured using early ultraviolet (UV) observations of core-collapse supernovae (CC SNe). We present the results from a simultaneous Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) and Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) search for early UV emission from SNe. We analyze five CC SNe for which we obtained near-UV (NUV) measurements before the first ground-based R-band detection. We introduce SOPRANOS, a new maximum likelihood fitting tool for models with variable temporal validity windows, and use it to fit the Sapir & Waxman shock-cooling model to the data. We report four Type II SNe with progenitor radii in the range of R <SUB>*</SUB> ≍ 600-1100 R <SUB>⊙</SUB> and a shock velocity parameter in the range of v <SUB> s*</SUB> ≍ 2700-6000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> (E/M ≍ 2-8 × 10<SUP>50</SUP> erg/M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) and one Type IIb SN with R <SUB>*</SUB> ≍ 210 R <SUB>⊙</SUB> and v <SUB> s*</SUB> ≍ 11,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> (E/M ≍ 1.8 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg/M <SUB>⊙</SUB>).

Optical Observations and Modeling of the Superluminous Supernova 2018lfe,"We present optical imaging and spectroscopy of SN 2018lfe, which we classify as a Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) at a redshift of z = 0.3501 ± 0.0004 with a peak absolute magnitude of M <SUB> r </SUB> = -22.1 ± 0.1 mag, one of the brightest SLSNe discovered. SN 2018lfe was identified for follow-up using our FLEET machine-learning pipeline. Both the light curve and the spectra of SN 2018lfe are consistent with the broad population of SLSNe. We fit the light curve with a magnetar central engine model and find an ejecta mass of M <SUB>ej</SUB> ≈ 3.8 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, a magnetar spin period of P ≈ 2.9 ms, and a magnetic field strength of B <SUB>⊥</SUB> ≈ 2.8 × 10<SUP>14</SUP> G. The magnetic field strength is near the top of the distribution for SLSNe, while the spin period and ejecta mass are near the median values of the distribution for SLSNe. From late-time imaging and spectroscopy we find that the host galaxy of SN 2018lfe has an absolute magnitude of M <SUB> r </SUB> = -17.85 ± 0.24, (L <SUB> B </SUB> = 0.029 ± 0.007L*), and an inferred metallicity of Z ≈ 0.3 Z <SUB>⊙</SUB> and star formation rate of ≈0.8 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...931...32Y,[]
X-Ray Observation of the Roche-lobe-filling White Dwarf plus Hot Subdwarf System ZTF J213056.71+442046.5,"ZTF J213056.71+442046.5 is the prototype of a small class of recently discovered compact binaries composed of a white dwarf and a hot subdwarf that fills its Roche lobe. Its orbital period of only 39 minutes is the shortest known for the objects in this class. Evidence for a high orbital inclination (i = 86°) and for the presence of an accretion disk has been inferred from a detailed modeling of its optical photometric and spectroscopic data. We report the results of an XMM-Newton observation carried out on 2021 January 7. ZTF J213056.71+442046.5 was clearly detected by the Optical Monitor, which showed a periodic variability in the UV band (200-400 nm), with a light curve similar to that seen at longer wavelengths. Despite accretion on the white dwarf at an estimated rate of the order of 10<SUP>-9 </SUP> M <SUB>⊙ </SUB>yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, no X-rays were detected with the EPIC instrument, with a limit of ~10<SUP>30</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> on the 0.2-12 keV luminosity.

"Discovery of ATLAS17jrp as an Optical-, X-Ray-, and Infrared-bright Tidal Disruption Event in a Star-forming Galaxy","We hereby report the discovery of ATLAS17jrp as an extraordinary tidal disruption event (TDE) in the star-forming galaxy SDSS J162034.99+240726.5 in our recent sample of mid-infrared outbursts in nearby galaxies. Its optical/UV light curves rise to a peak luminosity of ~1.06 × 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> in about a month and then decay as t <SUP>-5/3</SUP> with a roughly constant temperature around 19,000 K, and the optical spectra show a blue continuum and very broad Balmer lines with FWHM ~ 15,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which gradually narrowed to 1400 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> within 4 yr, all agreeing well with other optical TDEs. A delayed and rapidly rising X-ray flare with a peak luminosity of ~1.27 × 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> was detected ~170 days after the optical peak. The high MIR luminosity of ATLAS17jrp (~2 × 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) has revealed a distinctive dusty environment with a covering factor as high as ~0.2, which is comparable to that of a torus in active galactic nuclei but at least one order of magnitude higher than normal optical TDEs. Therefore, ATLAS17jrp turns out to be one of the rare unambiguous TDEs found in star-forming galaxies, and its high dust-covering factor implies that dust extinction could play an important role in the absence of optical TDEs in star-forming galaxies.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930L...4W,[]
Long-term Evolution of a Supernova Remnant Hosting a Double Neutron Star Binary,"An ultra-stripped supernova (USSN) is a type of core-collapse supernova explosion proposed to be a candidate formation site of a double neutron star (DNS) binary. We investigate the dynamical evolution of an ultra-stripped supernova remnant (USSNR), which should host a DNS at its center. By accounting for the mass-loss history of the progenitor binary using a model developed by a previous study, we construct the large-scale structure of the circumstellar medium (CSM) up to a radius ~100 pc, and simulate the explosion and subsequent evolution of a USSN surrounded by such a CSM environment. We find that the CSM encompasses an extended region characterized by a hot plasma with a temperature ~10<SUP>8</SUP> K located around the termination shock of the wind from the progenitor binary (~10 pc), and the USSNR blast wave is drastically weakened while penetrating through this hot plasma. Radio continuum emission from a young USSNR is sufficiently bright to be detectable if it inhabits our galaxy but faint compared to the observed Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs), and thereafter declines in luminosity through adiabatic cooling. Within our parameter space, USSNRs typically exhibit a low radio luminosity and surface brightness compared to the known Galactic SNRs. Due to the small event rate of USSNe and their relatively short observable life span, we calculate that USSNRs account for only ~0.1%-1% of the total SNR population. This is consistent with the fact that no SNR hosting a DNS binary has been discovered in the Milky Way so far.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930..143M,[]
Evolution of a Peculiar Type Ibn Supernova SN 2019wep,"We present a high-cadence short term photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign of a type Ibn SN 2019wep, which is one of the rare SN Ibn after SNe 2010al and 2019uo to display signatures of flash ionization (He II, C III, N III). We compare the decline rates and rise time of SN 2019wep with other SNe Ibn and fast transients. The post-peak decline in all bands (0.1 mag day<SUP>-1</SUP>) are consistent with SNe Ibn but less than the fast transients. On the other hand, the Δm <SUB>15</SUB> values are slightly lower than the average values for SNe Ibn but consistent with the fast transients. The rise time is typically shorter than SNe Ibn but longer than fast transients. SN 2019wep lies at the fainter end of SNe Ibn but possesses an average luminosity among the fast transients sample. The peculiar color evolution places it between SNe Ib and the most extreme SNe Ibn. The bolometric light-curve modeling shows resemblance with SN 2019uo with ejecta masses consistent with SNe Ib. SN 2019wep belongs to the P cygni subclass of SNe Ibn and shows faster evolution in line velocities as compared to the emission subclass. The post-maximum spectra show close resemblance with ASASSN-15ed hinting it to be of SN Ib nature. The low He I CSM velocities and residual Hα further justifies it and provide evidence of an intermittent progenitor between Wolf-Rayet and LBV stars.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930..127G,[]
Wave-driven Outbursts and Variability of Low-mass Supernova Progenitors,"In a substantial number of core-collapse supernovae (SNe), early-time interaction indicates a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) that may be produced by outbursts from the progenitor star. Wave-driven mass loss is a possible mechanism to produce these signatures, with previous work suggesting that this mechanism is most effective for low-mass (~11 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) SN progenitors. Using one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with MESA, we study the effects of this wave heating in SN progenitors of masses M <SUB>ZAMS</SUB> = 10-13 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. This range encompasses stars that experience semidegenerate central neon burning and more degenerate off-center neon ignition. We find that central Ne ignition at M <SUB>ZAMS</SUB> = 11 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> produces a burst of intense wave heating that transmits ~10<SUP>47</SUP> erg of energy at 10 yr before core collapse, whereas other masses experience smaller levels of wave heating. Wave heating does not hydrodynamically drive mass loss in any of our models and is unlikely to produce a very massive CSM on its own. However, wave heating can cause large radial expansion (by more than an order of magnitude), photospheric cooling, and luminosity brightening by up to ~10<SUP>6</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> in hydrogen-poor stripped star models. Some Type Ib/c progenitors could drastically change their appearance in the final years of their lives, with brightness in the visual bands increasing by nearly 3 mag. Moreover, interaction with a close binary companion could drive intense mass loss, with implications for Type Ibn and other interaction-powered SNe.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930..119W,[]
Galactic Positrons from Thermonuclear Supernovae,"Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) may originate from a wide variety of explosion scenarios and progenitor channels. They exhibit a factor of ≈10 difference in brightness and thus a differentiation in the mass of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni → <SUP>56</SUP>Co → <SUP>56</SUP>Fe. We present a study on the fate of positrons within SNe Ia in order to evaluate their escape fractions and energy spectra. Our detailed Monte Carlo transport simulations for positrons and γ-rays include both β <SUP>+</SUP> decay of <SUP>56</SUP>Co and pair production. We simulate a wide variety of explosion scenarios, including the explosion of white dwarfs (WDs) close to the Chandrasekhar mass (M <SUB>Ch</SUB>), He-triggered explosions of sub-M <SUB>Ch</SUB> WDs, and dynamical mergers of two WDs. For each model, we study the influence of the size and morphology of the progenitor magnetic field between 1 and 10<SUP>13</SUP> G. Population synthesis based on the observed brightness distribution of SNe Ia was used to estimate the overall contributions to Galactic positrons due to escape from SNe Ia. We find that this is dominated by SNe Ia of normal brightness, where variations in the distribution of emitted positrons are small. We estimate a total SNe Ia contribution to Galactic positrons of <2% and, depending on the magnetic field morphology, <6-20% for M <SUB>Ch</SUB> and sub-M <SUB>Ch</SUB>, respectively.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930..107M,[]
A Rapid and Large-amplitude X-Ray Dimming Event in a z ≈ 2.6 Radio-quiet Quasar,"We report a dramatic, fast X-ray dimming event in a z = 2.627 radio-quiet type 1 quasar, which has an estimated supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass of 6.3 × 10<SUP>9</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. In the high X-ray state, it showed a typical level of X-ray emission relative to its UV/optical emission. Then its 0.5-2 keV (rest-frame 1.8-7.3 keV) flux dropped by a factor of ≈7.6 within two rest-frame days. The dimming is associated with spectral hardening, as the 2-7 keV (rest-frame 7.3-25.4 keV) flux dropped by only 17%, and the effective power-law photon index of the X-ray spectrum changed from ≈2.3 to ≈0.9. The quasar has an infrared (IR)-to-UV spectral energy distribution and a rest-frame UV spectrum similar to those of typical quasars, and it does not show any significant long-term variability in the IR and UV/optical bands. Such an extremely fast and large-amplitude X-ray variability event has not been reported before in luminous quasars with such massive SMBHs. The X-ray dimming is best explained by a fast-moving absorber crossing the line of sight and fully covering the X-ray emitting corona. Adopting a conservatively small size of 5 GM <SUB>BH</SUB>/c <SUP>2</SUP> for the X-ray corona, the transverse velocity of the absorber is estimated to be ≈0.9c. The quasar is likely accreting with a high or even super-Eddington accretion rate, and the high-velocity X-ray absorber is probably related to a powerful accretion-disk wind. Such an energetic wind may eventually evolve into a massive galactic-scale outflow, providing efficient feedback to the host galaxy.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930...53L,[]
SN 2020jfo: A Short-plateau Type II Supernova from a Low-mass Progenitor,"We present spectroscopic and photometric observations of the Type IIP supernova, SN 2020jfo, in ultraviolet and optical wavelengths. SN 2020jfo occurred in the spiral galaxy M61 (NGC 4303), with eight observed supernovae in the past 100 yr. SN 2020jfo exhibited a short plateau lasting < 65 days, and achieved a maximum brightness in Vband of M <SUB> V </SUB> = -17.4 ± 0.4 mag at about 8.0 ± 0.5 days since explosion. From the bolometric light curve, we have estimated the mass of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni synthesized in the explosion to be 0.033 ± 0.006 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The observed spectral features are typical for a Type IIP supernova except for shallow Hα absorption throughout the evolution and the presence of stable <SUP>58</SUP>Ni feature at 7378 Å, in the nebular phase. Using hydrodynamical modeling in the MESA + STELLA framework, an ejecta mass of ~5 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> is estimated. Models also indicate SN 2020jfo could be the result of a red supergiant progenitor with M <SUB>ZAMS</SUB> ~ 12 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Bolometric light-curve modeling revealed the presence of a secondary radiation source for initial ~20 days, which has been attributed to interaction with a circumstellar material of mass ~ 0.2 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, which most likely was ejected due to enhanced mass loss about 20 yr prior to the supernova explosion.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930...34T,[]
Characterization of Supernovae Based on the Spectral-Temporal Energy Distribution: Two Possible SN Ib Subtypes,"A quantitative data-driven comparison among supernovae (SNe) based on their spectral time series combined with multiband photometry is presented. We use an unsupervised random forest algorithm as a metric on a set of 82 well-documented SNe representing all the main spectroscopic types, in order to embed these in an abstract metric space reflecting shared correlations between the objects. We visualize the resulting metric space in 3D, revealing strong agreement with the current spectroscopic classification scheme. The embedding splits Type Ib supernovae into two groups, with one subgroup exhibiting broader, less prominent, higher-velocity lines than the other, possibly suggesting a new SN Ib subclass is required. The method could be to classify newly discovered SNe according to their distance from known event groups, or ultimately to devise a new, spectral-temporal classification scheme. Such an embedding could also depend on hidden parameters that may perhaps be physically interpretable.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930...31B,[]
"The Curious Case of ASASSN-20hx: A Slowly Evolving, UV- and X-Ray-Luminous, Ambiguous Nuclear Transient","We present observations of ASASSN-20hx, a nearby ambiguous nuclear transient (ANT) discovered in NGC 6297 by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). We observed ASASSN-20hx from -30 to 275 days relative to the peak UV/optical emission using high-cadence, multiwavelength spectroscopy and photometry. From Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data, we determine that the ANT began to brighten on 2020 June 22.8 with a linear rise in flux for at least the first week. ASASSN-20hx peaked in the UV/optical 30 days later on 2020 July 22.8 (MJD = 59052.8) at a bolometric luminosity of L = (3.15 ± 0.04) × 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The subsequent decline is slower than any TDE observed to date and consistent with many other ANTs. Compared to an archival X-ray detection, the X-ray luminosity of ASASSN-20hx increased by an order of magnitude to L <SUB> x </SUB> ~ 1.5 × 10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> and then slowly declined over time. The X-ray emission is well fit by a power law with a photon index of Γ ~ 2.3-2.6. Both the optical and near-infrared spectra of ASASSN-20hx lack emission lines, unusual for any known class of nuclear transient. While ASASSN-20hx has some characteristics seen in both tidal disruption events and active galactic nuclei, it cannot be definitively classified with current data.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930...12H,[]
The Donor of the Black Hole X-Ray Binary MAXI J1820+070,"We estimate the parameters of the donor of the accreting black hole binary MAXI J1820+070. The measured values of the binary period, rotational and radial velocities, and constraints on the orbital inclination imply the donor is a subgiant with the mass of ${M}_{2}\approx {0.49}_{-0.10}^{+0.10}{M}_{\odot }$ and the radius of ${R}_{2}\approx {1.19}_{-0.08}^{+0.08}{R}_{\odot }$ . We reanalyze the previously obtained optical spectrum from the Gran Telescopio Canarias and found it yields a strict lower limit on the effective temperature of T > 4200 K. We compile optical and infrared fluxes observed during the quiescence of this system. From the minima r- and i-band fluxes found in Pan-STARSS1 Data Release 2 prediscovery imaging and for a distance of D ≈ 3 kpc, reddening of E(B - V) = 0.23, and R <SUB>2</SUB> ≈ 1.11R <SUB>⊙</SUB>, we find T ≲ 4230 K, very close to the above lower limit. For a larger distance, the temperature can be higher, up to about 4500 K (corresponding to a K5 spectral type, preferred by previous studies) at D = 3.5 kpc, allowed by the Gaia parallax. We perform evolutionary calculations for the binary system and compare them to the observational constraints. Our model fitting the above temperature and radius constraints at D ≈ 3 kpc has a mass of 0.4M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, T ≈ 4200 K, and solar metallicity. Two alternative models require D ≳ 3.3-3.4 kpc at 0.4M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, T ≈ 4500 K and half-solar metallicity, and 0.5M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, T ≈ 4300 K, and solar metallicity. These models yield mass-transfer rates of ~10<SUP>-10</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, compatible with those based on the estimated accreted mass of ≈2 × 10<SUP>25</SUP> g and the time between the 2018 discovery and the 1934 historical outburst.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930....9M,[]
Zwicky Transient Facility and Globular Clusters: The RR Lyrae gri-band Period-Luminosity-Metallicity and Period-Wesenheit-Metallicity Relations,"Based on time-series observations collected from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), we derived period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) and period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relations for RR Lyrae located in globular clusters. We have applied various selection criteria to exclude RR Lyrae with problematic or spurious light curves. These selection criteria utilized information on the number of data points per light curve, amplitudes, colors, and residuals on the period-luminosity and/or period-Wesenheit relations. Due to blending, a number of RR Lyrae in globular clusters were found to be anomalously bright and have small amplitudes of their ZTF light curves. We used our final sample of ~750 RR Lyrae in 46 globular clusters covering a wide metallicity range (-2.36 dex < [Fe/H] < -0.54 dex) to derive PLZ and PWZ relations in the gri bands. In addition, we have also derived the period-color-metallicity and, for the first time, the period-Q-index-metallicity relations, where the Q-index is extinction-free by construction. We have compared our various relations to empirical and theoretical relations available in the literature and found a good agreement with most studies. Finally, we applied our derived PLZ relation to a dwarf galaxy, Crater II, and found that its true distance modulus should be larger than the most recent determination.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..239N,[]
Optical Characterization of Two Cataclysmic Variables: RBS 0490 and SDSS J075939.79+191417.3,"We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of two cataclysmic variables (CVs), namely RBS 0490 and SDSS J075939.79+191417.3. The optical variations of RBS 0490 have been found to occur with a period of 1.689 ± 0.001 hr, which appears to be the probable orbital period of the system. Present photometric observations of SDSS J075939.79+191417.3 confirm and refine the previously determined orbital period as 3.14240928 ± 0.00000096 hr. The presence of long-duration eclipse features in the light curves of SDSS J075939.79+191417.3 indicates that eclipses might be due to an accretion disk and bright spot. The orbital inclination of SDSS J075939.79+191417.3 is estimated to be ~78° using the eclipse morphology. The phased light-curve variations during the orbital cycle of RBS 0490 provide evidence of emission from an independent second accretion region or a second fainter pole. Optical spectra of RBS 0490 and SDSS J075939.79+191417.3 show the presence of strong Balmer and weak He II (λ4686) emission lines, along with the detection of strong Hβ emission lines with a large equivalent width. The characteristic features of RBS 0490 seem to favor low-field polars, while SDSS J075939.79+191417.3 appears to be similar to nonmagnetic systems.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..221J,[]
Limits on the Detection of Planet Nine in the Dark Energy Survey,"Studies of the clustering of the most distant Kuiper Belt objects in the outer solar system have hinted at the possible existence of a planet beyond Neptune referred to as Planet Nine (P9). Recent efforts have constrained the parameter space of the orbital elements of P9, allowing for the creation of a synthetic catalog of hypothetical P9s. By examining the potential recovery of such a catalog within numerous sky surveys, it is possible to further constrain the parameter space for P9, providing direction for a more targeted search. We examine the ability of the full six years of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to recover a synthetic Planet Nine population presented in Brown & Batygin. We find that out of 100,000 simulated objects, 11,709 cross the wide DES survey footprint of which 10,187 (87.0%) are recovered. This rules out an additional 5% of the parameter space after accounting for Planets Nine that would have been detected by both the Zwicky Transient Facility and DES.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..216B,[]
HEALPix Alchemy: Fast All-Sky Geometry and Image Arithmetic in a Relational Database for Multimessenger Astronomy Brokers,"Efficient searches for electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave, high-energy neutrino, and gamma-ray burst events demand rapid processing of image arithmetic and geometry set operations in a database to cross-match galaxy catalogs, observation footprints, and all-sky images. Here we introduce HEALPix Alchemy, an open-source, pure Python implementation of a set of methods that enables rapid all-sky geometry calculations. HEALPix Alchemy is built upon HEALPix, a spatial indexing strategy that is widely used in astronomical databases as well as the native format of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave sky localization maps. Our approach leverages new multirange types built into the PostgreSQL 14 database engine. This enables fast all-sky queries against probabilistic multimessenger event localizations and telescope survey footprints. Questions such as ""What are the galaxies contained within the 90% credible region of an event?"" and ""What is the rank-ordered list of the fields within an observing footprint with the highest probability of containing the event?"" can be performed in less than a few seconds on commodity hardware using off-the-shelf cloud-managed database implementations without server-side database extensions. Common queries scale roughly linearly with the number of telescope pointings. As the number of fields grows into the hundreds or thousands, HEALPix Alchemy is orders of magnitude faster than other implementations.

The new symbiotic star, THA 15−31, was previously described as a pre-main sequence star belonging to the Lupus 3 association. Our observations, ancillary data, and Gaia EDR3 parallax indicate that THA 15−31 is a symbiotic star composed of an M6III red giant and an accreting companion, is subject to E<SUB>B − V</SUB> = 0.38 reddening, and is located at a distance of ∼12 kpc and at 1.8 kpc above the Galactic plane in the outskirts of the Bulge. The luminosity of the accreting companion is ∼100 L<SUB>⊙</SUB>, placing THA 15−31 among the symbiotic stars accreting at a high rate (2.5 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>−1</SUP> if the accretion is occurring on a white dwarf of 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). The observed emission lines originate primarily from H I, He I, and Fe II, with no He II or other high-excitation lines observed; a sharp central absorption superimposed on the Balmer emission lines is observed, while all other lines have a simple Gaussian-like profile. The emission from the companion dominates over the M6III red giant at U and B-band wavelengths, and is consistent with an origin primarily in an optically thick accretion disk. No significant photometric variability is observed at optical or NIR wavelengths, suggesting either a face-on orbital orientation and/or that the red giant is far from Roche-lobe filling conditions. The profile of emission lines supports a low orbital inclination if they form primarily in the accretion disk. An excess emission is present in AllWISE W3 (12 μm) and W4 (22 μm) data, radiating a luminosity ≥35 L<SUB>⊙</SUB>, consistent with thermal emission from optically thin circumstellar dust.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...661A.124M,[]
Radial velocity variability and the evolution of hot subdwarf stars,"Hot subdwarf stars represent a late and peculiar stage in the evolution of low-mass stars, since they are likely formed by close binary interactions. In this work, we perform a radial velocity (RV) variability study of a sample of 646 hot subdwarfs with multi-epoch radial velocities based on spectra from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). The atmospheric parameters and RVs were taken from the literature. For stars with archival spectra but without literature values, we determined the parameters by fitting model atmospheres. In addition, we redetermined the atmospheric parameters and RVs for all the He-enriched sdO/Bs. This broad sample allowed us to study RV-variability as a function of the location in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> − log g- and T<SUB>eff</SUB> − log n(He)/n(H) diagrams in a statistically significant way. We used the fraction of RV-variable stars and the distribution of the maximum RV variations ΔRV<SUB>max</SUB> as diagnostics. Both indicators turned out to be quite inhomogeneous across the studied parameter ranges. A striking feature is the completely dissimilar behaviour of He-poor and He-rich hot subdwarfs. While the former have a high fraction of close binaries, almost no significant RV variations could be detected for the latter. This has led us to the conclusion that there is likely no evolutionary connection between these subtypes. On the other hand, intermediate He-rich- and extreme He-rich sdOB/Os are more likely to be related. Furthermore, we conclude that the vast majority of this population is formed via one or several binary merger channels. Hot subdwarfs with temperatures cooler than ∼24 000 K tend to show fewer and smaller RV-variations. These objects might constitute a new subpopulation of binaries with longer periods and late-type or compact companions. The RV-variability properties of the extreme horizontal branch (EHB) and corresponding post-EHB populations of the He-poor hot subdwarfs match and confirm the predicted evolutionary connection between them. Stars found below the canonical EHB at somewhat higher surface gravities show large RV variations and a high RV variability fraction. These properties are consistent with most of them being low-mass EHB stars or progenitors of low-mass helium white dwarfs in close binaries.",,[]

"Identification of SRGt 062340.2-265751 as a bright, strongly variable, novalike cataclysmic variable","We report the identification and follow-up of the transient SRGt 062340.2-265751 detected with both instruments on board the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma mission. Optical spectroscopy of the G = 12.5 counterpart firmly classifies the object as a novalike cataclysmic variable (CV) at a distance of 495 pc. A highly significant TESS period of 3.941 h, tentatively identified with the orbital period of the binary, could not be found when the object was reobserved with TESS two years later. The newer high-cadence TESS data revealed quasi-periodic oscillations around 25 min, while ground-based photometry indicated periodic variability at 32 min. Located in very sparsely populated regions of color-magnitude diagrams involving X-ray and optical magnitudes and colors, the new object could be an X-ray underluminous magnetic CV, an intermediate polar, or an overluminous nonmagnetic CV. The lack of uniquely identified spin and orbital periods prevents a final classification. The site of X-ray production in the system, L<SUB>X</SUB>,<SUB>bol</SUB> = 4.8 × 10<SUP>32</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, remains to be understood given its high variability on long and short timescales.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...661A..42S,[]
Identification of three cataclysmic variables detected by the ART-XC and eROSITA telescopes on board the SRG during the all-sky X-ray survey,"We report the discovery of three cataclysmic variables in the data of the first year of the all-sky X-ray survey by the SRG orbital observatory. The sources were selected for their brightness in the 4-12 keV band in the data of the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope. They are also detected by the eROSITA telescope, which provides accurate localizations and spectral data for a broadband spectral analysis. All three objects were previously known as X-ray sources from the ROSAT all-sky survey and XMM-Newton slew survey, but their nature remained unknown. The X-ray spectra obtained by eROSITA and ART-XC are consistent with optically thin thermal emission with a temperature kT ≳ 18 keV for SRGA J194638.9+704552 and SRGA J225412.8+690658 and kT ≳ 5 keV for SRGAJ204547.8+672642. Together with the inferred high X-ray luminosities (2 × 10<SUP>32</SUP>-3 × 10<SUP>33</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>), this strongly suggests that all three sources are cataclysmic variables (CVs). We have obtained optical photometry and spectroscopy for these objects using the AZT-33IK 1.6 m telescope of the Sayan Observatory. The optical properties confirm the CV nature of the objects. We conclude that SRGA J194638.9+704552 is an intermediate polar, SRGA J204547.8+672642 is likely a polar or intermediate polar, and SRGA J225412.8+690658 is either a magnetic or nonmagnetic CV. We have also measured an orbital period of 2.98 h for SRGA J204547.8+672642 based on TESS data. Three out of the planned eight SRG all-sky surveys have now been completed. We expect to find many new CVs, in particular, magnetic systems, during the survey, and we plan to continue our optical follow-up program.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...661A..39Z,[]

SRG/ART-XC discovery of SRGA J204318.2+443815: Towards the complete population of faint X-ray pulsars,"We report the discovery of the new long-period X-ray pulsar SRGA J204318.2+443815/SRGe J204319.0+443820 in a Be binary system. The source was found in the second all-sky survey by the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope on board the SRG mission. The follow-up observations with XMM-Newton, NICER, and NuSTAR allowed us to discover a strong coherent signal in the source light curve with a period of ~742 s. The pulsed fraction was found to depend on an increase in energy from ~20% in soft X-rays to >50% at high energies, as is typical for X-ray pulsars. The source has a quite hard spectrum with an exponential cutoff at high energies and a bolometric luminosity of L<SUB>X</SUB> ≃ 4 × 10<SUP>35</SUP> ergs<SUP>-1</SUP>. The X-ray position of the source is found to be consistent with the optical transient ZTF18abjpmzf, located at a distance of ~8.0 kpc. Dedicated optical and infrared observations with the RTT-150, NOT, Keck, and Palomar telescopes revealed a number of emission lines (H<SUB>a</SUB>, He I, and the Paschen and Braket series) with a strongly absorbed continuum. According to the SRG scans and archival XMM-Newton data, the source flux is moderately variable (by a factor of 4-10) on timescales of several months and years. All this suggests that SRGA J204318.2+443815/SRGe J204319.0+443820 is a new quasi-persistent low-luminosity X-ray pulsar in a distant binary system with a Be-star of the B0-B2e class. Thus the SRG observatory allowed us to unveil a hidden population of faint objects, including a population of slowly rotating X-ray pulsars in Be systems.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...661A..28L,[]
Linking the rates of neutron star binaries and short gamma-ray bursts,"Short gamma-ray bursts are believed to be produced by both binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. We use current estimates for the BNS and NSBH merger rates to calculate the fraction of observable short gamma-ray bursts produced through each channel. This allows us to constrain merger rates of a BNS to R<SUB>BNS</SUB>=38 4<SUB>-213</SUB><SUP>+431</SUP> Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> (90% credible interval), a 16% decrease in the rate uncertainties from the second Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO)-Virgo Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog. Assuming a top-hat emission profile with a large Lorentz factor, we constrain the average opening angle of gamma-ray burst jets produced in BNS mergers to ≈1 5 ° . We also measure the fraction of BNS and NSBH mergers that produce an observable short gamma-ray burst to be 0.02<SUB>-0.01</SUB><SUP>+0.02</SUP> and 0.01 ±0.01 , respectively, and find that ≳40 % of BNS mergers launch jets (90% confidence). We forecast constraints for future gravitational-wave detections given different modeling assumptions, including the possibility that BNS and NSBH jets are different. With 24 BNS and 55 NSBH observations, expected within six months of the LIGO-Virgo-Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector network operating at design sensitivity, it will be possible to constrain the fraction of BNS and NSBH mergers that launch jets with 10% precision. Within a year of observations, we can determine whether the jets launched in NSBH mergers have a different structure than those launched in BNS mergers and rule out whether ≳80 % of binary neutron star mergers launch jets. We discuss the implications of future constraints on understanding the physics of short gamma-ray bursts and binary evolution.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PhRvD.105h3004S,[]
Wayne State University's Dan Zowada Memorial Observatory: Characterization and Pipeline of a 0.5 m Robotic Telescope,"Wayne State University's Dan Zowada Memorial Observatory is a fully robotic 0.5 m telescope and imaging system located under the dark skies of New Mexico.

We have developed a software suite for image reduction, alignment and stacking, and calculation of absolute photometry in the Sloan filters used at the telescope. Our pipeline also performs image subtraction to enable photometry of objects embedded in bright backgrounds such as galaxies.

The case for space environmentalism,"The shell bound by the Karman line at a height of ~80-100 km above the Earth's surface and geosynchronous orbit at ~36,000 km is defined as the orbital space surrounding the Earth. It is within this region, and especially in low Earth orbit, where environmental issues are becoming urgent because of the rapid growth of the anthropogenic space object population, including satellite `mega-constellations'. In this Perspective, we summarize the case for considering the orbital space around the Earth as an additional ecosystem, subject to the same care and concerns, and the same broad regulations as the oceans and the atmosphere, for example. We rely on the orbital space environment by looking through it, as well as by working within it. Hence, we should consider damage to professional astronomy, public stargazing, and the cultural importance of the sky, as well as the sustainability of commercial, civic, and military activity in space. Damage to the orbital space environment has problematic features in common with other types of environmental issue. First, the observed and predicted damage is incremental and complex, with many contributors. Second, whether or not space is formally and legally seen as a global commons, the growing commercial exploitation of what may seem to be a `free' resource is in fact externalizing the true costs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022NatAs...6..428L,[]
Post maximum light and late time optical imaging polarimetry of type I superluminous supernova 2020znr,"Optical imaging polarimetry was conducted on the hydrogen poor superluminous supernova 2020znr during three phases after maximum light (≈ +34 d, +288 d, and +289 d). After instrumental and interstellar polarization correction, all measurements are consistent with null-polarization detection. Modelling the light curve with a magnetar spin-down model shows that SN2020znr has similar magnetar and ejecta parameters to other SLSNe. A comparison of the best-fitting values discussed in the literature on SN 2017egm and SN 2015bn, two hydrogen poor SLSNe showing an increase of polarization after maximum light, suggests that SN 2020znr has higher mass ejecta that may prevent access to the geometry of the inner ejecta with optical polarimetry. The combined information provided by spectroscopy and light-curve analysis of type I SLSNe may be an interesting avenue to categorize the polarization properties of this class of transients. This approach would require to expand the sample of SLSNe polarimetry data currently available with early and late time epochs new measurements.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.5948P,[]
Observationally driven Galactic double white dwarf population for LISA,"Realistic models of the Galactic double white dwarf (DWD) population are crucial for testing and quantitatively defining the science objectives of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a future European Space Agency's gravitational-wave observatory. In addition to numerous individually detectable DWDs, LISA will also detect an unresolved confusion foreground produced by the underlying Galactic population, which will affect the detectability of all LISA sources at frequencies below a few mHz. So far, the modelling of the DWD population for LISA has been based on binary population synthesis (BPS) techniques. The aim of this study is to construct an observationally driven population. To achieve this, we employ a model developed by Maoz, Hallakoun & Badenes for the statistical analysis of the local DWD population using two complementary large, multi-epoch, spectroscopic samples: the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the Supernova Ia Progenitor surveY. We calculate the number of LISA-detectable DWDs and the Galactic confusion foreground, based on their assumptions and results. We find that the observationally driven estimates yield (1) 2-5 times more individually detectable DWDs than various BPS forecasts, and (2) a significantly different shape of the DWD confusion foreground. Both results have important implications for the LISA mission. A comparison between several variations to our underlying assumptions shows that our observationally driven model is robust, and that the uncertainty on the total number of LISA-detectable DWDs is in the order of 20 per cent.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.5936K,[]
Multiwavelength radiation models for low-luminosity GRBs and the implications for UHECRs,"We study the prompt phase of low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (ll-GRBs) as potential source of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays and ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Within the internal shock model, we choose parameters for the relativistic outflow such that our representative events have observed properties similar to GRBs 980425, 100316D, and 120714B, and self-consistently calculate the full spectral and temporal properties in a leptonic synchrotron self-Compton scenario. To investigate the conditions under which inverse Compton radiation may lead to a peak in the GeV-TeV range, we vary the fraction of internal energy supplying the magnetic field. Further, we determine the maximal energies achievable for UHECR nuclei and derive constraints on the baryonic loading/typical duration by comparing to the extragalactic gamma-ray background. We find that ll-GRBs are potential targets for multiwavelength studies and in reach for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) and optical/UV instruments. For comparable sub-MeV emission and similar dynamical evolution of the outflow, weak (strong) magnetic fields induce high (low) fluxes in the VHE regime and low (high) fluxes in the optical. VHE emission may be suppressed by γγ-absorption close to the engine or interactions with the extragalactic background light for redshifts z > 0.1. For UHECRs, the maximal energies of iron nuclei (protons) can be as high as ≃10<SUP>11</SUP> GeV (10<SUP>10</SUP> GeV) if the magnetic energy density is large (and the VHE component is correspondingly weak). These high energies are possible by decoupling the production regions of UHECR and gamma-rays in our multizone model. Finally, we find basic consistency with the energy budget needed to accommodate the UHECR origin from ll-GRBs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.5823R,[]
"AT2019azh: an unusually long-lived, radio-bright thermal tidal disruption event","Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star is destroyed by a supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy, temporarily increasing the accretion rate on to the black hole and producing a bright flare across the electromagnetic spectrum. Radio observations of TDEs trace outflows and jets that may be produced. Radio detections of the outflows from TDEs are uncommon, with only about one-third of TDEs discovered to date having published radio detections. Here, we present over 2 yr of comprehensive, multiradio frequency monitoring observations of the TDE AT2019azh taken with the Very Large Array and MeerKAT radio telescopes from approximately 10 d pre-optical peak to 810 d post-optical peak. AT2019azh shows unusual radio emission for a thermal TDE, as it brightened very slowly over 2 yr, and showed fluctuations in the synchrotron energy index of the optically thin synchrotron emission from 450 d post-disruption. Based on the radio properties, we deduce that the outflow in this event is likely non-relativistic and could be explained by a spherical outflow arising from self-stream intersections or a mildly collimated outflow from accretion on to the supermassive black hole. This data set provides a significant contribution to the observational data base of outflows from TDEs, including the earliest radio detection of a non-relativistic TDE to date, relative to the optical discovery.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.5328G,[]
Sensitive Chandra coverage of a representative sample of weak-line quasars: revealing the full range of X-ray properties,"We present deeper Chandra observations for weak-line quasars (WLQs) in a representative sample that previously had limited X-ray constraints, and perform X-ray photometric analyses to reveal the full range of X-ray properties of WLQs. Only 5 of the 32 WLQs included in this representative sample remain X-ray undetected after these observations, and a stacking analysis shows that these 5 have an average X-ray weakness factor of >85. One of the WLQs in the sample that was known to have extreme X-ray variability, SDSS J1539+3954, exhibited dramatic X-ray variability again: it changed from an X-ray normal state to an X-ray weak state within ≈3 months in the rest frame. This short time-scale for an X-ray flux variation by a factor of ≳9 further supports the thick disc and outflow (TDO) model proposed to explain the X-ray and multiwavelength properties of WLQs. The overall distribution of the X-ray-to-optical properties of WLQs suggests that the TDO has an average covering factor of the X-ray emitting region of ~0.5, and the column density of the TDO can range from $N_{\rm H}\, \sim 10^{23-24}~{\rm cm}^{-2}$ to $N_{\rm H}\, rsim 10^{24}~{\rm cm}^{-2}$, which leads to different levels of absorption and Compton reflection (and/or scattering) among WLQs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.5251N,[]
What powers the radio emission in TDE AT2019dsg: A long-lived jet or the disruption itself?,"The tidal disruption event AT2019dsg was observed from radio to X-rays and was possibly accompanied by a high-energy neutrino. Previous interpretations have focused on continued injection by a central engine as the source of energy for radio emission. We show that continuous energy injection is unnecessary; the radio data can be explained by a single ejection of plasma that supplies all the energy needed. To support this assertion, we analyse the synchrotron self-absorbed spectra in terms of the equipartition model. Similar to previous analyses, we find that the energy in the radio-emitting region increases approximately ∝ t<SUP>0.7</SUP> and the length-scale of this region grows ∝ t at a rate $\simeq 0.06\, c$. This event resembles the earliest stage of a supernova remnant: because the ejected mass is much greater than the shocked external mass, its velocity remains unchanged, while the energy in shocked gas grows with time. The radio-emitting material gains energy from the outflow, not from continuing energy injection by the central object. Although energy injection from an accreting BH cannot be completely excluded, the energy injection rate is very different from the fallback luminosity, and maintaining constant outflow velocity requires fine-tuning, demanding further physical explanation. If the neutrino association is real, the energy injection needed is much greater than for the radio emission, suggesting that the detected neutrino did not arise from the radio-emitting region.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.5085M,[]
Identifying blue large amplitude pulsators from Gaia DR2 and ZTF DR3,"Blue large amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) are hot, subluminous stars undergoing rapid variability with periods of under 60 min. They have been linked with the early stages of pre-white dwarfs and hot subdwarfs. They are a rare class of variable star due to their evolutionary history within interacting binary systems and the short time-scales relative to their lifetime in which they are pulsationally unstable. All currently known BLAPs are relatively faint (15-19 mag) and are located in the Galactic plane. These stars have intrinsically blue colours but the large interstellar extinction in the Galactic plane prevents them from swift identification using colour-based selection criteria. In this paper, we correct the Gaia G-band apparent magnitude and G<SUB>BP</SUB> - G<SUB>RP</SUB> colours of 89.6 million sources brighter than 19 mag in the Galactic plane with good quality photometry combined with supplementary all-sky data totalling 162.3 million sources. Selecting sources with colours consistent with the known population of BLAPs and performing a cross-match with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) DR3, we identify 98 short period candidate variables. Manual inspection of the period-folded light curves reveals 22 candidate BLAPs. Of these targets, 6 are consistent with the observed periods and light curves of the known BLAPs, 10 are within the theoretical period range of BLAPs, and 6 are candidate high-gravity BLAPs. We present follow-up spectra of 21 of these candidate sources and propose to classify one of them as a BLAP, and tentatively assign an additional eight of them as BLAPs for future population studies.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.4971M,[]
Simulating time-varying strong lenses,"We present a self-consistent and versatile forward modelling software package that can produce time series and pixel-level simulations of time-varying strongly lensed systems. The time dimension, which needs to take into account different physical mechanisms for variability such as microlensing, has been missing from existing approaches and it is of direct relevance to time delay, and consequently H<SUB>0</SUB>, measurements and caustic crossing event predictions. Such experiments are becoming more streamlined, especially with the advent of time domain surveys, and understanding their systematic and statistical uncertainties in a model-aware and physics-driven way can help improve their accuracy and precision. Here, we demonstrate the software's capabilities by exploring the effect of measuring time delays from lensed quasars and supernovae in many wavelengths and under different microlensing and intrinsic variability assumptions. In this initial application, we find that the cadence of the observations and combining information from different wavelengths plays an important role in the correct recovery of the time delays.

Enhancement of double-close-binary quadruples,"Double-close-binary quadruples (2 + 2 systems) are hierarchical systems of four stars where two short-period binary systems move around their common centre of mass on a wider orbit. Using Gaia Early Data Release 3, we search for comoving pairs where both components are eclipsing binaries. We present eight 2 + 2 quadruple systems with inner orbital periods of <0.4 d and with outer separations of ≳1000 au. All of these systems but one are newly discovered by this work, and we catalogue their orbital information measured from their light curves. We find that the occurrence rate of 2 + 2 quadruples is 7.3 ± 2.6 times higher than what is expected from random pairings of field stars. At most a factor of ~2 enhancement may be explained by the age and metallicity dependence of the eclipsing binary fraction in the field stellar population. The remaining factor of ~3 represents a genuine enhancement of the production of short-period binaries in wide-separation (>10<SUP>3</SUP> au) pairs, suggesting a close-binary formation channel that may be enhanced by the presence of wide companions.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.3881F,[]
"An analytical, fully relativistic framework for tidal disruption event streams in Schwarzschild geometry","We present an analytical and fully relativistic framework for studying the self-intersection of tidal disruption event (TDE) streams, restricting ourselves to the Schwarzschild spacetime. By taking advantage of the closed-form solution to the geodesic equations in the Schwarzschild metric, we calculate properties of the self-intersection without numerically evaluating the geodesic equations or making any post-Newtonian approximations. Our analytical treatment also facilitates geometric definitions of the orbital semimajor axis and eccentricity, as opposed to Newtonian formulas which lead to unphysical results for highly relativistic orbits. Combined with assumptions about energy dissipation during the self-intersection shock, our framework enables the calculation of quantities such as the fraction of material unbound during the self-intersection shock, and the characteristic semimajor axes and eccentricities of the material that remains in orbit after the collision. As an example, we calculate grids of post-intersection properties in stellar and supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses for disruptions of main-sequence stars, identifying regions where no material is ejected during self-intersection (e.g. SMBH mass $\lesssim 5\times 10^6\, {\rm M_\odot }$ for $1\, {\rm M_\odot }$ stars disrupted at the tidal radius), potentially explaining the TDEs observed by SGR/eROSITA that are visible in X-rays but not optical wavelengths. We also identify parameters for which the post-intersection accretion flow has low eccentricity (e ≲ 0.6), and find that the luminosity generated by self-intersection shocks only agrees with observed trends in the relationship between light curve decay time-scales and peak luminosities over a narrow range of SMBH masses.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.3408D,[]
The role of plasma instabilities in relativistic radiation-mediated shocks: stability analysis and particle-in-cell simulations,"Relativistic radiation-mediated shocks are likely formed in prodigious cosmic explosions. The structure and emission of such shocks are regulated by copious production of electron-positron pairs inside the shock-transition layer. It has been pointed out recently that substantial abundance of positrons inside the shock leads to a velocity separation of the different plasma constituents, which is expected to induce a rapid growth of plasma instabilities. In this paper, we study the hierarchy of plasma microinstabilities growing in an electron-ion plasma loaded with pairs and subject to a radiation force. Linear stability analysis indicates that such a system is unstable to the growth of various plasma modes which ultimately become dominated by a current filamentation instability driven by the relative drift between the ions and the pairs. These results are validated by particle-in-cell simulations that further probe the non-linear regime of the instabilities, and the pair-ion coupling in the microturbulent electromagnetic field. Based on this analysis, we derive a reduced-transport equation for the particles via pitch-angle scattering in the microturbulence and demonstrate that it can couple the different species and lead to non-adiabatic compression via a Joule-like heating. The heating of the pairs and, conceivably, the formation of non-thermal distributions, arising from the microturbulence, can affect the observed shock-breakout signal in ways unaccounted for by current single-fluid models.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.3034V,[]
Accretion disc sizes from continuum reverberation mapping of AGN selected from the ZTF survey,"We present the accretion disc-size estimates for a sample of 19 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using the optical g-, r-, and i-band light curves obtained from the Zwicky Transient Facility survey. All the AGNs have reliable supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass estimates based on previous reverberation mapping measurements. The multiband light curves are cross-correlated, and the reverberation lag is estimated using the Interpolated Cross-Correlation Function method and the Bayesian method using the JAVELIN code. As expected from the disc-reprocessing arguments, the g - r band lags are shorter than the g - i band lags for this sample. The interband lags for all, but five sources, are larger than the sizes predicted from the standard Shakura Sunyaev (SS) analytical model. We fit the light curves directly using a thin disc model implemented through the JAVELIN code to get the accretion disc sizes. The disc sizes obtained using this model are on an average 3.9 times larger than the prediction based on the SS disc model. We find a weak correlation between the disc sizes and the known physical parameters, namely the luminosity and the SMBH mass. In the near future, a large sample of AGNs covering broader ranges of luminosity and SMBH mass from large photometric surveys would be helpful in a better understanding of the structure and physics of the accretion disc.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.3005J,[]
Tidal disruption events in post-starburst galaxies: the importance of a complete stellar mass function,"A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a star is destroyed by the strong tidal shear of a massive black hole (MBH). The accumulation of TDE observations over the last years has revealed that post-starburst galaxies are significantly overrepresented in the sample of TDE hosts. Here we address the post-starburst preference by investigating the decline of TDE rates in a Milky-Way like nuclear stellar cluster featuring either a monochromatic (1 $\, \mathrm{M}{\odot {}}$) or a complete, evolved stellar mass function. In the former case, the decline of TDE rates with time is very mild, and generally up to a factor of a few in 10 Gyr. Conversely, if a complete mass function is considered, a strong TDE burst over the first 0.1-1 Gyr is followed by a considerable rate drop, by at least an order of magnitude over 10 Gyr. The decline starts after a mass segregation time-scale, and it is more pronounced assuming a more top-heavy initial mass function and/or an initially denser nucleus. Our results thus suggest that the post-starburst preference can be accounted for in realistic systems featuring a complete stellar mass function, even in moderately dense galactic nuclei. Overall, our findings support the idea that starbursting galactic nuclei are characterized by a top-heavy initial mass function; we speculate that accounting for this can reconcile the discrepancy between observed and theoretically predicted TDE rates even in quiescent galaxies.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.2885B,[]
Mapping the cosmic expansion history from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA in synergy with DESI and SPHEREx,"The measurement of the expansion history of the Universe from the redshift unknown gravitational wave (GW) sources (dark GW sources) detectable from the network of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detectors depends on the synergy with the galaxy surveys having accurate redshift measurements over a broad redshift range, large sky coverage, and detectability of fainter galaxies.In this work, we explore the possible synergy of the LVK with the spectroscopic galaxy surveys, such as DESI and SPHEREx, to measure the cosmological parameters which are related to the cosmic expansion history and the GW bias parameters. We show that by using the 3D spatial cross-correlation between the dark GW sources and the spectroscopic galaxy samples, we can measure the value of Hubble constant with about $2{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ and $1.5{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ precision from LVK+DESI and LVK+SPHEREx, respectively within the 5 yr of observation time with $50{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ duty-cycle. Similarly, the dark energy equation of state can be measured with about $10{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ and $8{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ precision from LVK+DESI and LVK+SPHEREx, respectively. We find that due to the large sky coverage of SPHEREx than DESI, performance in constraining the cosmological parameters is better from the former than the latter. By combining Euclid along with DESI and SPHEREx, a marginal gain in the measurability of the cosmological parameters is possible from the sources at high redshift (z ≥ 0.9).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.2782C,[]
SN 2020kyg and the rates of faint Iax supernovae from ATLAS,"We present multiwavelength follow-up observations of the ATLAS discovered faint Iax supernova SN 2020kyg that peaked at an absolute magnitude of M<SUB>g</SUB> ≈ -14.9 ± 0.2, making it another member of the faint Iax supernova population. The bolometric light curve requires only ≈7 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni, with an ejected mass of M<SUB>ej</SUB> ~ 0.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a low kinetic energy of E ≈ 0.05 ± 0.02 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg. We construct a homogeneous volume-limited sample of 902 transients observed by ATLAS within 100 Mpc during a 3.5 yr span. Using this sample, we constrain the rates of faint Iax (M<SUB>r</SUB> ≳ -16) events within 60 Mpc at $12^{+14}_{-8}{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the SN Ia rate. The overall Iax rate, at $15^{+17}_{-9}{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the Ia rate, is dominated by the low-luminosity events, with luminous SNe Iax (M<SUB>r</SUB> ≲ -17.5) like 2002cx and 2005hk, accounting for only $0.9^{+1.1}_{-0.5}{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the Ia rate (a 2σ upper limit of approximately 3 per cent). We favour the hybrid CONe WD + He star progenitor channel involving a failed deflagration of a near Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf, expected to leave a bound remnant and a surviving secondary companion, as a candidate explanation for faint Iax explosions. This scenario requires short delay times, consistent with the observed environments of SNe Iax. Furthermore, binary population synthesis calculations have suggested rates of $1\!-\!18{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the SN Ia rate for this channel, consistent with our rate estimates.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.2708S,[]
The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO): prototype performance and prospects for transient science,"The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) is an array of wide-field optical telescopes, designed to exploit new discoveries from the next generation of gravitational wave detectors (LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA), study rapidly evolving transients, and exploit multimessenger opportunities arising from neutrino and very high energy gamma-ray triggers. In addition to a rapid response mode, the array will also perform a sensitive, all-sky transient survey with few day cadence. The facility features a novel, modular design with multiple 40-cm wide-field reflectors on a single mount. In 2017 June, the GOTO collaboration deployed the initial project prototype, with 4 telescope units, at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory (ORM), La Palma, Canary Islands. Here, we describe the deployment, commissioning, and performance of the prototype hardware, and discuss the impact of these findings on the final GOTO design. We also offer an initial assessment of the science prospects for the full GOTO facility that employs 32 telescope units across two sites.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.2405S,[]
"Filling the gap between synchronized and non-synchronized sdBs in short-period sdBV+dM binaries with TESS: TIC 137608661, a new system with a well-defined rotational splitting","TIC 137608661/TYC 4544-2658-1/FBS 0938+788 is a new sdBV+dM reflection-effect binary discovered by the TESS space mission with an orbital period of 7.21 h. In addition to the orbital frequency and its harmonics, the Fourier transform of TIC 137608661 shows many g-mode pulsation frequencies from the subdwarf B (sdB) star. The amplitude spectrum is particularly simple to interpret as we immediately see several rotational triplets of equally spaced frequencies. The central frequencies of these triplets are equally spaced in period with a mean period spacing of 270.12 s, corresponding to consecutive l = 1 modes. From the mean frequency spacing of 1.25 μHz we derive a rotation period of 4.6 d in the deep layers of the sdB star, significantly longer than the orbital period. Among the handful of sdB+dM binaries for which the sdB rotation was measured through asteroseismology, TIC 137608661 is the non-synchronized system with both the shortest orbital period and the shortest core rotation period. Only NY Vir has a shorter orbital period but it is synchronized. From a spectroscopic follow-up of TIC 137608661 we measure the radial velocities of the sdB star, determine its atmospheric parameters, and estimate the rotation rate at the surface of the star. This measurement allows us to exclude synchronized rotation also in the outer layers and suggests a differential rotation, with the surface rotating faster than the core, as found in few other similar systems. Furthermore, an analysis of the spectral energy distribution of TIC 137608661, together with a comparison between sdB pulsation properties and asteroseismic models, gives us further elements to constrain the system.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.2201S,[]
AGN light echoes and the accretion disc self-gravity limit,"Accretion disc theory predicts that an AGN disc becomes self-gravitating and breaks up into stars at an outer radius R<SUB>sg</SUB> ≃ 12 light-days, with effectively no free parameter. We present evidence that the longest observed AGN light echoes are all close to 12 d in the AGN rest frames. These observations give a stringent test of the AGN disc theory. Further monitoring should offer insight into the formation angular momentum of the gas forming the disc. For distant AGN, observed lags significantly longer than 12 d give lower limits on their redshifts.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.1992L,[]
Relentless and complex transits from a planetesimal debris disc,"This article reports quasi-continuous transiting events towards WD 1054-226 at d = 36.2 pc and V = 16.0 mag, based on simultaneous, high-cadence, multiwavelength imaging photometry using ULTRACAM over 18 nights from 2019 to 2020 March. The predominant period is 25.02 h and corresponds to a circular orbit with blackbody T<SUB>eq</SUB> = 323 K, where a planetary surface can nominally support liquid water. The light curves reveal remarkable night-to-night similarity, with changes on longer time-scales, and lack any transit-free segments of unocculted starlight. The most pronounced dimming components occur every 23.1 min - exactly the 65<SUP>th</SUP> harmonic of the fundamental period - with depths of up to several per cent, and no evident colour dependence. Myriad additional harmonics are present, as well as at least two transiting features with independent periods. High-resolution optical spectra are consistent with stable, photospheric absorption by multiple, refractory metal species, with no indication of circumstellar gas. Spitzer observations demonstrate a lack of detectable dust emission, suggesting that the otherwise hidden circumstellar disc orbiting WD 1054-226 may be typical of polluted white dwarfs, and detected only via favourable geometry. Future observations are required to constrain the orbital eccentricity, but even if periastron is near the Roche limit, sublimation cannot drive mass loss in refractory parent bodies, and collisional disintegration is necessary for dust production.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.1647F,[]
Machine learning technique for morphological classification of galaxies from SDSS. II. The image-based morphological catalogs of galaxies at 0.02<z<0.1,"We applied the image-based approach with a convolutional neural network model to the sample of low-redshifts galaxies with -24<SUP>m</SUP><M<SUB>r</SUB><-19.4<SUP>m</SUP> from the SDSS DR9. We divided it into two subsamples, SDSS DR9 galaxy dataset and Galaxy Zoo 2 (GZ2) dataset, considering them as the inference and training datasets, respectively. As a result, we created the morphological catalog of 315782 galaxies at 0.02<z<0.1, where morphological five classes and 34 detailed features (bar, rings, number of spiral arms, mergers, etc.) were first defined for 216148 galaxies (inference dataset) by the image-based CNN classifier. For the rest of galaxies the initial morphological classification was re-assigned as in the GZ2 project. Our method shows the promising performance of morphological classification attaining more 93 % of accuracy for five classes morphology prediction except the cigar-shaped (75 %) and completely rounded (83 %) galaxies. Main results are presented in the catalog of 27378 completely rounded, 59194 rounded in-between, 18862 cigar-shaped, 7831 edge-on, 23119 spiral in the inference data set of the studied SDSS sample. As for the classification of galaxies by their detailed structural morphological features, our CNN model gives the accuracy in the range of 92-99 % depending on features, a number of galaxies with the given feature in the inference dataset, and the galaxy image quality. We demonstrate that implication of the CNN model with adversarial validation and adversarial image data augmentation improves classification of smaller and fainter SDSS galaxies with m<SUB>r</SUB> <17.7.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022KosNT..28a...3V,[]

Generalised Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes in f(R) gravity,"In this manuscript, we construct generalized Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes in the context of f(R) modified theories of gravity. We consider that the matter driving the wormhole satisfies the energy conditions so that it is the effective energy-momentum tensor containing the higher-order derivatives of curvature terms that violate the null energy condition. Thus, the gravitational fluid is interpreted by the higher-order derivatives of curvature terms to represent the wormhole geometries and is fundamentally different from its counter representation in general relativity. In particular, we explore the wormhole geometries by presuming various well-known forms of Lagrangian f(R). In addition, for the seek of completeness, we discuss modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov, volume integral quantifier, and total gravitational energy.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022EPJC...82..280S,[]

The First Data Release of CNIa0.02-A Complete Nearby (Redshift <0.02) Sample of Type Ia Supernova Light Curves,"The CNIa0.02 project aims to collect a complete, nearby sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) light curves, and the SNe are volume-limited with host-galaxy redshifts z <SUB>host</SUB> < 0.02. The main scientific goal is to infer the distributions of key properties (e.g., the luminosity function) of local SNe Ia in a complete and unbiased fashion in order to study SN explosion physics. We spectroscopically classify any SN candidate detected by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) that reaches a peak brightness <16.5 mag.

The Nascent Milliquasar VT J154843.06+220812.6: Tidal Disruption Event or Extreme Accretion State Change?,"We present a detailed multiwavelength follow-up of the nuclear radio flare VT J154843.06+220812.6, hereafter VT J1548. VT J1548 was selected as a ~1 mJy radio flare in 3 GHz observations from the Very Large Array Sky Survey. It is located in the nucleus of a low-mass ( $\mathrm{log}{M}_{\mathrm{BH}}/{M}_{\odot }\sim 6$ ) host galaxy with weak or no past active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity. VT J1548 is associated with a slow rising (multiple year), bright mid-IR flare in the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer survey, peaking at ~10%L <SUB>edd.</SUB>. No associated optical transient is detected, although we cannot rule out a short, early optical flare given the limited data available. Constant late-time (~3 yr post-flare) X-ray emission is detected at ~10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The radio spectral energy distribution is consistent with synchrotron emission from an outflow incident on an asymmetric medium. A follow-up, optical spectrum shows transient, bright, high-ionization coronal line emission ([Fe X I] λ6375, [Fe X I] λ7894, [S X I I] λ7612). Transient broad Hα is also detected but without corresponding broad Hβ emission, suggesting high nuclear extinction. We interpret this event as either a tidal disruption event or an extreme flare of an AGN, in both cases obscured by a dusty torus. Although these individual properties have been observed in previous transients, the combination is unprecedented. This event highlights the importance of searches across all wave bands for assembling a sample of nuclear flares that spans the range of observable properties and possible triggers.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...929..184S,[]
Is the High-energy Neutrino Event IceCube-200530A Associated with a Hydrogen-rich Superluminous Supernova?,"The Zwicky Transient Facility follow-up campaign of alerts released by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has led to the likely identification of the transient AT2019fdr as the source of the neutrino event IC200530A. AT2019fdr was initially suggested to be a tidal disruption event in a Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy. However, the combination of its spectral properties, color evolution, and feature-rich light curve suggests that AT2019fdr may be a Type IIn superluminous supernova. In the latter scenario, IC200530A may have been produced via inelastic proton-proton collisions between the relativistic protons accelerated at the forward shock and the cold protons of the circumstellar medium. Here, we investigate this possibility and find that at most 4.6 × 10<SUP>-2</SUP> muon neutrino and antineutrino events are expected to be detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory within 394 days of discovery in the case of excellent discrimination of the atmospheric background. After correcting for the Eddington bias, which occurs when a single cosmic neutrino event is adopted to infer the neutrino emission at the source, we conclude that IC200530A may originate from the hydrogen-rich superluminous supernova AT2019fdr.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...929..163P,[]
Effects of an Immortal Stellar Population in AGN Disks,"Stars are likely embedded in the gas disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Theoretical models predict that in the inner regions of the disk, these stars accrete rapidly, with fresh gas replenishing hydrogen in their cores faster than it is burned into helium, effectively stalling their evolution at hydrogen burning. We produce order-of-magnitude estimates of the number of such stars in a fiducial AGN disk. We find numbers of order 10<SUP>2-4</SUP>, confined to the inner r <SUB>cap</SUB> ~ 3000r <SUB> s </SUB> ~ 0.03 pc. These stars can profoundly alter the chemistry of AGN disks, enriching them in helium and depleting them in hydrogen, both by order-unity amounts. We further consider mergers between these stars and other disk objects, suggesting that star-star mergers result in rapid mass loss from the remnant to restore an equilibrium mass, while star-compact object mergers may result in exotic outcomes and even host binary black hole mergers within themselves. Finally, we examine how these stars react as the disk dissipates toward the end of its life, and find that they may return mass to the disk fast enough to extend its lifetime by a factor of several and/or may drive powerful outflows from the disk. Post-AGN, these stars rapidly lose mass and form a population of stellar mass black holes around 10M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Due to the complex and uncertain interactions between embedded stars and the disk, their plausible ubiquity, and their order-unity impact on disk structure and evolution, they must be included in realistic disk models.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...929..133J,[]
EXORCISM: A Spectroscopic Survey of Young Eruptive Variables (EXor and Candidates),"We present an optical/near-IR survey of 11 variable young stars (EXors and EXor candidates) aimed at deriving and monitoring their accretion properties. About 30 optical and near-infrared spectra ( ${\mathfrak{R}}\sim 1500\mbox{--}2000$ ) were collected between 2014 and 2019 with the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). From the spectral analysis we have derived the accretion luminosity (L <SUB>acc</SUB> ) and mass accretion rate ( ${\dot{M}}_{\mathrm{acc}}$ ), the visual extinction (A <SUB>V</SUB>), the temperature and density of the permitted line formation region (T, n <SUB>H</SUB>), and the signature of the outflowing matter. Two sources (ASASSN-13db and iPTF15afq) have been observed in outburst and quiescence, three during a high level of brightness (XZ Tau, PV Cep, and NY Ori), and the others in quiescence. These latter have L <SUB>acc</SUB> and ${\dot{M}}_{\mathrm{acc}}$ in line with the values measured in classical T Tauri stars of similar mass. All sources observed more than once present L <SUB>acc</SUB> and ${\dot{M}}_{\mathrm{acc}}$ variability. The most extreme case is ASASSN-13db, for which ${\dot{M}}_{\mathrm{acc}}$ decreases by two orders of magnitude from the outburst peak in 2015 to quiescence in 2017. Also, in NY Ori L <SUB>acc</SUB> decreases by a factor 25 in one year. In 80% of the sample we detect the [O I] 6300 Å line, a tracer of mass loss. From the variability of the Hα/[O I] 6300 Å ratio, we conclude that mass accretion variations are larger than mass loss variations. From the analysis of the H I recombination lines, a correlation is suggested between the density of the line formation region, and the level of accretion activity of the source.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...929..129G,[]
MALS SALT-NOT Survey of MIR-selected Powerful Radio-bright AGN at 0 < z < 3.5,"We present results of an optical spectroscopic survey using SALT and the Nordic Optical Telescope to build a Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mid-infrared color-based, dust-unbiased sample of powerful radio-bright (>200 mJy at 1.4 GHz) active galactic nuclei (AGN) for the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS). Our sample has 250 AGN (median z = 1.8) showing emission lines, 26 with no emission lines, and 27 without optical counterparts. Overall, our sample is fainter (Δi = 0.6 mag) and redder (Δ(g-i) = 0.2 mag) than radio-selected quasars, and representative of fainter quasar population detected in optical surveys. About 20% of the sources are narrow-line AGN (NLAGN)-65% of these, at z < 0.5 are galaxies without strong nuclear emission, and 10% at z > 1.9, have emission line ratios similar to radio galaxies. The farthest NLAGN in our sample is M1513-2524 (z <SUB>em</SUB> = 3.132), and the largest radio source (size ~330 kpc) is M0909-3133 (z <SUB>em</SUB> = 0.884). We discuss in detail 110 AGN at 1.9 < z < 3.5. Despite representing the radio loudest quasars (median R = 3685), their Eddington ratios are similar to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars having lower R. We detect four C IV broad-absorption line (BAL) QSOs, all among AGN with least R, and highest black hole masses and Eddington ratios. The BAL detection rate ( <?CDATA ${4}_{-2}^{+3}$?> %) is consistent with that seen in extremely powerful (L <SUB>1.4GHz</SUB> > 10<SUP>25</SUP> W Hz<SUP>-1</SUP>) quasars.

Accretion Disk Size Measurements of Active Galactic Nuclei Monitored by the Zwicky Transient Facility,"We compile a sample of 92 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z < 0.75 with gri photometric light curves from the archival data of the Zwicky Transient Facility and measure the accretion disk sizes via continuum reverberation mapping. We employ Monte Carlo simulation tests to assess the influences of data sampling and broad emission lines and select out the sample with adequately high sampling cadences (3 days apart in average) and minimum contaminations of broad emission lines. The interband time delays of individual AGNs are calculated using the interpolated cross-correlation function, and then these delays are fitted with a generalized accretion disk model, in which interband time delays are a power function of wavelength, black hole mass, and luminosity. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is adopted to determine the best parameter values. Overall the interband time delays can be fitted with the τ ∝ λ <SUP>4/3</SUP> relation as predicted from a steady-state, optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk; however, the yielded disk size is systematically larger than expected, although the ratio of the measured to theoretical disk sizes depends on using the emissivity- or responsivity-weighted disk radius. These results are broadly consistent with previous studies, all together raising a puzzle about the ""standard"" accretion disk model.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...929...19G,[]
Modeling the GRB 170202A Fireball from Continuous Observations with the Zadko and the Virgin Island Robotic Telescopes,"We present coordinated observations of GRB 170202A carried out by the Zadko and the Virgin Island Robotic Telescopes. The observations started 59 s after the event trigger, and provided nearly continuous coverage for two days, due to the unique locations of these telescopes. We clearly detected an early rise in optical emission, followed by late optical flares. By complementing these data with archival observations, we show that GRB 170202A is well described by the standard fireball model if multiple reverse shocks are taken into account. Its fireball is evidenced as expanding within a constant-density interstellar medium, with most burst parameters being consistent with the usual ranges found in the literature. The electron and magnetic energy parameters (ϵ <SUB> e </SUB>, ϵ <SUB> B </SUB>) are orders of magnitude smaller than the commonly assumed values. We argue that the global fit of the fireball model achieved by our study should be possible for any burst, pending the availability of a sufficiently comprehensive data set. This conclusion emphasizes the crucial importance of coordinated observation campaigns of gamma-ray bursts, such as the one central to this work, to answer outstanding questions about the underlying physics driving these phenomena.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...929...16G,[]
Hubble Space Telescope Imaging of Luminous Extragalactic Infrared Transients and Variables from the Spitzer Infrared Intensive Transients Survey,"The SPitzer InfraRed Intensive Transients Survey (SPIRITS) searched for luminous infrared (IR) transients and variables in nearly 200 nearby galaxies from 2014 to 2019, using the warm Spitzer telescope at 3.6 and 4.5 μm. Among the SPIRITS variables are IR-bright objects that are undetected in ground-based optical surveys. We classify them as (1) transients, (2) periodic variables, and (3) irregular variables. The transients include eSPecially Red Intermediate-luminosity Transient Events (SPRITEs), having maximum luminosities fainter than supernovae, red IR colors, and a wide range of outburst durations (days to years). Here we report deep optical and near-IR imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) of 21 SPIRITS variables. They were initially considered SPRITE transients, but many eventually proved instead to be periodic or irregular variables as more data were collected. HST images show most of these cool and dusty variables are associated with star-forming regions in late-type galaxies, implying an origin in massive stars. Two SPRITEs lacked optical progenitors in deep preoutburst HST images; however, one was detected during eruption at J and H, indicating a dusty object with an effective temperature of ~1050 K. One faint SPRITE turned out to be a dusty classical nova.

Dependence of Pulsation Mode of Cepheids on Metallicity,"The Cepheid variables in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the Milky Way, M33, and M31 are used to examine the dependence of pulsation mode on metallicity, which was previously found in red supergiants. The initial samples of Cepheids are collected from the Cepheid catalogs identified from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, PS1, DIRECT, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, and Zwicky Transient Facility surveys. The contaminants are removed with the help of the Gaia/EDR3 astrometric information for extra galaxies or by comparing the geometric distance and the distance from the P-L relation for the Milky Way. The division of fundamental (FU) and first-overtone (1O) modes is refined according to the gap between the two modes in the P-L diagram of the objects in each galaxy. The ratio of FU/(FU+1O) is found to be 0.59, 0.60, 0.69, 0.83, and 0.85 for the SMC, the LMC, the Milky Way, M33, and M31, respectively, in order of metallicity, which confirms that the pulsation mode depends on metallicity in the way that the ratio of FU/(FU+1O) increases with metallicity. This dependence is not changed if the incompleteness of the samples is taken into account.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...928..139Z,[]
Optical to X-Ray Signatures of Dense Circumstellar Interaction in Core-collapse Supernovae,"Progenitors of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) can shed significant mass to circumstellar material (CSM) in the months to years preceding core collapse. The ensuing SN explosion launches ejecta that may subsequently collide with this CSM, producing shocks that can power emissions across the electromagnetic spectrum. In this work we explore the thermal signatures of dense CSM interaction when the CSM density profile is truncated at some outer radius. CSM with optical depth >c/v (where v is the shock velocity) will produce primarily ~blackbody optical/UV emission, whereas lower optical depth CSM will power bremsstrahlung X-ray emission. Focusing on the latter, we derive light curves and spectra of the resulting X-ray transients that include a detailed treatment of Comptonization. Due to strong photoelectric absorption, the X-ray light curve is dominated by the postinteraction phase that occurs after the shock reaches the CSM truncation radius. We treat this regime here for the first time. Using these results, we present the phase space of optical, UV, and X-ray transients as a function of CSM properties, and discuss detectability prospects. We find that ROSAT would not have been sensitive to CSM X-ray transients but that eROSITA is expected to detect many such events. Future wide-field UV missions such as the Ultraviolet Transient Astronomy Satellite will dramatically enhance sensitivity to large optical depth CSM configurations. Finally, we present a framework within which CSM properties may be directly inferred from observable features of X-ray transients. This can serve as an important tool for studying stellar mass loss using SN X-ray detections.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...928..122M,[]
PGIR 20eid (SN 2020qmp): A Type IIP Supernova at 15.6 Mpc discovered by the Palomar Gattini-IR survey,,,[]
"Aims: We present a detailed analysis of SN 2020qmp, a nearby Type IIP core-collapse supernova (CCSN) that was discovered by the Palomar Gattini-IR survey in the galaxy UGC07125 (distance of ≈15.6 ± 4 Mpc). We illustrate how the multiwavelength study of this event helps our general understanding of stellar progenitors and circumstellar medium (CSM) interactions in CCSNe. We highlight the importance of near-infrared (NIR) surveys for detections of supernovae in dusty environments.",,,[]
"Methods: We analyze data from observations in various bands: radio, NIR, optical, and X-rays. We use optical and NIR data for a spectroscopic and spectro-polarimetric study of the supernova and to model its light curve (LC). We obtain an estimate of the zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) progenitor mass from the luminosity of the [O I] doublet lines (λλ6300, 6364) normalized to the decay power of <SUP>56</SUP>Co. We also independently estimate the explosion energy and ZAMS progenitor mass through hydrodynamical LC modeling. From radio and X-ray observations, we derive the mass-loss rate and microphysical parameters of the progenitor star, and we investigate possible deviations from energy equipartition of magnetic fields and electrons in a standard CSM interaction model. Finally, we simulate a sample of CCSNe with plausible distributions of brightness and extinction, within 40 Mpc, and test what fraction of the sample is detectable at peak light by NIR surveys versus optical surveys.",,,[]
"Results: SN 2020qmp displays characteristic hydrogen lines in its optical spectra as well as a plateau in its optical LC, hallmarks of a Type IIP supernova. We do not detect linear polarization during the plateau phase, with a 3σ upper limit of 0.78%. Through hydrodynamical LC modeling and an analysis of its nebular spectra, we estimate a ZAMS progenitor mass of around 11.0 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and an explosion energy of around 0.8 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg. We find that the spectral energy distribution cannot be explained by a simple CSM interaction model, assuming a constant shock velocity and a steady mass-loss rate. In particular, the excess X-ray luminosity compared with the synchrotron radio luminosity suggests deviations from equipartition. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of NIR surveys over optical surveys for the detection of dust-obscured CCSNe in the local Universe. Specifically, our simulations show that the Wide-Field Infrared Transient Explorer will detect up to 14 more CCSNe (out of the 75 expected in its footprint) within 40 Mpc over five years than would an optical survey equivalent to the Zwicky Transient Facility.",,,[]
"Conclusions: We have determined or constrained the main properties of SN 2020qmp and its progenitor, highlighting the value of multiwavelength follow-up observations of nearby CCSNe. We have shown that forthcoming NIR surveys will enable us to improve constraints on the local CCSN rate by detecting obscured supernovae that would be missed by optical searches.",,,[]

Discovery of late-time X-ray flare and anomalous emission line enhancement after the nuclear optical outburst in a narrow-line Seyfert 1 Galaxy,"CSS J102913+404220 is an atypical narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy with an energetic optical outburst occurring co-spatially with its nucleus. We present a detailed analysis of multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic observations of this object covering a period of a decade since outburst. We detect mid-infrared (MIR) flares delayed by about two months relative to the optical outburst and with an extremely high peak luminosity of L<SUB>4.6 μm</SUB> > 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>−1</SUP>. The MIR peak luminosity is at least an order of magnitude higher than any known supernovae explosions, suggesting the optical outburst might be due to a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE). We find late-time X-ray brightening by a factor of ≳30 with respect to what is observed about 100 days after the optical outburst peak, followed by a flux fading by a factor of ∼4 within two weeks, making it one of the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with extreme variability. Despite the dramatic X-ray variability, there are no coincident strong flux variations in optical, UV, and MIR bands. This unusual variability behavior has been seen in other highly accreting AGNs and could be attributed to absorption variability. In this scenario, the decrease in the covering factor of the absorber with accretion rate could cause the X-ray brightening, possibly induced by the TDE. Most strikingly, while the UV/optical continuum remains almost unchanged with time, an evident enhancement in the flux of the Hα broad emission line is observed about a decade after the nuclear optical outburst, which is an anomalous behavior never seen in any other AGN. Such an Hα anomaly could be explained by the replenishment of gas clouds and excitation within the broad line region (BLR) that perhaps originates from its interaction with outflowing stellar debris. Our results highlight the importance of the late-time evolution of a TDE, which can affect the accreting properties of the AGN, as suggested by recent simulations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...660A.119Z,[]
"WD 1145+017: Alternative models of the atmosphere, dust clouds, and gas rings",Context. WD 1145+017 (WD1145) is the first white dwarf known to be orbited by disintegrating exoasteroids. It is a DBZ-type white dwarf with strongly variable broad circumstellar lines and variable shallow ultraviolet (UV) transits. Various models of the dust clouds and gaseous rings have been proposed as an explanation for this behavior.,,[]
"Aims: We aim to revisit these observations and propose alternative or modified models of the atmosphere of this white dwarf, its dust clouds, and gas rings.",,,[]
"Methods: The simple radiative transfer code Shellspec was modified for this purpose and used for testing the new dust cloud and gas disk models. We used modified TLUSTY and SYNSPEC codes to calculate atmosphere models assuming the local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) or nonLTE (NLTE), and to calculate the intrinsic spectrum of the star. We then used these atmosphere models to estimate the mass of the radiative and convective zones and NLTE spectrum synthesis to estimate their chemical composition.",,,[]
"Results: We offer an alternative explanation of some (not all) shallow UV transits. These may be naturally caused by the optical properties of the dust grains: opacities and mainly phase functions as a result of the forward scattering. The latter is much stronger in UV compared to the optical region, leaving more UV photons in the original direction during the transit. We also developed an alternative model of the gaseous disk, consisting of an inner, hotter, and almost circular disk and an outer, cooler, and eccentric disk. The structure precesses with a period of 3.83 ± 0.12 yr. We demonstrate that it fits the observed circumstellar lines reasonably well. These alternative models solve a few drawbacks that might be associated with the previous models, but they also have their own disadvantages. We confirm that the chemical composition of the atmosphere is similar to that of CI chondrites but carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur are significantly underabundant and much closer to the bulk Earth composition. This is a strong argument that the star has recently encountered and accreted material from a body of Earth-like composition.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...660A..72B,,[]
"Neutron Stars with Baryon Number Violation, Probing Dark Sectors","The neutron lifetime anomaly has been used to motivate the introduction of new physics with hidden-sector particles coupled to baryon number, and on which neutron stars provide powerful constraints.

V0644 Ser: An Active Ultrashort Period Contact Binary Star,"The photometric solutions of the ultrashort period close binary V0644 Ser based on our new complete BVRI light curves are derived by the Wilson-Devininney code. The results show that V0644 Ser is a W-type shallow contact binary, and the third light was found in the R and I bands. Compared with the light curves in 2011, the amplitude variation of the secondary maximum can be explained by the temperature change from hot to cold in the local region of the star surface caused by magnetic activity or convective instability. Combined with the Gaia parallax, the absolute parameters of this system are obtained: M <SUB>1</SUB> = 0.29(4) M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, M <SUB>2</SUB> = 0.56(9) M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, R <SUB>1</SUB> = 0.48(3) R <SUB>⊙</SUB>, R <SUB>2</SUB> = 0.65(3) R <SUB>⊙</SUB>, L <SUB>1</SUB> = 0.11(2) L <SUB>⊙</SUB>, L <SUB>2</SUB> = 0.16(2) L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. To study the period variation, we fitted the SuperWASP, CSS, ASAS-SN and ZTF survey timing data to obtain light minima times spanning 14 yr. Through O - C analysis, we find that the orbital period of this system has a long-term period decrease and periodic oscillation. The long-term period decrease can be explained by the mass transfer from more-massive component to less one and angular momentum loss via magnetic stellar wind. With the period decrease, this system is evolving from the present shallow contact phase to a relatively deeper stage predicted by the thermal relaxation oscillation theory. Periodic oscillation can be explained by the light-time effect of the cool third body. This third body may play an important role in the early formation and evolution of the binary system by removing angular momentum.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022RAA....22c5024X,[]
Physical Properties of 29 sdB+dM Eclipsing Binaries in Zwicky Transient Facility,"The development of large-scale time-domain surveys provides an opportunity to study the physical properties as well as the evolutionary scenario of B-type subdwarfs (sdBs) and M-type dwarfs (dMs). Here, we obtained 33 sdB+dM eclipsing binaries based on the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) light curves and Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) parallaxes. By using the PHOEBE code for light curve analysis, we obtain probability distributions for parameters of 29 sdB+dMs. R <SUB>1</SUB>, R <SUB>2</SUB> and i are well determined, and the average uncertainty of mass ratio q is 0.08. Our parameters are in good agreement with previous works if a typical mass of sdB is assumed. Based on parameters of 29 sdB+dMs, we find that both the mass ratio q and the companion's radius R <SUB>2</SUB> decrease with the shortening of the orbital period. For the three sdB+dMs with orbital periods less than 0.075 days, their companions are all brown dwarfs. The masses and radii of the companions satisfy the mass-radius relation for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Companions with radii between 0.12 R <SUB>⊙</SUB> and 0.15 R <SUB>⊙</SUB> seem to be missing in the observations. As more short-period sdB+dM eclipsing binaries are discovered and classified in the future with ZTF and Gaia, we will have more information to constrain the evolutionary ending of sdB+dMs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022RAA....22c5022D,[]
New Massive Contact Twin Binary in a Radio-quiet H II Region Associated with the M17 Complex,"Early-B stars, much less energetic than O stars, may create an H II region that appears as radio-quiet. We report the identification of new early-B stars associated with the radio-quiet H II region G014.645-00.606 in the M17 complex. The radio-quiet H II region G014.645-00.606 is adjacent to three radio-quiet WISE H II region candidates. The ionizing sources of the radio-quiet H II regions are expected to be later than B1V, given the sensitivity about 1-2 mJy of the MAGPIS 20 cm survey. The stars were first selected if their parallaxes of Gaia EDR3 match that of the 22 GHz H<SUB>2</SUB>O maser source within the same region. We used the color-magnitude diagram made from the Zwicky Transient Facility photometric catalog to select the candidates for massive stars because the intrinsic g - r colors of massive stars change little from B-type to O-type stars. Five stars lie in the areas of the color-magnitude diagram where either reddened massive stars or evolved post-main sequence stars of lower masses are commonly found. Three of the five stars, sources 1, 2, and 3, are located at the cavities of the three IR bubbles, and extended Hα emission is detected around the three IR bubbles. We suggest that sources 1, 2, and 3 are candidates for early-B stars associated with the radio-quiet region G014.645-00.606. Particularly, source 1 is an EW type eclipsing binary with a short period of 0.825 day, while source 2 is an EA type eclipsing binary with a short period of 0.919 day. The physical parameters of the two binary systems have been derived through the PHOEBE model. Source 1 is a twin binary of two stars with T <SUB>eff</SUB> ≈ 23,500 K, and source 2 contains a hotter component (T <SUB>eff</SUB> ≈ 20,100 K) and a cooler one (T <SUB>eff</SUB> ≈ 15,500 K). The O - C values of source 1 show a trend of decline, implying that the period of the source is deceasing. Source 1 is likely a contact early-B twin binary, for which mass transfer might cause its orbit to shrink.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022RAA....22c5021Y,[]
The Population of Interstellar Objects Detectable with the LSST and Accessible for In Situ Rendezvous with Various Mission Designs,"The recently discovered population of interstellar objects presents us with the opportunity to characterize material from extrasolar planetary and stellar systems up close. The forthcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide an unprecedented increase in sensitivity to these objects compared to the capabilities of currently operational observational facilities. We generate a synthetic population of 'Oumuamua-like objects drawn from their galactic kinematics and identify the distribution of impact parameters, eccentricities, hyperbolic velocities, and sky locations of objects detectable with the LSST, assuming no cometary activity. This population is characterized by a clustering of trajectories in the direction of the solar apex and antiapex, centered at orbital inclinations of ~90°. We identify the ecliptic or solar apex as the optimal sky location to search for future interstellar objects as a function of survey limiting magnitude. Moreover, we identify the trajectories of detectable objects that will be reachable for in situ rendezvous with a dedicated mission with the capabilities of the forthcoming Comet Interceptor or proposed Bridge concept. By scaling our fractional population statistics with the inferred spatial number density, we estimate that the LSST will detect of order ~15 interstellar objects over the course of its ~10 yr observational campaign. Furthermore, we find that there should be ~1-3 and ~0.0007-0.001 reachable targets for missions with propulsion capabilities comparable to Bridge and Comet Interceptor, respectively. These numbers are lower limits and will be readily updateable when the number density and size-frequency distribution of interstellar objects are better constrained.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PSJ.....3...71H,[]
"Low-cost Access to the Deep, High-cadence Sky: the Argus Optical Array","New mass-produced, wide-field, small-aperture telescopes have the potential to revolutionize ground-based astronomy by greatly reducing the cost of collecting area. In this paper, we introduce a new class of large telescope based on these advances: an all-sky, arcsecond-resolution, 1000 telescope array which builds a simultaneously high-cadence and deep survey by observing the entire sky all night. As a concrete example, we describe the Argus Array, a 5 m-class telescope with an all-sky field of view and the ability to reach extremely high cadences using low-noise CMOS detectors. Each 55 GPix Argus exposure covers 20% of the entire sky to m <SUB> g </SUB> = 19.6 each minute and m <SUB> g </SUB> = 21.9 each hour; a high-speed mode will allow sub-second survey cadences for short times. Deep coadds will reach m <SUB> g </SUB> = 23.6 every five nights over 47% of the sky; a larger-aperture array telescope, with an étendue close to the Rubin Observatory, could reach m <SUB> g </SUB> = 24.3 in five nights. These arrays can build two-color, million-epoch movies of the sky, enabling sensitive and rapid searches for high-speed transients, fast-radio-burst counterparts, gravitational-wave counterparts, exoplanet microlensing events, occultations by distant solar system bodies, and myriad other phenomena. An array of O(1000) telescopes, however, would be one of the most complex astronomical instruments yet built. Standard arrays with hundreds of tracking mounts entail thousands of moving parts and exposed optics, and maintenance costs would rapidly outpace the mass-produced-hardware cost savings compared to a monolithic large telescope. We discuss how to greatly reduce operations costs by placing all optics in thermally controlled, sealed domes with only a few moving parts. Coupled with careful software scope control and use of existing pipelines, we show that the Argus Array could become the deepest and fastest Northern sky survey, with total costs in the $20M range.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134c5003L,[]
Discovery of hot subdwarfs covered with helium-burning ash,"Helium-rich subdwarf O stars (sdOs) are hot compact stars in a pre-white dwarf evolutionary state. Most of them have effective temperatures and surface gravities in the range T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 40 000-50 000 K and log g = 5.5-6.0. Their atmospheres are helium dominated. If present at all, C, N, and O are trace elements. The abundance patterns are explained in terms of nucleosynthesis during single star evolution (late helium core flash) or a binary He-core white dwarf merger. Here we announce the discovery of two hot hydrogen-deficient sdOs (PG1654+322 and PG1528+025) that exhibit unusually strong carbon and oxygen lines. A non-LTE model atmosphere analysis of spectra obtained with the Large Binocular Telescope and by the LAMOST survey reveals astonishingly high abundances of C ($\approx 20{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$) and O ($\approx 20{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$) and that the two stars are located close to the helium main sequence. Both establish a new spectroscopic class of hot H-deficient subdwarfs (CO-sdO) and can be identified as the remnants of a He-core white dwarf that accreted matter of a merging low-mass CO-core white dwarf. We conclude that the CO-sdOs represent an alternative evolutionary channel creating PG1159 stars besides the evolution of single stars that experience a late helium-shell flash.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511L..66W,[]

The multiple images and their time delayed and magnified fluxes may be unresolved, however, blended into a single light curve. We demonstrate methods without a fixed source template matching for extracting the individual images, determining whether there are one (no lensing) or two or four (lensed) images, and measuring the time delays between them that are valuable cosmological probes. We find 100 per cent success for determining the number of images for time delays greater than ~10 d.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.1210D,[]
Supernova siblings and their parent galaxies in the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey,"Supernova (SN) siblings - two or more SNe in the same parent galaxy - are useful tools for exploring progenitor stellar populations as well as properties of the host galaxies such as distance, star-formation rate, dust extinction, and metallicity. Since the average SN rate for a Milky Way-type galaxy is just one per century, a large imaging survey is required to discover an appreciable sample of SN siblings. From the wide-field Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey (which aims for spectroscopic completeness for all transients which peak brighter than r < 18.5 mag) we present 10 SN siblings in five parent galaxies. For each of these families, we analyse the SN's location within the host and its underlying stellar population, finding agreement with expectations that SNe from more massive progenitors are found nearer to their host core and in regions of more active star formation. We also present an analysis of the relative rates of core collapse and thermonuclear SN siblings, finding a significantly lower ratio than past SN sibling samples due to the unbiased nature of the ZTF.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511..241G,[]
TOI-530b: a giant planet transiting an M-dwarf detected by TESS,"We report the discovery of TOI-530b, a transiting Saturn-like planet around an M0.5V dwarf, delivered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The host star is located at a distance of 147.7 ± 0.6 pc with a radius of R<SUB>*</SUB> = 0.54 ± 0.03 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a mass of M<SUB>*</SUB> = 0.53 ± 0.02 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We verify the planetary nature of the transit signals by combining ground-based multiwavelength photometry, high-resolution spectroscopy from SPIRou as well as high-angular-resolution imaging. With V = 15.4 mag, TOI-530b is orbiting one of the faintest stars accessible by ground-based spectroscopy.

TOI-530b is the sixth transiting giant planet hosted by an M-type star, which is predicted to be infrequent according to core accretion theory, making it a valuable object to further study the formation and migration history of similar planets. Furthermore, we identify a potential dearth of hot massive giant planets around M-dwarfs with separation distance smaller than 0.1 au and planet-to-star mass ratio between 2 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> and 10<SUP>-2</SUP>. We also find a possible correlation between hot giant planet formation and the metallicity of its parent M-dwarf.

SkyMapper colours of Seyfert galaxies and changing-look AGN - II. Newly discovered changing-look AGN,"Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGN) are AGN that change type as their broad emission lines appear or disappear, which is usually accompanied by strong flux changes in their blue featureless continuum. We search for turn-on CLAGN by selecting type-2 AGN from the spectroscopic Six-degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS), whose colours, observed ~15 yr later by the SkyMapper Southern Survey, are suggestive of type-1 AGN. Starting from 1092 type-2 AGN, we select 20 candidates for follow-up and confirm that 14 of them have changed into type-1 and are thus turn-on CLAGN; further observations reveal 11 more turn-on CLAGN. While our search was not tailored to efficiently discover turn-off CLAGN, we discover two such cases as well. The result suggests a turn-on CLAGN rate of over 3 per cent over ~15 yr and imply a total CLAGN rate of more than ~6 per cent over this period. Finally, we present observations of AGN that are atypical for the CLAGN phenomenology, including J1109146 - a type-1 that did not appear as an AGN at all in 6dFGS; J1406507 - the second reported changing-look narrow-line Seyfert 1; and J1340153 - a CLAGN with a change time-scale of 3 months.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511...54H,[]

Type Ia supernova magnitude step from the local dark matter environment,"Residuals in the Hubble diagram at optical wavelengths and host galaxy stellar mass are observed to correlate in type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) ('magnitude step'). Among possible progenitor channels for the associated explosions, those based on dark matter (DM) have attracted significant attention, including our recent proposal that 'normal' SNe Ia from bare detonations in sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarf stars are triggered by the passage of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs): the magnitude step could then originate from a brightness dependence on stellar properties, on DM properties, or both. Here, we present a method to estimate the local DM density and velocity dispersion of the environment of SN Ia progenitors. We find a luminosity step of $0.52\pm 0.11\,$ mag corresponding to bins of high versus low DM density in a sample of 222 low-redshift events from The Open Supernova Catalog. We investigate whether the magnitude step can be attributed to local DM properties alone, assuming asteroid-mass PBHs. Given the inverse correlation between SN Ia brightness and PBH mass, an intriguing explanation is a spatially inhomogeneous PBH mass function. If so, a strong mass segregation in the DM density-dependent PBH mass scale is needed to explain the magnitude step. While mass segregation is observed in dense clusters, it is unlikely to be realized on galactic scales. Therefore, if DM consists of asteroid-mass PBHs, the magnitude step is more likely to exist, and dominantly to be attributed to local stellar properties.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.4779S,[]
Optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of Nova V2891 Cygni: evidence for shock-induced dust formation,"We present multi-epoch optical and near-infrared observations of the highly reddened, Fe II class slow Nova V2891 Cygni. The observations span 15 months since its discovery. The initial rapid brightening from quiescence, and the presence of an ~35-d long pre-maximum halt, is well documented. The evidence that the current outburst of V2891 Cyg has undergone several distinct episodes of mass ejection is seen through time-varying P Cygni profiles of the O I 7773 Å line. A highlight is the occurrence of a dust formation event centred around approximately +273 d, which coincides with a phase of coronal line emission. The dust mass is found to be $\sim\!{0.83{-}1.25} \times 10^{-10}\ \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$. There is strong evidence to suggest that the coronal lines are created by shock heating rather than by photoionization. The simultaneous occurrence of the dust and coronal lines (with varying velocity shifts) supports the possibility that dust formation is shock induced. Such a route for dust formation has not previously been seen in a nova, although the mechanism has been proposed for dust formation in some core-collapse supernovae. Analysis of the coronal lines indicates a gas mass and temperature of 8.35-8.42 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and ~(4.8-9.1) × 10<SUP>5</SUP> K, respectively, and an overabundance of aluminium and silicon.

Accretion-induced merger leading to core-collapse supernovae in old stellar populations,"We examine a triple-star evolution that might lead to core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) in stellar populations that are too old to allow for single or binary evolution to form CCSNe, i.e. where the most massive stars that evolve off the main sequence have masses of $\simeq 4\!-\!5\, {\rm M}_\odot$. In the scenario we examine the most massive star in the triple system, of mass $\simeq 4\!-\!5\, {\rm M}_\odot$, transfers mass to an inner binary system at an orbital separation of $\simeq 100\!-\!1000\, {\rm R}_\odot$. The initial orbital separation of the inner binary is $\simeq 10\!-\!50\, {\rm R}_\odot$. The inner binary accretes most of the mass that the primary star loses and the two stars expand and their mutual orbit contracts until merger. The merger product is a main-sequence star of mass $\simeq 8\!-\!10\, {\rm M}_\odot$ that later experiences a CCSN explosion and leaves a neutron star (NS) remnant, bound or unbound to the white dwarf (WD) remnant of the primary star. We estimate the event rate of this WD-NS reverse evolution scenario to be a fraction of ≈5 × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> of all CCSNe. We expect that in the coming decade sky surveys will detect one to five such events.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.4242B,[]
Transients from ONe white dwarf - neutron star/black hole mergers,"We conduct the first 3D hydrodynamic simulations of oxygen-neon white dwarf-neutron star/black hole mergers (ONe WD-NS/BH mergers). Such mergers constitute a significant fraction, and may even dominate, the inspiral rates of all WD-NS binaries. We post-process our simulations to obtain the nuclear evolution of these systems and couple the results to a supernova spectral synthesis code to obtain the first light curves and spectra for these transients. We find that the amount of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni synthesized in these mergers grows as a strong function of the WD mass, reaching typically 0.05 and up to $0.1\, {\rm M}_\odot$ per merger. Photodisintegration leads to similar amounts of <SUP>4</SUP>He and about a ten times smaller amount of <SUP>1</SUP>H. The nuclear yields from these mergers, in particular those of <SUP>55</SUP>Mn, may contribute significantly to Galactic chemical evolution. The transients expected from ONe WD-NS mergers are dominantly red/infrared, evolve on month-long time-scales and reach bolometric magnitudes of up to -16.5. The current surveys must have already detected these transients or are, alternatively, putting strong constraints on merger scenarios. The properties of the expected transients from WD-NS mergers best agree with faint type Iax supernovae. The Vera Rubin Observatory (LSST) will be detecting up to thousands of merging ONe WD-NS systems per year. We simulate a subset of our models with 2D axisymmetric FLASH code to investigate why they have been challenging for previous studies. We find that the likely main challenge has been effectively modelling the nuclear statistical equilibrium regime in such mergers.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.3758B,[]
Identifying RR Lyrae in the ZTF DR3 data set,"We present an RR Lyrae (RRL) catalogue based on the combination of the third data release of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF DR3) and Gaia EDR3. We use a multistep classification pipeline relying on the Fourier decomposition fitting to the multiband ZTF light curves and random forest classification. The resulting catalogue contains 71 755 RRLs with period and light-curve parameter measurements and has a completeness of 0.92 and a purity of 0.92 with respect to the Specific Objects Study Gaia DR2 RRLs. The catalogue covers the Northern sky with declination ≥-28°, its completeness is ≳0.8 for heliocentric distance ≤80 kpc, and the most distant RRL is at 132 kpc. Compared with several other RRL catalogues covering the Northern sky, our catalogue has more RRLs around the Galactic halo and is more complete at low-Galactic latitude areas. Analysing the spatial distribution of RRL in the catalogue reveals the previously known major overdensities of the Galactic halo, such as the Virgo overdensity and the Hercules-Aquila Cloud, with some evidence of an association between the two. We also analyse the Oosterhoff fraction differences throughout the halo, comparing it with the density distribution, finding increasing Oosterhoff I fraction at the elliptical radii between 16 and 32 kpc and some evidence of different Oosterhoff fractions across various halo substructures.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.3575H,[]
"A multi-method approach to constrain the age of eruption and post-depositional processes in a Lower Jurassic ignimbrite from the Marifil Volcanic Complex, eastern North Patagonian Massif","In the eastern North Patagonian Massif, the Marifil Volcanic Complex corresponds to an Early Jurassic magmatic event. In this study, we evaluate new geochronological and thermochronological data obtained from an ignimbrite of the complex. U-Pb zircon ages from the pumice fraction reveal a Concordia age of 184.4 ± 1.1 Ma. Conversely, U-Pb zircon ages from the whole-rock sample evidence a Concordia age of 190.4 ± 0.6 Ma. Fission track techniques were applied on the same whole-rock sample. Zircon fission track performed on the same zircon-crystals dated by U-Pb yielded an age of 172.5 ± 8.1 Ma, while apatite fission track evidenced a cooling age of 179.1 ± 13.5 Ma. Apatite and zircon crystals describe uniform morphologies with unaltered euhedral to subhedral grains and well-developed crystalline forms. The results suggest that the age of eruption and deposition of the ignimbrite is better explained by the pumice zircon age rather than the whole-rock zircon age. Inherited grain-ages and petrographic evidence support provenance from older, probably cogenetic, magmatic products. Fission track ages reflect a post-depositional process probably related to diagenetic mineral changes.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JSAES.11403688G,[]
J/ψ polarization in semi-inclusive DIS at low and high transverse momentum,"We study the polar and azimuthal decay angular distributions of J/ψ mesons produced in semi-inclusive, deep-inelastic electron-proton scattering. For the description of the quarkonium formation mechanism, we adopt the framework of nonrelativistic QCD, with the inclusion of the intermediate color-octet channels that are suppressed at most by a factor v<SUP>4</SUP> in the velocity parameter v relative to the leading color-singlet channel. We put forward factorized expressions for the helicity structure functions in terms of transverse momentum dependent gluon distributions and shape functions, which are valid when the J/ψ transverse momentum is small with respect to the hard scale of the process. By requiring that such expressions correctly match with the collinear factorization results at high transverse momentum, we determine the perturbative tails of the shape functions and find them to be independent of the J/ψ polarization. In particular, we focus on the cos 2ϕ azimuthal decay asymmetry, which originates from the distribution of linearly polarized gluons inside an unpolarized proton. We therefore suggest a novel experiment for the extraction of this so-far unknown parton density that could be performed, in principle, at the future Electron-Ion Collider.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JHEP...03..037D,[]
"Linking Extragalactic Transients and Their Host Galaxy Properties: Transient Sample, Multiwavelength Host Identification, and Database Construction","Understanding the preferences of transient types for host galaxies with certain characteristics is key to studies of transient physics and galaxy evolution, as well as to transient identification and classification in the LSST era. Here we describe a value-added database of extragalactic transients-supernovae, tidal disruption events, gamma-ray bursts, and other rare events-and their host galaxy properties. Based on reported coordinates, redshifts, and host galaxies (if known) of events, we cross-identify their host galaxies or most likely host candidates in various value-added or survey catalogs, and compile the existing photometric, spectroscopic, and derived physical properties of the host galaxies in these catalogs. This new database covers photometric measurements from the far-ultraviolet to mid-infrared. Spectroscopic measurements and derived physical properties are also available for a smaller subset of hosts. For our 36,333 unique events, we have cross-identified 13,753 host galaxies using host names, plus 4480 using host coordinates. Besides those with known hosts, there are 18,100 transients with newly identified host candidates. This large database will allow explorations of the connections of transients to their hosts, including a path toward transient alert filtering and probabilistic classification based on host properties.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..259...13Q,[]
A Catalog of LAMOST Variable Sources Based on Time-domain Photometry of ZTF,"The identification and analysis of different variable sources is a hot topic in astrophysical research. The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) spectroscopic survey has accumulated a mass of spectral data but contains no information about variable sources. Although a few related studies present variable source catalogs for the LAMOST, the studies still have a few deficiencies regarding the type and number of variable sources identified. In this study, we present a statistical modeling approach to identify variable source candidates. We first cross-match the Kepler, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and Zwicky Transient Facility catalogs to obtain light-curve data of variable and nonvariable sources. The data are then modeled statistically using commonly used variability parameters. Then, an optimal variable source identification model is determined using the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and four credible evaluation indices such as precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Based on this identification model, a catalog of LAMOST variable sources (including 631,769 variable source candidates with a probability greater than 95%, and so on) is obtained. To validate the correctness of the catalog, we perform a two-by-two cross-comparison with the Gaia catalog and other published variable source catalogs. We achieve the correct rate ranging from 50% to 100%. Among the 123,756 sources cross-matched, our variable source catalog identifies 85,669 with a correct rate of 69%, which indicates that the variable source catalog presented in this study is credible.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..259...11X,[]
AT 2019avd: A Tidal Disruption Event with a Two-phase Evolution,"Tidal disruption events (TDEs) can uncover the quiescent supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies and also offer a promising method to study them. After the disruption of a star by an SMBH, the highly elliptical orbit of the debris stream will be gradually circularized due to the self-crossing, and then the circularized debris will form an accretion disk. The recent TDE candidate AT 2019avd has double peaks in its optical light curve, and the X-ray emerges near the second peak. The durations of the peaks are ~400 and 600 days, respectively, and the separation between them is ~700 days. We fit its spectral energy distribution and analyze its light curves in the optical/UV, mid-infrared, and X-ray bands. We find that this source can be interpreted as a two-phase scenario in which the first phase is dominated by the stream circularization, and the second phase is the delayed accretion. We use the succession of the self-crossing model and delayed accretion model to fit the first and second peaks, respectively. The fitting result implies that AT 2019avd can be interpreted by the partial disruption of a 0.9 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> star by a 7 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> SMBH, but this result is sensitive to the stellar model. Furthermore, we find that the large-amplitude (by factors up to ~5) X-ray variability in AT 2019avd can be interpreted as the rigid-body precession of the misaligned disk due to the Lense-Thirring effect of a spinning SMBH, with a precession period of 10-25 days.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...928...63C,[]
"New Variable Hot Subdwarf Stars Identified from Anomalous Gaia Flux Errors, Observed by TESS, and Classified via Fourier Diagnostics","Hot subdwarf stars are mostly stripped red giants that can exhibit photometric variations due to stellar pulsations, eclipses, the reflection effect, ellipsoidal modulation, and Doppler beaming. Detailed studies of their light curves help constrain stellar parameters through asteroseismological analyses or binary light-curve modeling and generally improve our capacity to draw a statistically meaningful picture of this enigmatic stage of stellar evolution. From an analysis of Gaia DR2 flux errors, we have identified around 1200 candidate hot subdwarfs with inflated flux errors for their magnitudes-a strong indicator of photometric variability. As a pilot study, we obtained 2 minute cadence TESS Cycle 2 observations of 187 candidate hot subdwarfs with anomalous Gaia flux errors. More than 90% of our targets show significant photometric variations in their TESS light curves. Many of the new systems found are cataclysmic variables, but we report the discovery of several new variable hot subdwarfs, including HW Vir binaries, reflection-effect systems, pulsating sdBV<SUB> s </SUB> stars, and ellipsoidally modulated systems. We determine atmospheric parameters for select systems using follow-up spectroscopy from the 3 m Shane telescope. Finally, we present a Fourier diagnostic plot for classifying binary light curves using the relative amplitudes and phases of their fundamental and harmonic signals in their periodograms. This plot makes it possible to identify certain types of variables efficiently, without directly investigating their light curves, and may assist in the rapid classification of systems observed in large photometric surveys.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...928...20B,[]
Revisiting the Rates and Demographics of Tidal Disruption Events: Effects of the Disk Formation Efficiency,"Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are valuable probes of the demographics of supermassive black holes as well as the dynamics and population of stars in the centers of galaxies. In this Letter, we focus on studying how debris disk formation and circularization processes can impact the possibility of observing prompt flares in TDEs. First, we investigate how the efficiency of disk formation is determined by the key parameters, namely, the black hole mass M <SUB>BH</SUB>, the stellar mass m <SUB>⋆</SUB>, and the orbital penetration parameter β that quantifies how close the disrupted star would orbit around the black hole. Then we calculate the intrinsic differential TDE rate as a function of these three parameters. Combining these two results, we find that the rates of TDEs with prompt disk formation are significantly suppressed around lighter black holes, which provides a plausible explanation for why the observed TDE host black hole mass distribution peaks between 10<SUP>6</SUP> and 10<SUP>7</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Therefore, the consideration of disk formation efficiency is crucial for recovering the intrinsic black hole demographics from TDEs. Furthermore, we find that the efficiency of the disk formation process also impacts the distributions of both stellar orbital penetration parameter and stellar mass observed in TDEs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927L..19W,[]
Revealing the Field Sub-subgiant Population Using a Catalog of Active Giant Stars and Gaia EDR3,"Sub-subgiant stars (SSGs) fall below the subgiant branch and/or red of the giant branch in open and globular clusters, an area of the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) not populated by standard stellar evolution tracks. One hypothesis is that SSGs result from rapid rotation in subgiants or giants due to tidal synchronization in a close binary. The strong magnetic fields generated inhibit convection, which in turn produces large starspots, radius inflation, and lower-than-expected average surface temperatures and luminosities. Here we cross-reference a catalog of active giant binaries (RS CVns) in the field with Gaia EDR3. Using the Gaia photometry and parallaxes, we precisely position the RS CVns in a CMD. We identify stars that fall below a 14 Gyr, metal-rich isochrone as candidate field SSGs. Out of a sample of 1723 RS CVn, we find 448 SSG candidates, a dramatic expansion from the 65 SSGs previously known. Most SSGs have rotation periods of 2-20 days, with the highest SSG fraction found among RS CVn with the shortest periods. The ubiquity of SSGs among this population indicates that SSGs are a normal phase in evolution for RS CVn-type systems, not rare by-products of dynamical encounters found only in dense star clusters as some have suggested. We present our catalog of 1723 active giants, including Gaia photometry and astrometry, and rotation periods from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and International Variable Star Index (VSX). This catalog can serve as an important sample to study the impacts of magnetic fields in evolved stars.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..222L,[]
Identifying Lensed Quasars and Measuring Their Time Delays from Unresolved Light Curves,"Identifying multiply imaged quasars is challenging owing to their low density in the sky and the limited angular resolution of wide-field surveys. We show that multiply imaged quasars can be identified using unresolved light curves, without assuming a light-curve template or any prior information. After describing our method, we show, using simulations, that it can attain high precision and recall when we consider high-quality data with negligible noise well below the variability of the light curves. As the noise level increases to that of the Zwicky Transient Facility telescope, we find that precision can remain close to 100% while recall drops to ~60%. We also consider some examples from Time Delay Challenge 1 and demonstrate that the time delays can be accurately recovered from the joint light-curve data in realistic observational scenarios. We further demonstrate our method by applying it to publicly available COSMOGRAIL data of the observed lensed quasar SDSS J1226-0006. We identify the system as a lensed quasar based on the unresolved light curve and estimate a time delay in good agreement with the one measured by COSMOGRAIL using the individual image light curves. The technique shows great potential to identify lensed quasars in wide-field imaging surveys, especially the soon-to-be-commissioned Vera Rubin Observatory.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..191B,[]
The Type Icn SN 2021csp: Implications for the Origins of the Fastest Supernovae and the Fates of Wolf-Rayet Stars,"We present observations of SN 2021csp, the second example of a newly identified type of supernova (SN) hallmarked by strong, narrow, P Cygni carbon features at early times (Type Icn). The SN appears as a fast and luminous blue transient at early times, reaching a peak absolute magnitude of -20 within 3 days due to strong interaction between fast SN ejecta (v ≈ 30,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) and a massive, dense, fast-moving C/O wind shed by the WC-like progenitor months before explosion. The narrow-line features disappear from the spectrum 10-20 days after explosion and are replaced by a blue continuum dominated by broad Fe features, reminiscent of Type Ibn and IIn supernovae and indicative of weaker interaction with more extended H/He-poor material. The transient then abruptly fades ~60 days post-explosion when interaction ceases. Deep limits at later phases suggest minimal heavy-element nucleosynthesis, a low ejecta mass, or both, and imply an origin distinct from that of classical Type Ic SNe. We place SN 2021csp in context with other fast-evolving interacting transients, and discuss various progenitor scenarios: an ultrastripped progenitor star, a pulsational pair-instability eruption, or a jet-driven fallback SN from a Wolf-Rayet (W-R) star. The fallback scenario would naturally explain the similarity between these events and radio-loud fast transients, and suggests a picture in which most stars massive enough to undergo a W-R phase collapse directly to black holes at the end of their lives.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..180P,[]
Kilonova Detectability with Wide-field Instruments,"Kilonovae are ultraviolet, optical, and infrared transients powered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements following a neutron star merger. Joint observations of kilonovae and gravitational waves can offer key constraints on the source of Galactic r-process enrichment, among other astrophysical topics. However, robust constraints on heavy element production require rapid kilonova detection (within ~1 day of merger) as well as multiwavelength observations across multiple epochs. In this study, we quantify the ability of 13 wide-field-of-view instruments to detect kilonovae, leveraging a large grid of over 900 radiative transfer simulations with 54 viewing angles per simulation. We consider both current and upcoming instruments, collectively spanning the full kilonova spectrum. The Roman Space Telescope has the highest redshift reach of any instrument in the study, observing kilonovae out to z ~ 1 within the first day post-merger. We demonstrate that BlackGEM, DECam, GOTO, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST, ULTRASAT, VISTA, and WINTER can observe some kilonovae out to z ~ 0.1 (~475 Mpc), while DDOTI, MeerLICHT, PRIME, Swift/UVOT, and ZTF are confined to more nearby observations. Furthermore, we provide a framework to infer kilonova ejecta properties following nondetections and explore variation in detectability with these ejecta parameters.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..163C,[]
The Pulsating Helium-atmosphere White Dwarfs. I. New DBVs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,"We present a dedicated search for new pulsating helium-atmosphere (DBV) white dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey using the McDonald 2.1 m Otto Struve Telescope. In total we observed 55 DB and DBA white dwarfs with spectroscopic temperatures between 19,000 and 35,000 K. We find 19 new DBVs and place upper limits on variability for the remaining 36 objects. In combination with previously known DBVs, we use these objects to provide an update to the empirical extent of the DB instability strip. With our sample of new DBVs, the red edge is better constrained, as we nearly double the number of DBVs known between 20,000 and 24,000 K. We do not find any new DBVs hotter than PG 0112+104, the current hottest DBV is at T <SUB>eff</SUB> ≈ 31,000 K, but do find pulsations in four DBVs with temperatures between 27,000 and 30,000 K, improving empirical constraints on the poorly defined blue edge. We investigate the ensemble pulsation properties of all currently known DBVs, finding that the weighted mean period and total pulsation power exhibit trends with effective temperature that are qualitatively similar to the pulsating hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..158V,[]
Microlensing Events in the Galactic Plane Using the Zwicky Transient Facility,"Microlensing is a powerful technique to study the Galactic population of ""dark"" objects such as exoplanets both bound and unbound, brown dwarfs, low-luminosity stars, old white dwarfs, and neutron stars, and it is almost the only way to study isolated stellar-mass black holes. The majority of previous efforts to search for gravitational microlensing events have concentrated toward high-density fields such as the Galactic bulge. Microlensing events in the Galactic plane have the advantage of closer proximity and better constrained relative proper motions, leading to better constrained estimates of lens mass at the expense of a lower optical depth, than events toward the Galactic bulge. We use the Zwicky Transient Facility Data Release 5 compiled from 2018-2021 to survey the Galactic plane in the region of ∣b∣ < 20°. We find a total of 60 candidate microlensing events including three that show a strong microlensing parallax effect. The rate of events traces Galactic structure, decreasing exponentially as a function Galactic longitude with scale length ℓ <SUB>0</SUB> ~ 37°. On average, we find Einstein timescales of our microlensing events to be about three times as long (~60 days) as those toward the Galactic bulge (~20 days). This pilot project demonstrates that microlensing toward the Galactic plane shows strong promise for characterization of dark objects within the Galactic disk.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..150R,[]
A Physical Model of Delayed Rebrightenings in Shock-interacting Supernovae without Narrow-line Emission,"Core-collapse supernovae can display evidence of interaction with preexisting, circumstellar shells of material by rebrightening and forming spectral lines, and can even change types as hydrogen appears in previously hydrogen-poor spectra. However, a recently observed core-collapse supernova-SN 2019tsf-was found to brighten after roughly 100 days after it was first observed, suggesting that the supernova ejecta was interacting with surrounding material, but it lacked any observable emission lines and thereby challenged the standard supernova-interaction picture. We show through linear perturbation theory that delayed rebrightenings without the formation of spectral lines are generated as a consequence of the finite sound-crossing time of the postshock gas left in the wake of a supernova explosion. In particular, we demonstrate that sound waves-generated in the postshock flow as a consequence of the interaction between a shock and a density enhancement-traverse the shocked ejecta and impinge upon the shock from behind in a finite time, generating sudden changes in the shock properties in the absence of ambient density enhancements. We also show that a blast wave dominated by gas pressure and propagating in a wind-fed medium is unstable from the standpoint that small perturbations lead to the formation of reverse shocks within the postshock flow, implying that the gas within the inner regions of these blast waves should be highly turbulent.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..148C,[]
Identification of an X-Ray Pulsar in the BeXRB System IGR J18219-1347,"We report on observations of the candidate Be/X-ray binary (BeXRB) IGR J18219-1347 with the Swift/X-ray Telescope, the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray, and the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer during Type-I outbursts in 2020 March and June. Our timing analysis revealed the spin period of a neutron star with P <SUB>spin</SUB> = 52.46 s. This periodicity, combined with the known orbital period of 72.4 days, indicates that the system is a BeXRB. Furthermore, by comparing the spectral energy distribution of the infrared counterpart to that of known BeXRBs, we confirm this classification and set a distance of approximately 10-15 kpc for the source. The broadband X-ray spectrum (1.5-50 keV) of the source is described by an absorbed power law with a photon index Γ ~ 0.5 and a cutoff energy at ~13 keV.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..139O,[]
Recurrent Strong Outbursts of an EXor-like Young Eruptive Star Gaia20eae,"We present follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations, and subsequent analysis of Gaia20eae. This source triggered photometric alerts during 2020 after showing a ~3 mag increase in its brightness. Its Gaia Alert light curve showed the shape of a typical eruptive young star. We carried out observations to confirm Gaia20eae as an eruptive young star and classify it. Its pre-outburst spectral energy distribution shows that Gaia20eae is a moderately embedded Class II object with L <SUB>bol</SUB> = 7.22 L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The color-color and color-magnitude diagrams indicate that the evolution in the light curve is mostly gray. Multiple epochs of the Hα line profile suggest an evolution of the accretion rate and winds. The near-infrared spectra display several emission lines, a feature typical of EX Lupi-type (EXor) eruptive young stars. We estimated the mass accretion rate during the dimming phase to be $\dot{M}$ = 3-8 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, higher than typical T Tauri stars of similar mass and comparable to other EXors.

"A Carbon/Oxygen-dominated Atmosphere Days after Explosion for the ""Super-Chandrasekhar"" Type Ia SN 2020esm","Seeing pristine material from the donor star in a type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosion can reveal the nature of the binary system. In this paper, we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2020esm, one of the best-studied SNe of the class of ""super-Chandrasekhar"" SNe Ia (SC SNe Ia), with data obtained -12 to +360 days relative to peak brightness, obtained from a variety of ground- and space-based telescopes. Initially misclassified as a type II supernova, SN 2020esm peaked at M <SUB> B </SUB> = -19.9 mag, declined slowly (Δm <SUB>15</SUB>(B) = 0.92 mag), and had particularly blue UV and optical colors at early times. Photometrically and spectroscopically, SN 2020esm evolved similarly to other SC SNe Ia, showing the usual low ejecta velocities, weak intermediate-mass elements, and the enhanced fading at late times, but its early spectra are unique. Our first few spectra (corresponding to a phase of ≳10 days before peak) reveal a nearly pure carbon/oxygen atmosphere during the first days after explosion. This composition can only be produced by pristine material, relatively unaffected by nuclear burning. The lack of H and He may further indicate that SN 2020esm is the outcome of the merger of two carbon/oxygen white dwarfs. Modeling its bolometric light curve, we find an <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass of ${1.23}_{-0.14}^{+0.14}$ M <SUB>⊙</SUB> and an ejecta mass of ${1.75}_{-0.20}^{+0.32}$ M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, in excess of the Chandrasekhar mass.

A Systematic Exploration of Kilonova Candidates from Neutron Star Mergers during the Third Gravitational-wave Observing Run,"We present a comprehensive analysis of 653 optical candidate counterparts reported during the third gravitational-wave (GW) observing run. Our sample concentrates on candidates from the 15 events (published in GWTC-2, GWTC-3, or not retracted on GraceDB) that had a >1% chance of including a neutron star in order to assess their viability as true kilonovae. In particular, we leverage tools available in real time, including pre-merger detections and cross-matching with catalogs (i.e., point-source, variable-star, quasar and host-galaxy redshift data sets), to eliminate 65% of candidates in our sample. We further employ spectroscopic classifications, late-time detections, and light-curve behavior analyses and conclude that 66 candidates remain viable kilonovae. These candidates lack sufficient information to determine their classifications, and the majority would require luminosities greater than that of AT 2017gfo. Pre-merger detections in public photometric survey data and comparison of cataloged host-galaxy redshifts with the GW event distances are critical to incorporate into vetting procedures, as these tools eliminated >20% and >30% of candidates, respectively. We expect that such tools that leverage archival information will significantly reduce the strain on spectroscopic and photometric follow-up resources in future observing runs. Finally, we discuss the critical role prompt updates from GW astronomers to the EM community play in reducing the number of candidates requiring vetting.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927...50R,[]
Gaia GraL: Gaia DR2 Gravitational Lens Systems. VII.

Properties of Type Ibn Supernovae: Implications for the Progenitor Evolution and the Origin of a Population of Rapid Transients,"Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn) show signatures of strong interaction between the SN ejecta and hydrogen-poor circumstellar matter (CSM). Deriving the ejecta and CSM properties of SNe Ibn provides a great opportunity to study the final evolution of massive stars. In the present work, we present a light-curve (LC) model for the ejecta-CSM interaction, taking into account the processes in which the high-energy photons originally created at the forward and reverse shocks are converted to the observed emission in the optical. The model is applied to a sample of SNe Ibn and ""SN Ibn"" rapidly evolving transients. We show that the characteristic post-peak behavior commonly seen in the SN Ibn LCs, where a slow decay is followed by a rapid decay, is naturally explained by the transition of the forward-shock property from cooling to adiabatic regime without introducing a change in the CSM density distribution. The (commonly found) slope in the rapid-decay phase indicates a steep CSM density gradient (ρ <SUB>CSM</SUB> ∝ r <SUP>-3</SUP>), inferring a rapid increase in the mass-loss rate toward the SN as a generic property of the SN Ibn progenitors. From the derived ejecta and CSM properties, we argue that massive Wolf-Rayet stars with an initial mass of ≳18 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> can be a potential class of the progenitors. The present work also indicates the existence of a currently missing population of UV-bright rapid transients for which the final mass-loss rate is lower than the optical SNe Ibn, which can be efficiently probed by future UV missions.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927...25M,[]
Long-term Photometric and Low-resolution Spectroscopic Analysis of Five Contact Binaries,"A photometric and spectroscopic investigation is performed on five W Ursae Majoris eclipsing binaries J015818.6+260247 (hereinafter as J0158b), J073248.4+405538 (hereinafter as J0732), J101330.8+494846 (hereinafter as J1013), J132439.8+130747 (hereinafter as J1324), and J152450.7+245943 (hereinafter as J1524). The photometric data are collected with the help of the 1.3 m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope, the 1.04 m Sampurnanand Telescope, and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite space mission. The low-resolution spectra of the 4 m Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope are used for spectroscopic analysis. The orbital period change of these systems is determined using our photometric data and previously available photometric data from different surveys. The orbital period of J1013 and J1524 is changing at a rate of -2.552 (±0.249) × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> days yr<SUP>-1</SUP> and -6.792( ±0.952) × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> days yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively, while others do not show any orbital period change. The orbital period change of J1013 and J1524 corresponds to a mass transfer rate of 2.199 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> and 6.151 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> from the primary to the secondary component in these systems. It is likely that angular momentum loss via magnetic braking may also be responsible for the observed orbital period change in the case of J1524. All systems have a mass ratio lower than 0.5, except J0158b with a mass ratio of 0.71. All the systems are shallow-type contact binaries. J0158b and J1524 are subtype A while others are subtype W. The H<SUB> α </SUB> emission line region is compared with template spectra prepared using two inactive stars with the help of the STARMOD program. The J0158, J1324, and J1524 systems show excess emission in the residual spectra after subtraction of the template.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927...12P,[]
Less Than 1% of Core-collapse Supernovae in the Local Universe Occur in Elliptical Galaxies,"We present observations of three core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) in elliptical hosts, detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey (BTS). SN 2019ape is a SN Ic that exploded in the main body of a typical elliptical galaxy. Its properties are consistent with an explosion of a regular SN Ic progenitor. A secondary g-band light-curve peak could indicate interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar material (CSM). An Hα-emitting source at the explosion site suggests a residual local star formation origin. SN 2018fsh and SN 2020uik are SNe II which exploded in the outskirts of elliptical galaxies. SN 2020uik shows typical spectra for SNe II, while SN 2018fsh shows a boxy nebular Hα profile, a signature of CSM interaction. We combine these 3 SNe with 7 events from the literature and analyze their hosts as a sample. We present multi-wavelength photometry of the hosts, and compare this to archival photometry of all BTS hosts. Using the spectroscopically complete BTS, we conclude that $0.3{ \% }_{-0.1}^{+0.3}$ of all CCSNe occur in elliptical galaxies. We derive star formation rates and stellar masses for the host galaxies and compare them to the properties of other SN hosts. We show that CCSNe in ellipticals have larger physical separations from their hosts compared to SNe Ia in elliptical galaxies, and discuss implications for star-forming activity in elliptical galaxies.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927...10I,[]
LkHα 225 (V1318 Cyg) South in Outburst,"Magakian et al. called attention to the current bright state of LkHα 225 South, a well-known highly embedded, intermediate-mass young stellar object that over the past two decades has brightened visually from >20<SUP> m </SUP> to <13<SUP> m </SUP>. We present recent optical photometric monitoring showing colorless, nonsinusoidal, periodic brightness oscillations occurring every 43 days with amplitude ~0.7 mag. We also present new flux-calibrated optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, which we model in terms of a Keplerian accretion disk, and high-dispersion spectra that demonstrate similarity to some categories of ""mixed-temperature"" accretion-outburst objects. At blue wavelengths, LkHα 225 South has a pure absorption spectrum and is a good spectral match to the FU Ori stars V1515 Cyg and V1057 Cyg. At red optical and infrared wavelengths, however, the spectrum is more similar to Gaia 19ajj, showing emission in TiO, CO, and metals. Sr II absorption indicates a low-surface-gravity atmosphere. There are also signatures of a strong wind/outflow. LkHα 225 South was moderately bright in the early 1950s as well as in the late 1980s, with evidence for deep fades during intervening epochs. The body of evidence suggests that LkHα 225 South is another case of a source with episodically enhanced accretion that causes brightening by orders of magnitude, and development of a hot absorption spectrum and warm wind. It is similar to Gaia 19ajj, but also reminiscent in its long brightening time and brightness oscillation near peak to the embedded sources L1634 IRS7 and ESO Ha 99.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..115H,[]
SUPPNet: Neural network for stellar spectrum normalisation,Context. Precise continuum normalisation of merged échelle spectra is a demanding task that is necessary for various detailed spectroscopic analyses. Automatic methods have limited effectiveness due to the variety of features present in the spectra of stars. This complexity often leads to the necessity for manual normalisation which is highly time-consuming.,,[]
"Aims: The aim of this work is to develop a fully automated normalisation tool that works with order-merged spectra and offers flexible manual fine-tuning, if necessary.",,,[]
"Methods: The core of the proposed method uses the novel, fully convolutional deep neural network (SUPP Network) that was trained to predict a pseudo-continuum. The post-processing step uses smoothing splines that give access to regressed knots, which are useful for optional manual corrections. The active learning technique was applied to deal with possible biases that may arise from training with synthetic spectra and to extend the applicability of the proposed method to features absent in this kind of spectra.",,,[]
"Results: The developed normalisation method was tested with high-resolution spectra of stars with spectral types from O to G, and gives a root mean squared (RMS) error over the set of test stars equal to 0.0128 in the spectral range from 3900 Å to 7000 Å and 0.0081 in the range from 4200 Å to 7000 Å. Experiments with synthetic spectra give a RMS of the order of 0.0050.",,,[]
"Conclusions: The proposed method leads to results that are comparable to careful manual normalisation. Additionally, this approach is general and can be used in other fields of astronomy where background modelling or trend removal is a part of data processing.",,,[]

On the trail of a comet's tail: A particle tracking algorithm for comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko,"Context. During the post-perihelion phase of the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission to comet <ASTROBJ>67P</ASTROBJ>, the Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System on board the spacecraft took numerous image sequences of the near-nucleus coma, with many showing the motion of individual pieces of debris ejected from active surface areas into space.",,[]
"Aims: We aim to track the motion of individual particles in these image sequences and derive their projected velocities and accelerations. This should help us to constrain their point of origin on the surface, understand the forces that influence their dynamics in the inner coma, and predict whether they will fall back to the surface or escape to interplanetary space.",,,[]
Methods: We have developed an algorithm that tracks the motion of particles appearing as point sources in image sequences. Our algorithm employs a point source detection software to locate the particles and then exploits the image sequences' pair-nature to reconstruct the particle tracks and derive the projected velocities and accelerations. We also constrained the particle size from their brightness.,,,[]
"Results: Our algorithm identified 2268 tracks in a sample image sequence. Manual inspection not only found that 1187 (∼52%) of them are likely genuine, but in combination with runs on simulated data it also revealed a simple criterion related to the completeness of a track to single out a large subset of the genuine tracks without the need for manual intervention. A tentative analysis of a small (n = 89) group of particles exemplifies how our data can be used, and provides first results on the particles' velocity, acceleration, and radius distributions, which agree with previous work.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...659A.171P,,[]
A WISE view on extreme AGB stars,"Context. Variability is a key property of stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). Their pulsation period is related to the luminosity and mass-loss rate (MLR) of the star. Long-period variables (LPVs) and Mira variables are the most prominent of all types of variability of evolved stars. However, the reddest, most obscured AGB stars are too faint in the optical and have eluded large variability surveys.",,[]
"Aims: Our goal is to obtain a sample of LPVs with large MLRs by analysing WISE W1 and W2 light curves (LCs) for about 2000 sources, photometrically selected to include known C-stars with the 11.3 μm silicon carbide dust feature in absorption, and Galactic O-stars with periods longer than 1000 days.",,,[]
"Methods: Epoch photometry was retrieved from the AllWISE and NEOWISE database and fitted with a sinus curve. Photometry from other variability surveys was also downloaded and fitted. For a subset of 316 of the reddest stars, spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were constructed, and, together with mid-infrared (MIR) spectra when available, fitted with a dust radiative transfer programme in order to derive MLRs.",,,[]
"Results: WISE based LCs and fits to the data are presented for all stars. Periods from the literature and periods from refitting other literature data are presented. The results of the spatial correlation with several (IR) databases is presented. About one-third of the sources are found to be not real, but it appears that these cannot be easily filtered out by using WISE flags. Some are clones of extremely bright sources, and in some cases the LCs show the known pulsation period. Inspired by a recent paper, a number of non-variable OH/IRs are identified. Based on a selection on amplitude, a sample of about 750 (candidate) LPVs is selected of which 145 have periods > 1000 days, many of them being new. For the subset of the stars with the colours of C-rich extremely red objects (EROs) the fitting of the SEDs (and available MIR spectra) separates them into C- and O-rich objects. Interestingly, the fitting of MIR spectra of mass-losing C-stars is shown to be a powerful tracer of interstellar reddening when A<SUB>V</SUB> ≳ 2 mag. The number of Galactic EROs appears to be complete up to about 5 kpc and a total dust return rate in the solar neighbourhood for this class is determined. In the LMC 12 additional EROs are identified. Although this represents only about 0.15% of the total known LMC C-star population adding their MLRs increases the previously estimated dust return by 8%. Based on the EROs in the Magellanic Clouds, a bolometric period luminosity is derived. It is pointed out that due to their faintness, EROs and similar O-rich objects are ideal targets for a NIR version of Gaia to obtain distances, observing in the K-band or, even more efficiently, in the L-band.",,,[]

The first study of four doubly eclipsing systems,"We present the discovery and the very first analysis of four stellar systems showing two periods of eclipses, that are the objects classified as doubly eclipsing systems. Some of them were proved to orbit each other thanks to their eclipse-timing-variations (ETVs) of both pairs, hence they really constitute rare quadruples with two eclipsing pairs. Some of them do not, as we are still waiting for more data to detect their mutual movement. Their light curves and period changes were analysed. All of them are detached and near-contact, but none of them contact; moreover, to our knowledge none of these stars can be considered as blend of two spatially unresolved close components on the sky. These systems are CzeV2647 (0.5723296 + 0.9637074 days), proved to orbit with 4.5-year periodicity; CzeV1645 (1.0944877 + 1.6594641 days), with a rather questionable detection of ETV; CzeV3436 (0.6836870 + 0.3833930 days); and, finally, OGLE SMC-ECL-1758 (0.9291925 + 3.7350826 days), proved to move on its 30-year orbit. Even more surprising is the fact that most of these systems show the ratio of their two orbital periods close to coupling near some resonant values of small integers, namely CzeV2647, with only 1% from 3:5 resonance, CzeV1645 1% from 2:3 resonance, and OGLE SMC-ECL-1758 with only 0.49% from 1:4 resonance. The nature of these near-resonant states still remains a mystery.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...659A...8Z,[]
Identifications of RR Lyrae Stars and Quasars from the Simulated Data of Mephisto-W Survey,"We have investigated the feasibilities and accuracies of the identifications of RR Lyrae stars and quasars from the simulated data of the Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) W Survey. Based on the variable sources light curve libraries from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 data and the observation history simulation from the Mephisto-W Survey Scheduler, we have simulated the uvgriz multi-band light curves of RR Lyrae stars, quasars and other variable sources for the first year observation of Mephisto W Survey. We have applied the ensemble machine learning algorithm Random Forest Classifier (RFC) to identify RR Lyrae stars and quasars, respectively. We build training and test samples and extract ~150 features from the simulated light curves and train two RFCs respectively for the RR Lyrae star and quasar classification. We find that, our RFCs are able to select the RR Lyrae stars and quasars with remarkably high precision and completeness, with purity = 95.4% and completeness = 96.9% for the RR Lyrae RFC and purity = 91.4% and completeness = 90.2% for the quasar RFC. We have also derived relative importances of the extracted features utilized to classify RR Lyrae stars and quasars.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022RAA....22b5004L,[]
New Modules for the SEDMachine to Remove Contaminations from Cosmic Rays and Non-target Light: BYECR and CONTSEP,"Currently time-domain astronomy can scan the entire sky on a daily basis, discovering thousands of interesting transients every night. Classifying the ever-increasing number of new transients is one of the main challenges for the astronomical community. One solution that addresses this issue is the robotically controlled Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM) which supports the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). SEDM with its pipeline PYSEDM demonstrates that real-time robotic spectroscopic classification is feasible. In an effort to improve the quality of the current SEDM data, we present here two new modules, BYECR and CONTSEP. The first removes contamination from cosmic rays, and the second removes contamination from non-target light. These new modules are part of the automated PYSEDM pipeline and fully integrated with the whole process. Employing BYECR and CONTSEP modules together automatically extracts more spectra than the current PYSEDM pipeline. Using SNID classification results, the new modules show an improvement in the classification rate and accuracy of 2.8% and 1.7%, respectively, while the strength of the cross-correlation remains the same. Improvements to the SEDM astrometry would further boost the improvement of the CONTSEP module. This kind of robotic follow-up with a fully automated pipeline has the potential to provide the spectroscopic classifications for the transients discovered by ZTF and also by the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134b4505K,[]
Citizen ASAS-SN Data Release. I. Variable Star Classification Using Citizen Science,"We present the first results from Citizen ASAS-SN, a citizen science project for the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) hosted on the Zooniverse platform. Citizen ASAS-SN utilizes the newer, deeper, higher cadence ASAS-SN g-band data and tasks volunteers to classify periodic variable star candidates based on their phased light curves. We started from 40,640 new variable candidates from an input list of ~7.4 million stars with δ < -60° and the volunteers identified 10,420 new discoveries which they classified as 4234 pulsating variables, 3132 rotational variables, 2923 eclipsing binaries, and 131 variables flagged as Unknown. They classified known variable stars with an accuracy of 89% for pulsating variables, 81% for eclipsing binaries, and 49% for rotational variables. We examine user performance, agreement between users, and compare the citizen science classifications with our machine learning classifier updated for the g-band light curves. In general, user activity correlates with higher classification accuracy and higher user agreement. We used the user's ""Junk"" classifications to develop an effective machine learning classifier to separate real from false variables, and there is a clear path for using this ""Junk"" training set to significantly improve our primary machine learning classifier. We also illustrate the value of Citizen ASAS-SN for identifying unusual variables with several examples.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134b4201C,[]
TOI-2285b: A 1.7 Earth-radius planet near the habitable zone around a nearby M dwarf,"We report the discovery of TOI-2285b, a sub-Neptune-sized planet transiting a nearby (42 pc) M dwarf with a period of 27.3 d. We identified the transit signal from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite photometric data, which we confirmed with ground-based photometric observations using the multiband imagers MuSCAT2 and MuSCAT3. Combining these data with other follow-up observations including high-resolution spectroscopy with the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph, high-resolution imaging with the SPeckle Polarimeter, and radial velocity (RV) measurements with the InfraRed Doppler instrument, we find that the planet has a radius of $1.74 \pm 0.08\, R_\oplus$, a mass of $ \!\!19.5\,M_\oplus$ ($95\%$ c.l.), and an insolation flux of 1.54 ± 0.14 times that of the Earth. Although the planet resides just outside the habitable zone for a rocky planet, if the planet harbors an H<SUB>2</SUB>O layer under a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, then liquid water could exist on the surface of the H<SUB>2</SUB>O layer depending on the planetary mass and water mass fraction. The bright host star in the near-infrared (K<SUB>s</SUB> = 9.0) makes this planet an excellent target for further RV and atmospheric observations to improve our understanding of the composition, formation, and habitability of sub-Neptune-sized planets.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASJ...74L...1F,[]
Multimessenger astronomy with a kHz-band gravitational-wave observatory,"Proposed next-generation networks of gravitational-wave observatories include dedicated kilohertz instruments that target neutron star science, such as the proposed Neutron Star Extreme Matter Observatory, NEMO. The original proposal for NEMO highlighted the need for it to exist in a network of gravitational-wave observatories to ensure detection confidence and sky localisation of sources. We show that NEMO-like observatories have significant utility on their own as coincident electromagnetic observations can provide the detection significance and sky localisation. We show that, with a single NEMO-like detector and expected electromagnetic observatories in the late 2020 s and early 2030 s such as the Vera C. Rubin observatory and SVOM, approximately 40% of all binary neutron star mergers detected with gravitational waves could be confidently identified as coincident multimessenger detections. We show that we expect $2^{+10}_{-1}{yr^{-1}}{}$ coincident observations of gravitational-wave mergers with gamma-ray burst prompt emission, $13^{+23}_{-10}{yr^{-1}}{}$ detections with kilonova observations, and $4^{+18}_{-3}{yr^{-1}}{}$ with broadband afterglows and kilonovae, where the uncertainties are 90% confidence intervals arising from uncertainty in current merger-rate estimates. Combined, this implies a coincident detection rate of $14^{+25}_{-11}{yr^{-1}}{}$ out to $300 Mpc$ . These numbers indicate significant science potential for a single kilohertz gravitational-wave detector operating without a global network of other gravitational-wave observatories.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASA...39....7S,[]
Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey: Data Release 1 blended spectra search for candidate strong gravitational lenses,"Here, we present a catalogue of blended spectra in Data Release 1 of the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. Of the 23 197 spectra, 181 showed signs of a blend of redshifts and spectral templates. We examine these blends in detail for signs of either a candidate strong lensing galaxy or a useful overlapping galaxy pair. One of the three DEVILS target fields, COSMOS (D10), is close to complete and it is fully imaged with Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys, and we visually examine the 57 blended spectra in this field in the F814W postage stamps. Nine are classical strong lensing candidates with an elliptical as the lens, out to higher redshifts than any previous search with spectroscopic surveys such as Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) or Galaxy And Mass Assembly. The gravitational lens candidate success rate is similar to earlier such searches (0.1 per cent). Strong gravitational lenses identified with blended spectroscopy have typically shown a high success rate (>70 per cent), which make these interesting targets for future higher resolution lensing studies, monitoring for supernova cosmography, or searches for magnified atomic hydrogen signal.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.2305H,[]
The Zwicky Transient Facility Type Ia supernova survey: first data release and results,"Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the nearby Hubble flow are excellent distance indicators in cosmology. The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) has observed a large sample of SNe from an untargeted, rolling survey, reaching 20.8, 20.6, and 20.3 mag in g r, and i band, respectively. With an FoV of 47 deg<SUP>2</SUP>, ZTF discovered > 3000 SNe Ia in a little over 2.5 yr. Here, we report on the sample of 761 spectroscopically classified SNe Ia from the first year of operations (DR1). The sample has a median redshift $\bar{z} =$ 0.057, nearly a factor of 2 higher than the current low-z sample. Our sample has a total of 934 spectra, of which 632 were obtained with the robotic SEDm on Palomar P60. We assess the potential for precision cosmology for a total of 305 SNe with redshifts from host galaxy spectra. The sample is already comparable in size to the entire combined literature low-z anchor sample. The median first detection is 13.5 d before maximum light, about 10 d earlier than the median in the literature. Furthermore, six SNe from our sample are at D<SUB>L</SUB> < 80 Mpc, for which host galaxy distances can be obtained in the JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE era, such that we have calibrator and Hubble flow SNe observed with the same instrument. In the entire duration of ZTF-I, we have observed nearly 50 SNe for which we can obtain calibrator distances, key for per cent level distance scale measurements.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.2228D,[]
Observable gravitational waves from tidal disruption events and their electromagnetic counterpart,"We estimate the rate of tidal disruption events (TDEs) that will be detectable with future gravitational wave detectors as well as the most probable properties of these events and their possible electromagnetic counterpart. To this purpose, we combine standard gravitational waves and electromagnetic results with detailed rates estimates. We find that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should not detect any TDEs, unless black holes (BHs) are typically embedded by a young stellar population, which, in this situation, could lead up to few 10 events during the duration of the mission. If there are gravitational wave observations, these events should also be observable in the X-ray or the optical/UV part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which may open up the multimessenger era for TDEs. The generation of detectors following LISA will at least yearly observe 10<SUP>4</SUP> TDEs at cosmological distances, allowing to do population studies and constrain the black hole mass function. In all cases, most probable events should be around black holes with a mass such that the Keplerian frequency at the Schwarzschild radius is similar to the optimal frequency of the detector and with a large penetration factor.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.2025P,[]
Optical flux and colour variability of blazars in the ZTF survey,"We investigate the temporal and colour variability of 897 blazars, comprising 455 BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) and 442 Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), selected from the Roma-BZCAT catalogue, using the multiband light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF DR6) survey. Assessing the colour variability characteristics over ~2 yr time-scales, we found that 18.5 per cent (84 out of 455) BL Lacs showed a stronger bluer-when-brighter (BWB) trend, whereas 9.0 per cent (41 out of 455) showed a redder-when-brighter (RWB) trend. The majority (70 per cent) of the BL Lacs showing RWB are host galaxy dominated. For the FSRQ subclass, 10.2 per cent (45 out of 442) objects showed a strong BWB trend and 17.6 per cent (78 out of 442) showed a strong RWB trend. Hence, we find that BL Lacs more commonly follow a BWB trend than do FSRQs. This can be attributed to the more dominant jet emission in the case of BL Lacs and the contribution of thermal emission from the accretion disc for FSRQs. In analysing the colour behaviour on shorter time windows, we find many blazars evince shorter partial trends of BWB or RWB nature (or occasionally both). Some of such complex colour behaviours observed in the colour-magnitude diagrams of the blazars may result from transitions between the jet-dominated state and the disc-dominated state and vice versa.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.1791N,[]
The return of the spin period in DW Cnc and evidence of new high state outbursts,"DW Cnc is an intermediate polar which has previously been observed in both high and low states. Observations of the high state of DW Cnc have previously revealed a spin period at ~38.6 min, however, observations from the 2018 to 2019 low state showed no evidence of the spin period. We present results from our analysis of 12 s cadence photometric data collected by Next Generation Transit Survey of DW Cnc during the high state which began in 2019. Following the previously reported suppression of the spin period signal, we identify the return of this signal during the high state, consistent with previous observations of it. We identify this as the restarting of accretion during the high state. We further identified three short outbursts lasting ~1 d in DW Cnc with a mean recurrence time of ~60 d and an amplitude of ~1 mag. These are the first outbursts identified in DW Cnc since 2008. Due to the short nature of these events, we identify them not as a result of accretion instabilities but instead either from instabilities originating from the interaction of the magnetorotational instability in the accretion disc and the magnetic field generated by the white dwarf or the result of magnetic gating.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.1002D,[]
The large-scale environment of thermonuclear and core-collapse supernovae,"The new generation of wide-field time-domain surveys has made it feasible to study the clustering of supernova (SN) host galaxies in the large-scale structure (LSS) for the first time. We investigate the LSS environment of SN populations, using 106 dark matter density realisations with a resolution of ~3.8 Mpc, constrained by the 2M+ + galaxy survey. We limit our analysis to redshift z < 0.036, using samples of 498 thermonuclear and 782 core-collapse SNe from the Zwicky Transient Facility's Bright Transient Survey and Census of the Local Universe catalogues. We detect clustering of SNe with high significance; the observed clustering of the two SNe populations is consistent with each other. Further, the clustering of SN hosts is consistent with that of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey DR12 spectroscopic galaxy sample in the same redshift range. Using a tidal shear classifier, we classify the LSS into voids, sheets, filaments, and knots. We find that both SNe and SDSS galaxies are predominantly found in sheets and filaments. SNe are significantly under-represented in voids and over-represented in knots compared to the volume fraction in these structures. This work opens the potential for using forthcoming wide-field deep SN surveys as a complementary LSS probe.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510..366T,[]
An imaging polarimetry survey of Type Ia supernovae: are peculiar extinction and polarization properties produced by circumstellar or interstellar matter?,"Some highly reddened Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) display low total-to-selective extinction ratios (R<SUB>V</SUB> ≲ 2) in comparison to that of typical Milky Way dust (R<SUB>V</SUB> ≈ 3.3), and polarization curves that rise steeply to blue wavelengths, with peak polarization values at short wavelengths ($\lambda _{\rm max}  0.4\, \mu$m) in comparison to the typical Galactic values ($\lambda _{\rm max} \approx 0.55\, \mu$ m). Understanding the source of these properties could provide insight into the progenitor systems of SNe Ia. We aim to determine whether they are the result of the host galaxy's interstellar dust or circumstellar dust. This is accomplished by analysing the continuum polarization of 66 SNe Ia in dust-rich spiral galaxies and 13 SNe Ia in dust-poor elliptical galaxies as a function of normalized galactocentric distance. We find that there is a general trend of SNe Ia in spiral galaxies displaying increased polarization values when located closer to the host galaxies' centre, while SNe Ia in elliptical host galaxies display low polarization. Furthermore, all highly polarized SNe Ia in spiral host galaxies display polarization curves rising toward blue wavelengths, while no evidence of such polarization properties is shown in elliptical host galaxies. This indicates that the source of the peculiar polarization curves is likely the result of interstellar material as opposed to circumstellar material. The peculiar polarization and extinction properties observed toward some SNe Ia may be explained by the radiative torque disruption mechanism induced by the SN or the interstellar radiation field.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.6028C,[]
Two c's in a pod: cosmology-independent measurement of the Type Ia supernova colour-luminosity relation with a sibling pair,"Using Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations, we identify a pair of 'sibling' Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), i.e. hosted by the same galaxy at z = 0.0541. They exploded within 200 d from each other at a separation of $0.6\,\mathrm{ arcsec}$ corresponding to a projected distance of only 0.6 kpc. Performing SALT2 light-curve fits to the gri ZTF photometry, we show that for these equally distant 'standardizable candles', there is a difference of 2 mag in their rest-frame B-band peaks, and the fainter supernova (SN) has a significantly red SALT2 colour c = 0.57 ± 0.04, while the stretch values x<SUB>1</SUB> of the two SNe are similar, suggesting that the fainter SN is attenuated by dust in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy. We use these measurements to infer the SALT2 colour standardization parameter, β = 3.5 ± 0.3, independent of the underlying cosmology and Malmquist bias. Assuming the colour excess is entirely due to dust, the result differs by 2σ from the average Milky Way total-to-selective extinction ratio, but is in good agreement with the colour-brightness corrections empirically derived from the most recent SN Ia Hubble-Lemaitre diagram fits. Thus we suggest that SN 'siblings', which will increasingly be discovered in the coming years, can be used to probe the validity of the colour and light-curve shape corrections using in SN Ia cosmology while avoiding important systematic effects in their inference from global multiparameter fits to inhomogeneous data sets, and also help constrain the role of interstellar dust in SN Ia cosmology.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.5340B,[]
The ZTF-BTS Type Ia supernovae luminosity function is consistent with a single progenitor channel for the explosions,"We construct the Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) luminosity function (LF) using the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey (BTS) catalogue. While this magnitude-limited survey has an unprecedented number of objects, it suffers from large distance uncertainties and lacks an estimation of host extinction. We bypass these issues by calculating the intrinsic luminosities from the shape parameters of the light curve's g and r bands, with the luminosities calibrated from the well observed SNe Ia sample of the Carnegie Supernova Project, allowing us to construct, for the first time, the intrinsic LF of SNe Ia. We then use a novel tight relation between the colour stretch and the synthesized <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass, M<SUB>Ni56</SUB>, to determine the M<SUB>Ni56</SUB> distribution of SNe Ia. We find that the LFs are unimodal, with their peaks in line with previous results, but have a much lower rate of dim events and luminous events. We show that the features on top of the unimodal LF-derived distributions are all compatible with statistical noise, consistent with a single progenitor channel for the explosions. We further derive, for the first time, the SNe Ia distribution of host galaxy extinction, and find a mean selective extinction of E(B - V) ≈ 0.1 and a non-negligible fraction with large, $ 1\, \text{mag}$, extinction in the optical bands. The high extinction is typical for luminous SNe, supporting their young population origin.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.5275S,[]
DBSP_DRP: A Python package for automated spectroscopic data reduction of DBSP data,"DBSP_DRP is a python package that provides fully automated data reduction of data taken by the Double Spectrograph (DBSP) at the 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory (Oke & Gunn, 1982). The underlying data reduction functionality to extract 1D spectra, perform flux calibration and correction for atmospheric absorption, and coadd spectra together is provided by PypeIt (Prochaska et al., 2020). The new functionality that DBSP_DRP brings is in orchestrating the complex data reduction process by making smart decisions so that no user input is required after verifying the correctness of the metadata in the raw FITS files in a table-like GUI. Though the primary function of DBSP_DRP is to automatically reduce an entire night of data without user input, it has the flexibility for astronomers to fine-tune the data reduction with GUIs for manually identifying the faintest objects, as well as exposing the full set of PypeIt parameters to be tweaked for users with particular science needs. DBSP_DRP also handles some of the occasional quirks specific to DBSP, such as swapping FITS header cards, adding (an) extra null byte/s to FITS files making them not conform to the FITS specification, and not writing the coordinates of the observation to file. Additionally, DBSP_DRP contains a quicklook script for making real-time decisions during an observing run, and can open a GUI displaying a minimally reduced exposure in under 15 seconds. Docker containers are available for ease of deploying DBSP_DRP in its quicklook configuration (without some large atmospheric model files) or in its full configuration.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JOSS....7.3612M,[]
Astronomical big data processing using machine learning: A comprehensive review,"Astronomy, being one of the oldest observational sciences, has collected a lot of data over the ages. In recent times, it is experiencing a huge data surge due to advancements in telescopic technologies with automated digital outputs. The main driver behind this article is to present various relevant Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and big data frameworks or tools being applied and can be employed in large astronomical data-set analysis to assist astronomers in solving multiple vital intriguing problems. Throughout this survey, we attempt to review, evaluate and summarize diverse astronomical data sources, gain knowledge of structure, the complexity of the data, and challenges in the data processing. Additionally, we discuss ample technologies being developed to handle and process this voluminous data. We also look at numerous activities being carried out all over the world enriching this domain. While going through existing literature, we perceived a limited number of comprehensive studies reported so far analyzing astronomy data-sets from the viewpoint of parallel processing and machine learning collectively. This motivated us to pursue this extensive literature review task by outlining up-to-date contributions and opportunities available in this area. Besides, this article also discusses briefly a cloud-based machine learning approach to estimate the extra-galactic object redshifts considering photometric data as input features. As the intersection of big data, machine learning and astronomy is a quite new paradigm, this article will create a strong awareness among interested young scientists for future research and provide an appropriate insight on how these algorithms and tools are becoming inevitable to the astronomy community day by day.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ExA....53....1S,[]
A Fresh Look at AGB Stars in Galactic Open Clusters with Gaia: Impact on Stellar Models and the Initial-Final Mass Relation,"Benefiting from the Gaia second and early third releases of photometric and astrometric data, we examine the population of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that appear in the fields of intermediate-age and young open star clusters. We identify 49 AGB star candidates, brighter than the tip of the red giant branch, with a good to high cluster membership probability. Among them, we find 19 TP-AGB stars with known spectral type: 4 M stars, 3 MS/S stars, and 12 C stars. By combining observations, stellar models, and radiative transfer calculations that include the effect of circumstellar dust, we characterize each star in terms of initial mass, luminosity, mass-loss rate, core mass, period, and mode of pulsation. The information collected helps us shed light on the TP-AGB evolution at solar-like metallicity, placing constraints on the third dredge-up process, the initial masses of carbon stars, stellar winds, and the initial-final mass relation (IFMR). In particular, we find that two bright carbon stars, MSB 75 and BM IV 90, members of the clusters NGC 7789 and NGC 2660 (with similar ages of ≃ 1.2-1.6 Gyr and initial masses 2.1 ≳ M <SUB>i</SUB> /M <SUB>⊙</SUB> ≳ 1.9), have unusually high core masses, M <SUB>c</SUB> ≈ 0.67-0.7 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. These results support the findings of a recent work (Marigo et al. 2020) that identified a kink in the IFMR, which interrupts its monotonic trend just at the same initial masses. Finally, we investigate two competing scenarios to explain the M <SUB>c</SUB> data: the role of stellar winds in single-star evolution, and binary interactions through the blue straggler channel.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..258...43M,[]
The Unanticipated Phenomenology of the Blazar PKS 2131-021: A Unique Supermassive Black Hole Binary Candidate,"Most large galaxies host supermassive black holes in their nuclei and are subject to mergers, which can produce a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB), and hence periodic signatures due to orbital motion. We report unique periodic radio flux density variations in the blazar PKS 2131-021, which strongly suggest an SMBHB with an orbital separation of ~0.001-0.01 pc. Our 45.1 yr radio light curve shows two epochs of strong sinusoidal variation with the same period and phase to within ≲2% and ~10%, respectively, straddling a 20 yr period when this variation was absent. Our simulated light curves accurately reproduce the ""red noise"" of this object, and Lomb-Scargle, weighted wavelet Z-transform and least-squares sine-wave analyses demonstrate conclusively, at the 4.6σ significance level, that the periodicity in this object is not due to random fluctuations in flux density. The observed period translates to 2.082 ± 0.003 yr in the rest frame at the z = 1.285 redshift of PKS 2131-021. The periodic variation in PKS 2131-021 is remarkably sinusoidal. We present a model in which orbital motion, combined with the strong Doppler boosting of the approaching relativistic jet, produces a sine-wave modulation in the flux density that easily fits the observations. Given the rapidly developing field of gravitational-wave experiments with pulsar timing arrays, closer counterparts to PKS 2131-021 and searches using the techniques we have developed are strongly motivated. These results constitute a compelling demonstration that the phenomenology, not the theory, must provide the lead in this field.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926L..35O,[]
Optical Rebrightening of Extragalactic Transients from the Zwicky Transient Facility,"Ongoing large-scale optical time-domain surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), are producing alerts at unprecedented rates. Analysis of transient sources has so far followed two distinct paths: archival analysis of data on transient sources at a time when they are no longer observable and real-time analysis at the time when the sources are first detected. The latter is the realm of alert brokers such as the Arizona-NOIRLab Temporal Analysis and Response to Events System (ANTARES). In this paper, we synthesize the two analysis paths and present a first systematic study of archival alert-broker data, focusing on extragalactic transients with multipeaked light curves identified in the ANTARES archive of ZTF alerts. Our analysis yields a sample of 37 such sources, including core-collapse supernovae (with two analogs of iPTF14hls), thermonuclear supernovae interacting with their surrounding circumstellar medium, tidal disruption events, luminous blue variables, and as yet unclassified objects. A large fraction of the identified sources is currently active, warranting allocation of follow-up resources in the immediate future to further constrain their nature and the physical processes at work.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926L..11S,[]
New Clues to the Evolution of Dwarf Carbon Stars From Their Variability and X-Ray Emission,"As main-sequence stars with C > O, dwarf carbon (dC) stars are never born alone but inherit carbon-enriched material from a former asymptotic giant branch (AGB) companion. In contrast to M dwarfs in post-mass-transfer binaries, C<SUB>2</SUB> and/or CN molecular bands allow dCs to be identified with modest-resolution optical spectroscopy, even after the AGB remnant has cooled beyond detectability. Accretion of substantial material from the AGB stars should spin up the dCs, potentially causing a rejuvenation of activity detectable in X-rays. Indeed, a few dozen dCs have recently been found to have photometric variability with periods under a day. However, most of those are likely post-common-envelope binaries, spin-orbit locked by tidal forces, rather than solely spun-up by accretion. Here, we study the X-ray properties of a sample of the five nearest-known dCs with Chandra. Two are detected in X-rays, the only two for which we also detected short-period photometric variability. We suggest that the coronal activity detected so far in dCs is attributable to rapid rotation due to tidal locking in short binary orbits after a common-envelope phase, late in the thermally pulsing (TP) phase of the former C-AGB primary (TP-AGB).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926..210R,[]
A Systematic Analysis of Stellar Populations in the Host Galaxies of Changing-look AGNs,"""Changing-look"" active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs) are a newly discovered class of AGNs that show the appearance (or disappearance) of broad emission lines within short timescales (months to years), and are often associated with dramatic changes in their continuum emissions. They provide us with an unprecedented chance to directly investigate the host galaxy properties with minimal contamination from the luminous central engine during the turn-off state, which is difficult for normal luminous AGNs. In this work, for the first time, we systematically characterize the stellar populations and star formation histories of host galaxies for 26 turn-off CL-AGNs using the stellar population synthesis code STARLIGHT. We find that the stellar populations of CL-AGNs are similar to those of normal AGNs, except that the intermediate stellar populations contribute more fractions. We estimate their stellar velocity dispersions (σ <SUB>⋆</SUB>) and black hole masses (M <SUB>BH,vir</SUB>), and find that CL-AGNs also follow the overall M <SUB>BH</SUB>-σ <SUB>⋆</SUB> relationship. We also confirm the previous claims that CL-AGNs tend to be biased toward lower Eddington ratios, and that their extreme variabilities are more likely due to the intrinsic changes of the accretion rates. In addition, CL-AGNs with recent star formations tend to have higher Eddington ratios. Compared with previous studies, our analysis suggests that there may be a correlation between CL-AGN host galaxy properties and their CL phenomena.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926..184J,[]
An Infrared Search for Kilonovae with the WINTER Telescope. I. Binary Neutron Star Mergers,"The Wide-Field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) is a new 1 deg<SUP>2</SUP> seeing-limited time-domain survey instrument designed for dedicated near-infrared follow-up of kilonovae from binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole mergers. WINTER will observe in the near-infrared Y, J, and short-H bands (0.9-1.7 μm, to J <SUB> AB </SUB> = 21 mag) on a dedicated 1 m telescope at Palomar Observatory. To date, most prompt kilonova follow-up has been in optical wavelengths; however, near-infrared emission fades more slowly and depends less on geometry and viewing angle than optical emission. We present an end-to-end simulation of a follow-up campaign during the fourth observing run (O4) of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA interferometers, including simulating 625 BNS mergers, their detection in gravitational waves, low-latency and full parameter estimation skymaps, and a suite of kilonova lightcurves from two different model grids. We predict up to five new kilonovae independently discovered by WINTER during O4, given a realistic BNS merger rate. Using a larger grid of kilonova parameters, we find that kilonova emission is ≈2 times longer lived and red kilonovae are detected ≈1.5 times further in the infrared than in the optical. For 90% localization areas smaller than 150 (450) deg<SUP>2</SUP>, WINTER will be sensitive to more than 10% of the kilonova model grid out to 350 (200) Mpc. We develop a generalized toolkit to create an optimal BNS follow-up strategy with any electromagnetic telescope and present WINTER's observing strategy with this framework. This toolkit, all simulated gravitational-wave events, and skymaps are made available for use by the community.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926..152F,[]
Circumstellar Interaction Powers the Light Curves of Luminous Rapidly Evolving Optical Transients,"Rapidly evolving transients, or objects that rise and fade in brightness on timescales two to three times shorter than those of typical Type Ia or Type II supernovae (SNe), have uncertain progenitor systems and powering mechanisms. Recent studies have noted similarities between rapidly evolving transients and Type Ibn SNe, which are powered by ejecta interacting with He-rich circumstellar material (CSM). In this work we present multiband photometric and spectroscopic observations from Las Cumbres Observatory and Swift of four fast-evolving Type Ibn SNe. We compare these observations with those of rapidly evolving transients identified in the literature. We discuss several common characteristics between these two samples, including their light curve and color evolution as well as their spectral features. To investigate a common powering mechanism we construct a grid of analytical model light curves with luminosity inputs from CSM interaction as well as <SUP>56</SUP>Ni radioactive decay. We find that models with ejecta masses of ≈1-3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, CSM masses of ≈0.2-1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, and CSM radii of ≈20-65 au can explain the diversity of peak luminosities, rise times, and decline rates observed in Type Ibn SNe and rapidly evolving transients. This suggests that a common progenitor system-the core collapse of a high-mass star within a dense CSM shell-can reproduce the light curves of even the most luminous and fast-evolving objects, such as AT 2018cow. This work is one of the first to reproduce the light curves of both SNe Ibn and other rapidly evolving transients with a single model.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926..125P,[]
Radio and X-Ray Observations of the Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient AT 2020xnd,"We present deep X-ray and radio observations of the fast blue optical transient (FBOT) AT 2020xnd/ZTF 20acigmel at z = 0.2433 from 13 days to 269 days after explosion. AT 2020xnd belongs to the category of optically luminous FBOTs with similarities to the archetypal event AT 2018cow. AT 2020xnd shows luminous radio emission reaching L <SUB> ν </SUB> ≈ 8 × 10<SUP>29</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> Hz<SUP>-1</SUP> at 20 GHz and 75 days post-explosion, accompanied by luminous and rapidly fading soft X-ray emission peaking at L <SUB>X</SUB> ≈ 6 × 10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Interpreting the radio emission in the context of synchrotron radiation from the explosion's shock interaction with the environment, we find that AT 2020xnd launched a high-velocity outflow (v ~ 0.1c-0.2c) propagating into a dense circumstellar medium (effective $\dot{M}\approx {10}^{-3}\,{M}_{\odot }$ yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for an assumed wind velocity of v <SUB>w</SUB> = 1000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). Similar to AT 2018cow, the detected X-ray emission is in excess compared to the extrapolated synchrotron spectrum and constitutes a different emission component, possibly powered by accretion onto a newly formed black hole or neutron star. These properties make AT 2020xnd a high-redshift analog to AT 2018cow, and establish AT 2020xnd as the fourth member of the class of optically luminous FBOTs with luminous multiwavelength counterparts.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926..112B,[]
Late-onset Circumstellar Medium Interactions are Rare: An Unbiased GALEX View of Type Ia Supernovae,"Using ultraviolet (UV) light curves, we constrain the circumstellar environments of 1080 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) within z < 0.5 from archival Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) observations. All SNe Ia are required to have pre- and post-explosion GALEX observations to ensure adequate subtraction of the host-galaxy flux. Using the late-time GALEX observations, we look for the UV excess expected from any interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM). Four SNe Ia are detected near maximum light, and we compare the GALEX photometry to archival data. However, we find that none of our targets show convincing evidence of CSM interaction. A recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) survey estimates that ~6% of SNe Ia may interact with distant CSM, but statistical inferences are complicated by the small sample size and selection effects. By injecting model light curves into our data and then recovering them, we constrain a broad range of CSM interactions based on the CSM interaction start time and the maximum luminosity. Combining our GALEX nondetections with the HST results, we constrain occurrence of late-onset CSM interaction among SNe Ia with moderate CSM interaction, similar to that observed in PTF11kx, to f <SUB>CSM</SUB> ≲ 5.1% between 0 and 500 days after discovery and ≲2.7% between 500 and 1000 days after discovery at 90% confidence. For weaker CSM interactions similar to SN 2015cp, we obtain limits of ≲16% and ≲4.8%, respectively, for the same time ranges.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926...98D,[]
Gaia 20eae: A Newly Discovered Episodically Accreting Young Star,"The Gaia Alert System issued an alert on 2020 August 28, on Gaia 20eae when its light curve showed a ~4.25 magnitude outburst. We present multiwavelength photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations of this source since 2020 August and identify it as the newest member of the FUor/EXor family of sources. We find that the present brightening of Gaia 20eae is not due to the dust-clearing event but due to an intrinsic change in the spectral energy distribution. The light curve of Gaia 20eae shows a transition stage during which most of its brightness (~3.4 mag) has occurred on a short timescale of 34 days with a rise rate of 3 mag/month. Gaia 20eae has now started to decay at a rate of 0.3 mag/month. We have detected a strong P Cygni profile in Hα, which indicates the presence of winds originating from regions close to the accretion. We find signatures of very strong and turbulent outflow and accretion in Gaia 20eae during this outburst phase. We have also detected a redshifted absorption component in all of the Ca II IR triplet lines consistent with a signature of hot infalling gas in the magnetospheric accretion funnel. This enables us to constrain the viewing angle with respect to the accretion funnel. Our investigation of Gaia 20eae points toward magnetospheric accretion being the phenomenon for the current outburst.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926...68G,[]
The Early Phases of Supernova 2020pni: Shock Ionization of the Nitrogen-enriched Circumstellar Material,"We present multiwavelength observations of the Type II SN 2020pni. Classified at ~1.3 days after explosion, the object showed narrow (FWHM intensity <250 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) recombination lines of ionized helium, nitrogen, and carbon, as typically seen in flash-spectroscopy events. Using the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN to model our first high-resolution spectrum, we infer a progenitor mass-loss rate of \dot{M}=(3.5\mbox{--}5.3)\times {10}^{-3}$ M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> (assuming a wind velocity of v <SUB> w </SUB> = 200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), estimated at a radius of R <SUB>in</SUB> = 2.5 × 10<SUP>14</SUP> cm. In addition, we find that the progenitor of SN 2020pni was enriched in helium and nitrogen (relative abundances in mass fractions of 0.30-0.40 and 8.2 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP>, respectively). Radio upper limits are also consistent with dense circumstellar material (CSM) and a mass-loss rate of \dot{M} 5\times {10}^{-4}\,{M}_{\odot }\,{{\rm{yr}}}^{-1}$ . During the initial 4 days after first light, we also observe an increase in velocity of the hydrogen lines (from ~250 to ~1000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), suggesting complex CSM. The presence of dense and confined CSM, as well as its inhomogeneous structure, indicates a phase of enhanced mass loss of the progenitor of SN 2020pni during the last year before explosion. Finally, we compare SN 2020pni to a sample of other shock-photoionization events. We find no evidence of correlations among the physical parameters of the explosions and the characteristics of the CSM surrounding the progenitors of these events. This favors the idea that the mass loss experienced by massive stars during their final years could be governed by stochastic phenomena and that, at the same time, the physical mechanisms responsible for this mass loss must be common to a variety of different progenitors.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926...20T,[]
"The Fast Evolving, Tremendous Blue Superoutburst in ASASSN-21au Reveals a Dichotomy in the Outbursts of Long-period AM CVns","ASASSN-21au is an ultracompact accreting white dwarf binary (AM CVn type) with a period of ~58 minutes. Using multiwavelength observations of the system, we discovered a dichotomy in the behavior of outbursts in AM CVns. The binary showed an initial increase in brightness that lasted for at least 82 days, followed by an additional increase that lasted two weeks. Afterward, ASASSN-21au went into superoutburst with a total duration of 19 days, showing an amplitude with respect to quiescence of ~7.5 mag in g, with a precursor and an echo outburst. A correlation between X-rays, UV, and optical was identified for the first time in an AM CVn during this stage. The color evolution of ASASSN-21au indicates that during the superoutburst the dominant component was the accretion disk. The short duration, large amplitude, and color evolution of the superoutburst agree with expectations from the disk instability model. These characteristics are opposite to those observed in SDSS J080710+485259 and SDSS J113732+405458, which have periods of ~53 minutes and ~60 minutes, respectively. The initially slow increase in brightness in the light curve of ASASSN-21au and the behavior after the superoutburst favor a scenario in which changes in the mass-transfer rate led to disk instabilities, while the outburst mechanism of SDSS J080710+485259 and SDSS J113732+405458 has been attributed to enhanced mass transfer alone. Further observations are needed to understand the origin of this dichotomy.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926...10R,[]
Discovery of a Double-detonation Thermonuclear Supernova Progenitor,"We present the discovery of a new double-detonation progenitor system consisting of a hot subdwarf B (sdB) binary with a white dwarf companion with a P <SUB>orb</SUB> = 76.34179(2) minutes orbital period. Spectroscopic observations are consistent with an sdB star during helium core burning residing on the extreme horizontal branch. Chimera light curves are dominated by ellipsoidal deformation of the sdB star and a weak eclipse of the companion white dwarf. Combining spectroscopic and light curve fits, we find a low-mass sdB star, M <SUB>sdB</SUB> = 0.383 ± 0.028 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> with a massive white dwarf companion, M <SUB>WD</SUB> = 0.725 ± 0.026 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. From the eclipses we find a blackbody temperature for the white dwarf of 26,800 K resulting in a cooling age of ≈25 Myr whereas our MESA model predicts an sdB age of ≈170 Myr. We conclude that the sdB formed first through stable mass transfer followed by a common envelope which led to the formation of the white dwarf companion ≈25 Myr ago. Using the MESA stellar evolutionary code we find that the sdB star will start mass transfer in ≈6 Myr and in ≈60 Myr the white dwarf will reach a total mass of 0.92 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> with a thick helium layer of 0.17 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. This will lead to a detonation that will likely destroy the white dwarf in a peculiar thermonuclear supernova. PTF1 J2238+7430 is only the second confirmed candidate for a double-detonation thermonuclear supernova. Using both systems we estimate that at least ≈1% of white dwarf thermonuclear supernovae originate from sdB+WD binaries with thick helium layers, consistent with the small number of observed peculiar thermonuclear explosions.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925L..12K,[]
SN 2020sck: Deflagration in a Carbon-Oxygen White Dwarf,"We present optical UBVRI photometry and low-to-medium resolution spectroscopic observations of type Iax supernova SN 2020sck spanning -5.5 days to +67 days from maximum light in the B-band. From the photometric analysis we find Δm <SUB> B </SUB>(15) = 2.03 ± 0.05 mag and M <SUB> B </SUB> = -17.81 ± 0.22 mag.

One-dimensional radiative transfer modeling of the spectra with TARDIS shows higher density in the ejecta near the photosphere and a steep decrease in the outer layers with an ejecta composition dominated mostly by C, O, Si, Fe, and Ni. The star-formation rate of the host galaxy computed from the luminosity of the Hα (λ6563) line is 0.09 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, indicating a relatively young stellar environment.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925..217D,[]
A Matched Survey for the Enigmatic Low Radio Frequency Transient ILT J225347+862146,"Discovered in 2011 with LOFAR, the 15 Jy low-frequency radio transient ILT J225347+862146 heralds a potentially prolific population of radio transients at <100 MHz. However, subsequent transient searches in similar parameter space yielded no detections. We test the hypothesis that these surveys at comparable sensitivity have missed the population due to mismatched survey parameters. In particular, the LOFAR survey used only 195 kHz of bandwidth at 60 MHz, while other surveys were at higher frequencies or had wider bandwidth. Using 137 hr of all-sky images from the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array, we conduct a narrowband transient search at ~10 Jy sensitivity with timescales from 10 minutes to 1 day and a bandwidth of 722 kHz at 60 MHz. To model the remaining survey selection effects, we introduce a flexible Bayesian approach for inferring transient rates. We do not detect any transient and find compelling evidence that our nondetection is inconsistent with the detection of ILT J225347+862146. Under the assumption that the transient is astrophysical, we propose two hypotheses that may explain our nondetection. First, the transient population associated with ILT J225347+862146 may have a low all-sky density and display strong temporal clustering. Second, ILT J225347+862146 may be an extreme instance of the fluence distribution, of which we revise the surface density estimate at 15 Jy to 1.1 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> deg<SUP>-2</SUP> with a 95% credible interval of (3.5 × 10<SUP>-12</SUP>, 3.4 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP>) deg<SUP>-2</SUP>. Finally, we find a previously identified object coincident with ILT J225347+862146 to be an M dwarf at 420 pc.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925..171H,[]
A Search for Planet Nine using the Zwicky Transient Facility Public Archive,"Recent estimates of the characteristics of Planet Nine have suggested that it could be closer than originally assumed. Such a Planet Nine would also be brighter than originally assumed, suggesting the possibility that it has already been observed in wide-field moderate-depth surveys. We search for Planet Nine in the Zwicky Transient Facility public archive and find no candidates. Using known asteroids to calculate the magnitude limit of the survey, we find that we should have detected Planet Nine throughout most of the northern portion of its predicted orbit-including within the galactic plane-to a 95% detection efficiency of approximately V = 20.5. To aid in understanding detection limits for this and future analyses, we present a full-sky synthetic Planet Nine population drawn from a statistical sampling of predicted Planet Nine orbits. We use this reference population to estimate that this survey rules out 56% of predicted Planet Nine phase space, and we demonstrate how future analyses can use the same synthetic population to continue to constrain the amount of parameter space effectively searched for Planet Nine.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..102B,[]
Finding Fast Transients in Real Time Using a Novel Light-curve Analysis Algorithm,"The current data acquisition rate of astronomical transient surveys and the promise for significantly higher rates in the next decade necessitate the development of novel approaches to analyze astronomical data sets and promptly detect objects of interest. The Deeper, Wider, Faster (DWF) program is a survey focused on the identification of fast-evolving transients, such as fast radio bursts, gamma-ray bursts, and supernova shock breakouts. It employs multifrequency simultaneous coverage of the same part of the sky over several orders of magnitude. Using the Dark Energy Camera mounted on the 4 m Blanco telescope, DWF captures a 20 s g-band exposure every minute, at a typical seeing of ~1″ and an air mass of ~1.5. These optical data are collected simultaneously with observations conducted over the entire electromagnetic spectrum-from radio to γ-rays-as well as cosmic-ray observations. In this paper, we present a novel real-time light-curve analysis algorithm, designed to detect transients in the DWF optical data; this algorithm functions independently from, or in conjunction with, image subtraction. We present a sample of fast transients detected by our algorithm, as well as a false-positive analysis. Our algorithm is customizable and can be tuned to be sensitive to transients evolving over different timescales and flux ranges.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163...95S,[]
An Eccentric Brown Dwarf Eclipsing an M dwarf,"We report the discovery of an M = 67 ± 2M <SUB>J</SUB> brown dwarf transiting the early M dwarf TOI-2119 on an eccentric orbit (e = 0.3362 ± 0.0005) at an orbital period of 7.200861 ± 0.000005 days. We confirm the brown dwarf nature of the transiting companion using a combination of ground-based and space-based photometry and high-precision velocimetry from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder. Detection of the secondary eclipse with TESS photometry enables a precise determination of the eccentricity and reveals the brown dwarf has a brightness temperature of 2100 ± 80 K, a value which is consistent with an early L dwarf. TOI-2119 is one of the most eccentric known brown dwarfs with P < 10 days, possibly due to the long circularization timescales for an object orbiting an M dwarf. We assess the prospects for determining the obliquity of the host star to probe formation scenarios and the possibility of additional companions in the system using Gaia EDR3 and our radial velocities.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163...89C,[]
Photometric Classification of Early-time Supernova Light Curves with SCONE,"In this work, we present classification results on early supernova light curves from SCONE, a photometric classifier that uses convolutional neural networks to categorize supernovae (SNe) by type using light-curve data. SCONE is able to identify SN types from light curves at any stage, from the night of initial alert to the end of their lifetimes. Simulated LSST SNe light curves were truncated at 0, 5, 15, 25, and 50 days after the trigger date and used to train Gaussian processes in wavelength and time space to produce wavelength-time heatmaps. SCONE uses these heatmaps to perform six-way classification between SN types Ia, II, Ibc, Ia-91bg, Iax, and SLSN-I. SCONE is able to perform classification with or without redshift, but we show that incorporating redshift information improves performance at each epoch. SCONE achieved 75% overall accuracy at the date of trigger (60% without redshift), and 89% accuracy 50 days after trigger (82% without redshift). SCONE was also tested on bright subsets of SNe (r < 20 mag) and produced 91% accuracy at the date of trigger (83% without redshift) and 95% five days after trigger (94.7% without redshift). SCONE is the first application of convolutional neural networks to the early-time photometric transient classification problem.

Forecast for cosmological parameter estimation with gravitational-wave standard sirens from the LISA-Taiji network,"LISA and Taiji are expected to form a space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detection network in the future. In this work, we make a forecast for the cosmological parameter estimation with the standard siren observation from the LISA-Taiji network. We simulate the standard siren data based on a scenario with configuration angle of 40° between LISA and Taiji. Three models for the population of massive black hole binary (MBHB), i.e., pop III, Q3d, and Q3nod, are considered to predict the events of MBHB mergers. We find that, based on the LISA-Taiji network, the number of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts detected is almost doubled compared with the case of single Taiji mission. Therefore, the LISA-Taiji network's standard siren observation could provide much tighter constraints on cosmological parameters. For example, solely using the standard sirens from the LISA-Taiji network, the constraint precision of H<SUB>0</SUB> could reach 1.3%. Moreover, combined with the CMB data, the GW-EM observation based on the LISA-Taiji network could also tightly constrain the equation of state of dark energy, e.g., the constraint precision of w reaches about 4%, which is comparable with the result of CMB+BAO+SN. It is concluded that the GW standard sirens from the LISA-Taiji network will become a useful cosmological probe in understanding the nature of dark energy in the future.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022SCPMA..6510411W,[]
The Variability of the Narrow-line Seyfert 1 Galaxies from the Pan-STARRS's View,"By means of the data sets from the Pan-STARRS1 survey, we have systematically examined the relationship between the variability characteristics and the physical parameters of the largest NLS1 galaxy sample up to now. The results are summarized as follows: (1). We find significant anti-correlations between variability amplitude and absolute magnitude in g, r, i, z and y bands, which are consistent with the results in previous works. (2) The correlations between the variability amplitude in optical band and many physical parameters (e.g., λ L(5100 Å), black hole mass, Eddington ratio, R <SUB>4570</SUB> and R <SUB>5007</SUB>) are investigated. The results show the variability amplitude is significantly anti-correlated with L(5100 Å), M <SUB>BH</SUB>, Eddington ratio and R <SUB>4570</SUB>, but positively correlated with R <SUB>5007</SUB>. The relation could be explained by the simple standard accretion disk model. (3) We further investigate the relationship between optical variability and radio luminosity/radio-loudness. The results present weak positive correlation in g and r bands, but insignificant correlation in i, z and y bands. The large error of the approximate fraction of the host galaxy in i, z and y bands may lead to insignificant correlations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022RAA....22a5014W,[]
Role of Topocentric Parallax in Near-Earth Object Initial Orbit Determination,"Near-Earth Object (NEO) initial orbit determination typically uses astrometric measurements during a close approach over a time window much shorter than the orbital period of the NEO. The initial orbit is only weakly determined with dominant uncertainties in the distance of the NEO from the Earth. Topocentric astrometric measurements allow us to estimate NEO distances using observed nonlinear motions of the NEOs relative to observers, which come from the relative orbital motion of the NEOs to the Earth plus the topocentric parallax (parallax) from the diversity of observatory locations relative to the Earth center. We calculate the ratio of the contributions to the nonlinear motion from the relative orbital motion and the parallax to be approximately (TΔ/(day au))<SUP>2</SUP>, where T is the arc length measured in days and Δ is the distance of close approach. The dominant nonlinear motion for ranging the NEO comes from the relative orbital motion of the NEO to the Earth center, due to mainly the differential solar gravitational acceleration, when TΔ ≳ 1 day au and the parallax when TΔ ≲ 1 day au. This is confirmed by simulation data and supported by observational data of real NEOs. In the regime TΔ ≲ 1 day au, the orbit determination uncertainties are inversely proportional to the amplitude of the parallax. Introducing diversities of hour angles and observatory latitudes (especially alternating between extreme values) into scheduled follow-up observations can improve the parallax amplitude, thus the orbit accuracy. Most of the newly discovered NEOs are in this regime, we recommend optimizing parallax by properly scheduling observations when the NEO is very close to the Earth and using synthetic tracking to improve astrometry accuracy for initial orbit determination.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134a5005Z,[]
A WC/WO star exploding within an expanding carbon-oxygen-neon nebula,"The final fate of massive stars, and the nature of the compact remnants they leave behind (black holes and neutron stars), are open questions in astrophysics. Many massive stars are stripped of their outer hydrogen envelopes as they evolve. Such Wolf-Rayet stars<SUP>1</SUP> emit strong and rapidly expanding winds with speeds greater than 1,000 kilometres per second. A fraction of this population is also helium-depleted, with spectra dominated by highly ionized emission lines of carbon and oxygen (types WC/WO). Evidence indicates that the most commonly observed supernova explosions that lack hydrogen and helium (types Ib/Ic) cannot result from massive WC/WO stars<SUP>2,3</SUP>, leading some to suggest that most such stars collapse directly into black holes without a visible supernova explosion<SUP>4</SUP>. Here we report observations of SN 2019hgp, beginning about a day after the explosion. Its short rise time and rapid decline place it among an emerging population of rapidly evolving transients<SUP>5-8</SUP>. Spectroscopy reveals a rich set of emission lines indicating that the explosion occurred within a nebula composed of carbon, oxygen and neon. Narrow absorption features show that this material is expanding at high velocities (greater than 1,500 kilometres per second), requiring a compact progenitor. Our observations are consistent with an explosion of a massive WC/WO star, and suggest that massive Wolf-Rayet stars may be the progenitors of some rapidly evolving transients.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Natur.601..201G,[]
Eclipsing white dwarf binaries in Gaia and the Zwicky Transient Faaccility,"Gaia provided the largest ever catalogue of white dwarf stars. We use this catalogue, along with the third public data release of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), to identify new eclipsing white dwarf binaries. Our method exploits light-curve statistics and the box least-squares algorithm to detect periodic light-curve variability. The search revealed 18 new binaries, of which 17 are eclipsing. We use the position in the Gaia H-R diagram to classify these binaries and find that the majority of these white dwarfs have MS companions. We identify one system as a candidate eclipsing white dwarf-brown dwarf binary and a further two as extremely low-mass white dwarf binaries. We also provide identification spectroscopy for 17 of our 18 binaries. Running our search method on mock light curves with real ZTF sampling, we estimate our efficiency of detecting objects with light curves similar to the ones of the newly discovered binaries. Many more binaries are to be found in the ZTF footprint as the data releases grow, so our survey is ongoing.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.4171K,[]
ASAS-SN search for optical counterparts of gravitational-wave events from the third observing run of Advanced LIGO/Virgo,"We report on the search for electromagnetic counterparts to the nine gravitational-wave events with a >60 per cent probability of containing a neutron star during the third observing run (O3) of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)-Virgo Collaboration (LVC) with the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN). No optical counterparts associated with a gravitational-wave event were found. However, thanks to its network of telescopes, the average area visible to at least one ASAS-SN site during the first 10 h after the trigger contained ~30 per cent of the integrated source location probability. Through a combination of normal operations and target-of-opportunity observations, ASAS-SN observations of the highest probability fields began within 1 h of the trigger for four of the events. After 24 h, ASAS-SN observed >60 per cent of total probability for three events and >40 per cent for all but one of the events. This is the largest area coverage to a depth of g = 18.5 mag from any survey with published coverage statistics for seven of the nine events. With its observing strategy, five sites around the world, and a large field of view, ASAS-SN will be one of the leading surveys to optically search for nearby neutron star mergers during LVC fourth observation run (O4).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.3427D,[]
Variable star classification across the Galactic bulge and disc with the VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea survey,"We present VIVACE, the VIrac VAriable Classification Ensemble, a catalogue of variable stars extracted from an automated classification pipeline for the Vista Variables in the Vía Láctea (VVV) infrared survey of the Galactic bar/bulge and southern disc. Our procedure utilizes a two-stage hierarchical classifier to first isolate likely variable sources using simple variability summary statistics and training sets of non-variable sources from the Gaia early third data release, and then classify candidate variables using more detailed light-curve statistics and training labels primarily from OGLE and VSX. The methodology is applied to point-spread-function photometry for ~490 million light curves from the VIRAC v2 astrometric and photometric catalogue resulting in a catalogue of ~1.4 million likely variable stars, of which ~39 000 are high-confidence (classification probability >0.9) RR Lyrae ab stars, ~8000 RR Lyrae c/d stars, ~187, 000 detached/semi-detached eclipsing binaries, ~18, 000 contact eclipsing binaries, ~1400 classical Cepheid variables and ~2200 Type II Cepheid variables. Comparison with OGLE-4 suggests a completeness of around $90\, \, \mathrm{per\, cent}$ for RRab and $\lesssim 60\, \mathrm{per\, cent}$ for RRc/d, and a misclassification rate for known RR Lyrae stars of around $1\, \mathrm{per\, cent}$ for the high confidence sample. We close with two science demonstrations of our new VIVACE catalogue: first, a brief investigation of the spatial and kinematic properties of the RR Lyrae stars within the disc/bulge, demonstrating the spatial elongation of bar-bulge RR Lyrae stars is in the same sense as the more metal-rich red giant population whilst having a slower rotation rate of $\sim \!40\, \mathrm{km\, s}^{-1}\mathrm{kpc}^{-1}$; and secondly, an investigation of the GaiaEDR3 parallax zero-point using contact eclipsing binaries across the Galactic disc plane and bulge.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.2566M,[]
Minute-cadence observations of the LAMOST fields with the TMTS: I. Methodology of detecting short-period variables and results from the first-year survey,"Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescopes for Survey (TMTS), located at Xinglong Station of NAOC, has a field of view up to 18 deg<SUP>2</SUP>. The TMTS has started to monitor the LAMOST sky areas since 2020, with the uninterrupted observations lasting for about 6 h on average for each sky area and a cadence of about 1 min. Here, we introduce the data analysis and preliminary scientific results for the first-year observations, which covered 188 LAMOST plates ($\approx 1970\, {\rm deg}^2$). These observations have generated over 4.9 million uninterrupted light curves, with at least 100 epochs for each of them. These light curves correspond to 4.26 million Gaia-DR2 sources, among which 285 thousand sources are found to have multi-epoch spectra from the LAMOST. By analysing these light curves with the Lomb-Scargle periodograms, we identify more than 3700 periodic variable star candidates with periods below ≈7.5 h, primarily consisting of eclipsing binaries and δ Scuti stars. Those short-period binaries will provide important constraints on theories of binary evolution and possible sources for space gravitational wave experiments in the future. Moreover, we also identified 42 flare stars by searching rapidly evolving signals in the light curves. The densely sampled light curves from the TMTS allow us to better quantify the shapes and durations for these flares.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.2362L,[]
Light-curve fingerprints: an automated approach to the extraction of X-ray variability patterns with feature aggregation - an example application to GRS 1915+105,"Time series data mining is an important field of research in the era of 'Big Data'. Next generation astronomical surveys will generate data at unprecedented rates, creating the need for automated methods of data analysis. We propose a method of light-curve characterization that employs a pipeline consisting of a neural network with a long-short term memory variational autoencoder architecture and a Gaussian mixture model. The pipeline performs extraction and aggregation of features from light-curve segments into feature vectors of fixed length that we refer to as light-curve 'fingerprints'. This representation can be readily used as input of down-stream machine learning algorithms. We demonstrate the proposed method on a data set of Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of the Galactic black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105, which was chosen because of its observed complex X-ray variability. We find that the proposed method can generate a representation that characterizes the observations and reflects the presence of distinct classes of GRS 1915+105 X-ray flux variability. We find that this representation can be used to perform efficient classification of light curves. We also present how the representation can be used to quantify the similarity of different light curves, highlighting the problem of the popular classification system of GRS 1915+105 observations, which does not account for intermediate class behaviour.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.1269O,[]
El-CID: a filter for gravitational-wave electromagnetic counterpart identification,"As gravitational-wave (GW) interferometers become more sensitive and probe ever more distant reaches, the number of detected binary neutron star mergers will increase. However, detecting more events farther away with GWs does not guarantee corresponding increase in the number of electromagnetic counterparts of these events. Current and upcoming wide-field surveys that participate in GW follow-up operations will have to contend with distinguishing the kilonova (KN) from the ever increasing number of transients they detect, many of which will be consistent with the GW sky-localization. We have developed a novel tool based on a temporal convolutional neural network architecture, trained on sparse early-time photometry and contextual information for Electromagnetic Counterpart Identification (El-CID). The overarching goal for El-CID is to slice through list of new transient candidates that are consistent with the GW sky localization, and determine which sources are consistent with KNe, allowing limited target-of-opportunity resources to be used judiciously. In addition to verifying the performance of our algorithm on an extensive testing sample, we validate it on AT2017gfo - the only EM counterpart of a binary neutron star merger discovered to date - and AT2019npv - a supernova that was initially suspected as a counterpart of the GW event, GW190814, but was later ruled out after further analysis.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509..914C,[]
Astrometric and Photometric Standard Candidates for the Upcoming 4-m International Liquid Mirror Telescope Survey,"The International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT) is a 4-m class survey telescope that has recently achieved first light and is expected to swing into full operations by January 1, 2023. It scans the sky in a fixed 22′ wide strip centered at the declination of 29∘21′41′′ and works in Time Delay Integration (TDI) mode. We present a full catalog of sources in the ILMT strip that can serve as astrometric calibrators. The characteristics of the sources for astrometric calibration are extracted from Gaia EDR3 as it provides a very precise measurement of astrometric properties such as RA (α), Dec (δ), parallax (π), and proper motions (μα∗ & μδ). We have crossmatched the Gaia EDR3 with SDSS DR17 and PanSTARRS-1 (PS1) and supplemented the catalog with apparent magnitudes of these sources in g,r, and i filters. We also present a catalog of spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) magnitudes that may serve as photometric calibrators.

A photometric study of members of the NEOs Atiras population,"The observation of objects of the Atiras population is a challenge due to the narrow time-window in which observations are possible and, even so, at very low altitudes. This is due to the orbit of these objects, internal to that of the Earth. In this work we present the results of a photometric observational campaign of Atiras aiming to determine their physical parameters using the rotational light curve, the solar phase curve and the photometric spectrum. The period and amplitude have been determined for the asteroids (163693) Atira, (413563) 2005 TG45 and 2017 YH. In the case of (163693) Atira, we have determined a plausible rotational period P = 3 . 1532 ± 0 . 0001 , where the composite light curve presents structure usually related to the presence of a companion, as it has been suggested by radar observations of this asteroid. For asteroids (163693) Atira, (413563) 2005 TG45, (481817) 2008 UL90 and 2018 JB3 it was possible to derive the absolute magnitude and the phase coefficient. The obtained values are similar to those observed for asteroids with intermediate to low albedo. Finally, for asteroid (163693) Atira we have obtained a featureless photometric spectrum which is compatible in the Carvano taxonomic scheme with the Xp, Dp or Cp classes.

Simulated SPHEREx spectra of asteroids and their implications for asteroid size and reflectance estimation,"We describe the construction and analysis of simulated SPHEREx spectra of Main Belt and Trojan asteroids. SPHEREx will deliver the first all-sky spectral survey at 96 spectral channels between 0.75 μm and 5.0 μm. We have developed a method for correcting SPHEREx asteroid spectra for intrinsic rotational variability that does not require light curves and can enable studies before LSST light curves become available for this purpose. Using these spectra, we predict that SPHEREx will deliver meaningful flux measurements for about 100,000 asteroids, including close to 10,000 objects with high-quality spectra; this dataset will represent an increase over our current sample size by more than an order of magnitude. The main SPHEREx contribution to asteroid science will be derived from taxonomic classifications, detailed spectroscopic analyses involving a number of diagnostic spectral features associated with olivine, pyroxene, hydroxyl, water ice, and organics, and constraints on thermal properties. We argue that all asteroids with currently known orbits, about a million objects, should be included in the SPHEREx forced photometry object list to maximize its science impact.

Never bet against Einstein,"Among the geniuses of mankind, Einstein was probably one of those who made more erroneous claims, and often changed his opinion during the years on important scientific subjects. However, it is important to bear in mind that his mistakes were always due to a misinterpretation of the results obtained from his equations, since he was often biased by his own view of the universe. Einstein’s equations have always given the correct answer and, till now, more than a century after its development, there is no evidence that it may not be correct.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022IJMPD..3140014D,[]
The science case for LIGO-India,"The global network of gravitational-wave detectors has completed three observing runs with ~50 detections of merging compact binaries. A third LIGO detector, with comparable astrophysical reach, is to be built in India (LIGO-Aundha) and expected to be operational during the latter part of this decade. Such additions to the network increase the number of baselines and the network SNR of GW events. These enhancements help improve the sky-localization of those events. Multiple detectors simultaneously in operation will also increase the baseline duty factor, thereby, leading to an improvement in the detection rates and, hence, the completeness of surveys. In this paper, we quantify the improvements due to the expansion of the LIGO global network in the precision with which source properties will be measured. We also present examples of how this expansion will give a boost to tests of fundamental physics.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022CQGra..39b5004S,[]
Mid-infrared Outbursts in Nearby Galaxies (MIRONG). II. Optical Spectroscopic Follow-up,"Infrared echo has proven to be an effective means to discover transient accretion events of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), such as tidal disruption events (TDEs) and changing-look active galactic nuclei (AGNs), in dusty circumnuclear environments. To explore the dusty populations of SMBH transient events, we have constructed a large sample of mid-infrared outbursts in nearby galaxies (MIRONG) and performed multiwavelength observations. Here we present the results of multiepoch spectroscopic follow-up observations of a subsample of 54 objects spanning a timescale of 4 yr. Emission-line variability was detected in 22 of them with either emergence or enhancement of broad Balmer emission lines in comparison with pre-outburst spectra. Coronal lines, He II λ4686, and Bowen line N III λ4640 appeared in the spectra of nine, seven, and two sources, respectively. These results suggest that MIRONG is a mixed bag of different transient sources. We have tentatively classified them into different subclass according to their spectral evolution and light curves. Two sources have been in a steady high broad Hα flux up to the latest observation and might be turn-on AGNs. Broad lines faded out in the remaining sources, indicating a transient ionizing source ignited by TDE or sporadic gas accretion. Thirty-one sources do not show noticeable spectral change with respect to their pre-outburst spectra. They have a statistically redder MIR color and lower MIR luminosity of the outbursts, which are consistent with heavily obscured events.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..258...21W,[]
The Milky Way Revealed by Variable Stars. I. Sample Selection of RR Lyrae Stars and Evidence for Merger History,"In order to study the Milky Way, RR Lyrae (RRL) variable stars identified by Gaia, ASAS-SN, and ZTF sky survey projects have been analyzed as tracers in this work. Photometric and spectroscopic information of 3417 RRLs including proper motions, radial velocity, and metallcity are obtained from observational data of Gaia, LAMOST, GALAH, APOGEE, and RAVE. Precise distances of RRLs with typical uncertainties less than 3% are derived by using a recent comprehensive period-luminosity-metallicity relation. Our results from kinematical and chemical analysis provide important clues for the assembly history of the Milky Way, especially for the Gaia-Sausage ancient merger. The kinematical and chemical trends found in this work are consistent with those of recent simulations that indicated that the Gaia-Sausage merger had a dual origin in the Galactic thick disk and halo. As recent similar works have found, the halo RRL sample in this work contains a subset of radially biased orbits besides a more isotropic component. This higher orbital anisotropy component amounts to β ≃ 0.8, and it contributes between 42% and 83% of the halo RRLs at 4 < R( kpc) < 20.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..258...20A,[]

Instead of keeping to the widely used discrete classes, we propose a binary star morphology classification based on a dimensionality reduction algorithm. Finally, we present statistical properties of the sample, we qualitatively estimate completeness, and we discuss the results. The work presented here is organized and performed within the TESS Eclipsing Binary Working Group, an open group of professional and citizen scientists; we conclude by describing ongoing work and future goals for the group. The catalog is available from http://tessEBs.villanova.edu and from MAST.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..258...16P,[]
Give Me a Few Hours: Exploring Short Timescales in Rubin Observatory Cadence Simulations,The limiting temporal resolution of a time-domain survey in detecting transient behavior is set by the time between observations of the same sky area. We analyze the distribution of visit separations for a range of Vera C. Rubin Observatory cadence simulations. Simulations from families v1.5-v1.7.1 are strongly peaked at the 22 minute visit pair separation and provide effectively no constraint on temporal evolution within the night. This choice will necessarily prevent Rubin from discovering a wide range of astrophysical phenomena in time to trigger rapid follow-up. We present a science-agnostic metric to supplement detailed simulations of fast-evolving transients and variables and suggest potential approaches for improving the range of timescales explored.,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..258...13B,[]
Optimizing Cadences with Realistic Light-curve Filtering for Serendipitous Kilonova Discovery with Vera Rubin Observatory,"Current and future optical and near-infrared wide-field surveys have the potential to find kilonovae, the optical and infrared counterparts to neutron star mergers, independently of gravitational-wave or high-energy gamma-ray burst triggers. The ability to discover fast and faint transients such as kilonovae largely depends on the area observed, the depth of those observations, the number of revisits per field in a given time frame, and the filters adopted by the survey; it also depends on the ability to perform rapid follow-up observations to confirm the nature of the transients. In this work, we assess kilonova detectability in existing simulations of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time strategy for the Vera C. Rubin Wide Fast Deep survey, with focus on comparing rolling to baseline cadences. Although currently available cadences can enable the detection of >300 kilonovae out to ~1400 Mpc over the 10 year survey, we can expect only 3-32 kilonovae similar to GW170817 to be recognizable as fast-evolving transients. We also explore the detectability of kilonovae over the plausible parameter space, focusing on viewing angle and ejecta masses. We find that observations in redder izy bands are crucial for identification of nearby (within 300 Mpc) kilonovae that could be spectroscopically classified more easily than more distant sources. Rubin's potential for serendipitous kilonova discovery could be increased by gain of efficiency with the employment of individual 30 s exposures (as opposed to 2 × 15 s snap pairs), with the addition of red-band observations coupled with same-night observations in g or r bands, and possibly with further development of a new rolling-cadence strategy.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..258....5A,[]
Near-Chandrasekhar-mass Type Ia Supernovae from the Double-degenerate Channel,"Recent observational evidence has demonstrated that white dwarf (WD) mergers are a highly efficient mechanism for mass accretion onto WDs in the galaxy. In this paper, we show that WD mergers naturally produce highly magnetized, uniformly rotating WDs, including a substantial population within a narrow mass range close to the Chandrasekhar mass (M <SUB>Ch</SUB>). These near-M <SUB>Ch</SUB> WD mergers subsequently undergo rapid spin up and compression on a ~ 10<SUP>2</SUP> yr timescale, either leading to central ignition and a normal SN Ia via the DDT mechanism, or alternatively to a failed detonation and SN Iax through pure deflagration. The resulting SNe Ia and SNe Iax will have spectra, light curves, polarimetry, and nucleosynthetic yields similar to those predicted to arise through the canonical near-M <SUB>Ch</SUB> single degenerate (SD) channel, but with a t <SUP>-1</SUP> delay time distribution characteristic of the double-degenerate channel. Furthermore, in contrast to the SD channel, WD merger near-M <SUB>Ch</SUB> SNe Ia and SNe Iax will not produce observable companion signatures. We discuss a range of implications of these findings, from SNe Ia explosion mechanisms, to galactic nucleosynthesis of iron peak elements including manganese.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925...92N,[]
Formation of the Double White Dwarf Binary PTF J0533+0209 through Stable Mass Transfer?,"Double white dwarf (DWD) binaries are important for studies of common-envelope (CE) evolution, Type Ia supernova progenitors and Galactic sources of low-frequency gravitational waves. PTF J0533+0209 is a DWD system with a short orbital period of P <SUB>orb</SUB> ~ 20 minutes and thus a so-called LISA verification source. The formation of this system and other DWDs is still under debate. In this paper, we discuss the possible formation scenarios of this binary and argue that it is not likely to have formed through CE evolution. Applying a new magnetic-braking prescription, we use the MESA code to model the formation of this system through stable mass transfer. We find a model that can well reproduce the observed WD masses and orbital period but not the effective temperature and hydrogen abundance of the low-mass He WD component. We discuss the possibility of using H flashes to mitigate this discrepancy. Finally, we discuss the future evolution of this system into an AM CVn binary such as those that will be detected by spaceborne GW observatories like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925...89C,[]
The UV/Optical Peak and X-Ray Brightening in TDE Candidate AT 2019azh: A Case of Stream-Stream Collision and Delayed Accretion,"We present and analyze the optical/UV and X-ray observations of a nearby tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate, AT 2019azh, from ~30 days before to ~400 days after its early optical peak. The X-rays show a late brightening by a factor of ~30-100 around 200 days after discovery, while the UV/opticals continuously decayed. The early X-rays show two flaring episodes of variation, temporally uncorrelated with the early UV/opticals. We found a clear sign of X-ray hardness evolution; i.e., the source is harder at early times and becomes softer as it brightens later. The drastically different temporal behaviors in X-rays and UV/opticals suggest that the two bands are physically distinct emission components and probably arise from different locations. These properties argue against the reprocessing of X-rays by any outflow as the origin of the UV/optical peak. The full data are best explained by a two-process scenario, in which the UV/optical peak is produced by the debris stream-stream collisions during the circularization phase; some shocked gas with low angular momentum forms an early, low-mass ""precursor"" accretion disk that emits the early X-rays. The major body of the disk is formed after the circularization finishes, whose enhanced accretion rate produces the late X-ray brightening. Event AT 2019azh is a strong case of a TDE whose emission signatures of stream-stream collision and delayed accretion are both identified.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925...67L,[]
Inferring Kilonova Population Properties with a Hierarchical Bayesian Framework. I. Nondetection Methodology and Single-event Analyses,"We present nimbus: a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer the intrinsic luminosity parameters of kilonovae (KNe) associated with gravitational-wave (GW) events, based purely on nondetections. This framework makes use of GW 3D distance information and electromagnetic upper limits from multiple surveys for multiple events and self-consistently accounts for the finite sky coverage and probability of astrophysical origin. The framework is agnostic to the brightness evolution assumed and can account for multiple electromagnetic passbands simultaneously. Our analyses highlight the importance of accounting for model selection effects, especially in the context of nondetections. We show our methodology using a simple, two-parameter linear brightness model, taking the follow-up of GW190425 with the Zwicky Transient Facility as a single-event test case for two different prior choices of model parameters: (i) uniform/uninformative priors and (ii) astrophysical priors based on surrogate models of Monte Carlo radiative-transfer simulations of KNe. We present results under the assumption that the KN is within the searched region to demonstrate functionality and the importance of prior choice. Our results show consistency with simsurvey-an astronomical survey simulation tool used previously in the literature to constrain the population of KNe. While our results based on uniform priors strongly constrain the parameter space, those based on astrophysical priors are largely uninformative, highlighting the need for deeper constraints. Future studies with multiple events having electromagnetic follow-up from multiple surveys should make it possible to constrain the KN population further.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925...58M,[]
"Follow-up Observations of the Prolonged, Super-Eddington, Tidal Disruption Event Candidate 3XMM J150052.0+015452: the Slow Decline Continues","The X-ray source 3XMM J150052.0+015452 was discovered as a spectacular tidal disruption event candidate during a prolonged (>11 yr) outburst. It exhibited unique quasi-soft X-ray spectra of characteristic temperature kT ~ 0.3 keV for several years at the peak, but in a recent Chandra observation (10 yr into the outburst) a super-soft X-ray spectrum of kT ~ 0.15 keV was detected. Such dramatic spectral softening could signal the transition from the super-Eddington to thermal state or the temporary presence of a warm absorber. Here we report on our study of four new XMM-Newton follow-up observations of the source. We found that they all showed super-soft spectra, suggesting that the source had remained super-soft for >5 yr. Then its spectral change is best explained as due to the super-Eddington to thermal spectral state transition. The fits to the thermal-state spectra suggested a smaller absorption toward the source than that obtained in Lin et al. This led us to update the modeling of the event as due to the disruption of a 0.75 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> star by a massive black hole of a few × 10<SUP>5</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. We also obtained two HST images in the F606W and F814W filters and found that the dwarf star-forming host galaxy can be resolved into a dominant disk and a smaller bulge. No central point source was clearly seen in either filter, ruling out strong optical emission associated with the X-ray activity.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...924L..35L,[]
Impact of the SpaceX Starlink Satellites on the Zwicky Transient Facility Survey Observations,"There is a growing concern about an impact of low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite constellations on ground-based astronomical observations, in particular, on wide-field surveys in the optical and infrared. The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), thanks to the large field of view of its camera, provides an ideal setup to study the effects of LEO megaconstellations-such as SpaceX's Starlink-on astronomical surveys. Here, we analyze the archival ZTF observations collected between 2019 November and 2021 September and find 5301 satellite streaks that can be attributed to Starlink satellites. We find that the number of affected images is increasing with time as SpaceX deploys more satellites. Twilight observations are particularly affected-a fraction of streaked images taken during twilight has increased from less than 0.5% in late 2019 to 18% in 2021 August. We estimate that once the size of the Starlink constellation reaches 10,000, essentially all ZTF images taken during twilight may be affected. However, despite the increase in satellite streaks observed during the analyzed period, the current science operations of ZTF are not yet strongly affected. We also find that redesigning Starlink satellites (by installing visors intended to block sunlight from reaching the satellite antennas to prevent reflection) reduces their brightness by a factor of 4.6 ± 0.1 with respect to the original design in g, r, and i bands.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...924L..30M,[]
Types of Transients in the Centers of Post-starburst and Quiescent Balmer-strong Galaxies,"Tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been found to show a preference for post-starburst (PS) and quiescent Balmer-strong (QBS) galaxies. This preference can be used to help find TDEs in transient surveys. But what other transients might ""contaminate"" such a search, and by how much? We examine all reported transients coincident with the centers of galaxies in the French & Zabludoff (2018) catalog of spectroscopically confirmed PS and QBS galaxies and photometrically identified PS and QBS galaxy candidates. We find that TDEs and Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are the only types of transients classified in the centers of these galaxies (aside from one active galactic nucleus flare), with Type Ia SNe being 8.3 ± 0.2 times more prevalent than TDEs (1σ confidence bounds). This factor is ~2.7 times lower than in a control sample of quiescent galaxies. Narrowing the sample to spectroscopically confirmed QBS galaxies does not change these statistics much. In spectroscopically confirmed PS galaxies, however, TDEs are the ones that outnumber Type Ia SNe 2 ± 0.6 to 1. Unfortunately, there are few such galaxies in the catalog. By classifying transients from the entire catalog, three times more TDEs are expected to be found, but with a ~16 times larger Type Ia SN contamination. We use the public ZTF photometric archive to search for possibly missed TDEs in the French & Zabludoff (2018) galaxies. We find three unclassified clear transients-none of which are likely missed TDEs based on their light-curve colors.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...924..121A,[]
A Detailed Analysis of GW190521 with Phenomenological Waveform Models,"In this paper we present an extensive analysis of the GW190521 gravitational wave event with the current (fourth) generation of phenomenological waveform models for binary black hole coalescences. GW190521 stands out from other events since only a few wave cycles are observable. This leads to a number of challenges, one being that such short signals are prone to not resolving approximate waveform degeneracies, which may result in multimodal posterior distributions. The family of waveform models we use includes a new fast time-domain model (IMRPHENOMTPHM), which allows us to extensively test different priors and robustness with respect to variations in the waveform model, including the content of spherical harmonic modes. We clarify some issues raised in a recent paper, Nitz & Capano, associated with possible support for a high-mass-ratio source, but confirm their finding of a multimodal posterior distribution, albeit with important differences in the statistical significance of the peaks. In particular, we find that the support for both masses being outside the pair instability supernova mass gap, and the support for an intermediate-mass-ratio binary are drastically reduced with respect to what Nitz & Capano found. We also provide updated probabilities for associating GW190521 to the potential electromagnetic counterpart from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Graham et al.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...924...79E,[]
An Early-time Optical and Ultraviolet Excess in the Type-Ic SN 2020oi,"We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of Supernova 2020oi (SN 2020oi), a nearby (~17 Mpc) type-Ic supernova (SN Ic) within the grand-design spiral M100. We undertake a comprehensive analysis to characterize the evolution of SN 2020oi and constrain its progenitor system. We detect flux in excess of the fireball rise model δ t ≈ 2.5 days from the date of explosion in multiband optical and UV photometry from the Las Cumbres Observatory and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, respectively. The derived SN bolometric luminosity is consistent with an explosion with M <SUB>ej</SUB> = 0.81 ± 0.03 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, E <SUB> k </SUB> = 0.79 ± 0.09 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, and M <SUB>Ni56</SUB> = 0.08 ± 0.02 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Inspection of the event's decline reveals the highest Δm <SUB>15,bol</SUB> reported for a stripped-envelope event to date. Modeling of optical spectra near event peak indicates a partially mixed ejecta comparable in composition to the ejecta observed in SN 1994I, while the earliest spectrum shows signatures of a possible interaction with material of a distinct composition surrounding the SN progenitor. Further, Hubble Space Telescope pre-explosion imaging reveals a stellar cluster coincident with the event. From the cluster photometry, we derive the mass and age of the SN progenitor using stellar evolution models implemented in the BPASS library. Our results indicate that SN 2020oi occurred in a binary system from a progenitor of mass M <SUB>ZAMS</SUB> ≈ 9.5 ± 1.0 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, corresponding to an age of 27 ± 7 Myr. SN 2020oi is the dimmest SN Ic event to date for which an early-time flux excess has been observed, and the first in which an early excess is unlikely to be associated with shock cooling.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...924...55G,[]
Data-driven Expectations for Electromagnetic Counterpart Searches Based on LIGO/Virgo Public Alerts,"Searches for electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational-wave signals have redoubled since the first detection in 2017 of a binary neutron star merger with a gamma-ray burst, optical/infrared kilonova, and panchromatic afterglow. Yet, one LIGO/Virgo observing run later, there has not yet been a second, secure identification of an electromagnetic counterpart. This is not surprising given that the localization uncertainties of events in LIGO and Virgo's third observing run, O3, were much larger than predicted. We explain this by showing that improvements in data analysis that now allow LIGO/Virgo to detect weaker and hence more poorly localized events have increased the overall number of detections, of which well-localized, gold-plated events make up a smaller proportion overall. We present simulations of the next two LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing runs, O4 and O5, that are grounded in the statistics of O3 public alerts. To illustrate the significant impact that the updated predictions can have, we study the follow-up strategy for the Zwicky Transient Facility. Realistic and timely forecasting of gravitational-wave localization accuracy is paramount given the large commitments of telescope time and the need to prioritize which events are followed up. We include a data release of our simulated localizations as a public proposal planning resource for astronomers.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...924...54P,[]
"Final Moments. I. Precursor Emission, Envelope Inflation, and Enhanced Mass Loss Preceding the Luminous Type II Supernova 2020tlf","We present panchromatic observations and modeling of supernova (SN) 2020tlf, the first normal Type II-P/L SN with confirmed precursor emission, as detected by the Young Supernova Experiment transient survey. Pre-SN activity was detected in riz-bands at -130 days and persisted at relatively constant flux until first light. Soon after discovery, ""flash"" spectroscopy of SN 2020tlf revealed narrow, symmetric emission lines that resulted from the photoionization of circumstellar material (CSM) shed in progenitor mass-loss episodes before explosion. Surprisingly, this novel display of pre-SN emission and associated mass loss occurred in a red supergiant (RSG) progenitor with zero-age main-sequence mass of only 10-12 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, as inferred from nebular spectra. Modeling of the light curve and multi-epoch spectra with the non-LTE radiative-transfer code CMFGEN and radiation-hydrodynamical code HERACLES suggests a dense CSM limited to r ≈ 10<SUP>15</SUP> cm, and mass-loss rate of 10<SUP>-2</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The luminous light-curve plateau and persistent blue excess indicates an extended progenitor, compatible with an RSG model with R <SUB>⋆</SUB> = 1100 R <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Limits on the shock-powered X-ray and radio luminosity are consistent with model conclusions and suggest a CSM density of ρ < 2 × 10<SUP>-16</SUP> g cm<SUP>-3</SUP> for distances from the progenitor star of r ≈ 5 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> cm, as well as a mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} 1.3\times {10}^{-5}\,{M}_{\odot }\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$ at larger distances. A promising power source for the observed precursor emission is the ejection of stellar material following energy disposition into the stellar envelope as a result of gravity waves emitted during either neon/oxygen burning or a nuclear flash from silicon combustion.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...924...15J,[]
The Hubble Constant from Strongly Lensed Supernovae with Standardizable Magnifications,"The dominant uncertainty in the current measurement of the Hubble constant (H <SUB>0</SUB>) with strong gravitational lensing time delays is attributed to uncertainties in the mass profiles of the main deflector galaxies. Strongly lensed supernovae (glSNe) can provide, in addition to measurable time delays, lensing magnification constraints when knowledge about the unlensed apparent brightness of the explosion is imposed. We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework to combine a data set of SNe that are not strongly lensed and a data set of strongly lensed SNe with measured time delays. We jointly constrain (i) H <SUB>0</SUB> using the time delays as an absolute distance indicator, (ii) the lens model profiles using the magnification ratio of lensed and unlensed fluxes on the population level, and (iii) the unlensed apparent magnitude distribution of the SN population and the redshift-luminosity relation of the relative expansion history of the universe. We apply our joint inference framework on a future expected data set of glSNe and forecast that a sample of 144 glSNe of Type Ia with well-measured time series and imaging data will measure H <SUB>0</SUB> to 1.5%. We discuss strategies to mitigate systematics associated with using absolute flux measurements of glSNe to constrain the mass density profiles. Using the magnification of SN images is a promising and complementary alternative to using stellar kinematics. Future surveys, such as the Rubin and Roman observatories, will be able to discover the necessary number of glSNe, and with additional follow-up observations, this methodology will provide precise constraints on mass profiles and H <SUB>0</SUB>.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...924....2B,[]
Characterizing Sparse Asteroid Light Curves with Gaussian Processes,"In the era of wide-field surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, sparse photometric measurements constitute an increasing percentage of asteroid observations, particularly for asteroids newly discovered in these large surveys. Follow-up observations to supplement these sparse data may be prohibitively expensive in many cases, so to overcome these sampling limitations, we introduce a flexible model based on Gaussian processes to enable Bayesian parameter inference of asteroid time-series data. This model is designed to be flexible and extensible, and can model multiple asteroid properties such as the rotation period, light-curve amplitude, changing pulse profile, and magnitude changes due to the phase-angle evolution at the same time. Here, we focus on the inference of rotation periods. Based on both simulated light curves and real observations from the Zwicky Transient Facility, we show that the new model reliably infers rotational periods from sparsely sampled light curves and generally provides well-constrained posterior probability densities for the model parameters. We propose this framework as an intermediate method between fast but very limited-period detection algorithms and much more comprehensive but computationally expensive shape-modeling based on ray-tracing codes.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163...29L,[]
Identify Light-curve Signals with Deep Learning Based Object Detection Algorithm. I. Transit Detection,"Deep learning techniques have been well explored in the transiting exoplanet field; however, previous work mainly focuses on classification and inspection. In this work, we develop a novel detection algorithm based on a well-proven object detection framework in the computer vision field. Through training the network on the light curves of the confirmed Kepler exoplanets, our model yields about 90% precision and recall for identifying transits with signal-to-noise ratio higher than 6 (set the confidence threshold to 0.6). Giving a slightly lower confidence threshold, recall can reach higher than 95%. We also transfer the trained model to the TESS data and obtain similar performance. The results of our algorithm match the intuition of the human visual perception and make it useful to find single-transiting candidates. Moreover, the parameters of the output bounding boxes can also help to find multiplanet systems. Our network and detection functions are implemented in the Deep-Transit toolkit, which is an open-source Python package hosted on Github and PyPI.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163...23C,[]
GPU-enabled searches for periodic signals of unknown shape,"Recent and future generation observatories will enable the study of variable astronomical phenomena through their time-domain capabilities. High temporal fidelity will allow for unprecedented investigations into the nature of variable objects - those objects that vary in brightness over time. A major bottleneck in data processing pipelines is constructing light curve solutions for catalogs of variable objects, as it is well-known that period finding algorithms are computationally expensive. Furthermore, there are many period finding algorithms that are often suited for specific science cases. In this paper, we present the first GPU-accelerated Super Smoother algorithm. Super Smoother is general purpose and uses cross-validation to fit line segments to a time series, and as such, is more computationally expensive than other algorithms, such as Lomb-Scargle. Because the algorithm requires making several scans over the input time series for a tested frequency, we also propose a novel generalized-validation variant of Super Smoother that only requires a single scan over the data. We compare the performance of our algorithms to analogous parallel multi-core CPU implementations on three catalogs of data, and show that it is generally advantageous to use the GPU algorithm over the CPU counterparts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our single-pass variant of Super Smoother is roughly equally as accurate at finding correct period solutions as the original algorithm. Our software supports several features, such as batching the computation to eliminate the possibility of exceeding global memory on the GPU, processing a single object or batches of objects, and we allow for scaling the algorithm across multiple GPUs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&C....3800511G,[]
Maximum luminosities of normal stripped-envelope supernovae are brighter than explosion models allow,"Context. Stripped-envelope supernovae (SE SNe) of Type Ib and Type Ic are thought to be the result of explosions of massive stars that have lost their outer envelopes. The favored explosion mechanism is via core-collapse, with the shock later revived by neutrino heating. However, there is an upper limit to the amount of radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni that such models can accommodate.

Aims: We used a well-characterized sample of SE SNe from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey (BTS) to scrutinize the observational caveats regarding estimates of the maximum luminosity (and thus the amount of ejected radioactive nickel) for the sample members.,,,[]
"Methods: We employed the strict selection criteria for the BTS to collect a sample of spectroscopically classified normal Type Ibc SNe, for which we used the ZTF light curves to determine the maximum luminosity. We culled the sample further based on data quality, shape of the light curves, distances, and colors. Then we examined the uncertainties that may affect the measurements. The methodology of the sample construction based on this BTS sample can be used for other future investigations.",,,[]
"Results: We analyzed the observational data, consisting of optical light curves and spectra, for the selected sub-samples. In total, we used 129 Type Ib or Type Ic BTS SNe with an initial rough luminosity distribution peaking at M<SUB>r</SUB> = −17.61 ± 0.72, and where 36% are apparently brighter than the theoretically predicted maximum brightness of M<SUB>r</SUB> = −17.8. When we further culled this sample to ensure that the SNe are normal Type Ibc with good LC data within the Hubble flow, the sample of 94 objects gives M<SUB>r</SUB> = −17.64 ± 0.54. A main uncertainty in absolute magnitude determinations for SNe is the host galaxy extinction correction, but the reddened objects only get more luminous after corrections. If we simply exclude red objects, or those with unusual or uncertain colors, then we are left with 14 objects at M<SUB>r</SUB> = −17.90 ± 0.73, whereof a handful are most certainly brighter than the suggested theoretical limit. The main result of this study is thus that normal SNe Ibc do indeed reach luminosities above 10<SUP>42.6</SUP> erg s<SUP>−1</SUP>, which is apparently in conflict with existing explosion models.",,,[]

LAMOST Time-Domain survey: first results of four K2 plates,"From Oct. 2019 to Apr. 2020, LAMOST performed a time-domain (TD) spectroscopic survey of four K2 plates with both low- and medium-resolution observations. The low-resolution spectroscopic survey acquired 282 exposures ( ≈ 46.6 h) over 25 nights, yielding a total of about 767 000 spectra, and the medium-resolution survey took 177 exposures ( ≈ 49.1 h) over 27 nights, collecting about 478 000 spectra. More than 70%/50% of low-resolution/medium-resolution spectra have signal-to-noise ratio higher than 10. We determine stellar parameters (e.g., T <SUB>eff</SUB>, log g, [Fe/H]) and radial velocity (RV) with different methods, including LASP, DD-Payne and SLAM. In general, these parameter estimations from different methods show good agreement, and the stellar parameter values are consistent with those of APOGEE. We use the Gaia DR2 RV values to calculate a median RV zero point (RVZP) for each spectrograph exposure by exposure, and the RVZP-corrected RVs agree well with the APOGEE data. The stellar evolutionary and spectroscopic masses are estimated based on the stellar parameters, multi-band magnitudes, distances and extinction values. Finally, we construct a binary catalog including about 2700 candidates by analyzing their light curves, fitting the RV data, calculating the binarity parameters from medium-resolution spectra and cross-matching the spatially resolved binary catalog from Gaia EDR3.

A method for finding anomalous astronomical light curves and their analogues,"Our understanding of the Universe has profited from deliberate targeted studies of known phenomena, as well as from serendipitous unexpected discoveries, such as the discovery of a complex variability pattern in the direction of KIC 8462852 (Boyajian's star). Upcoming surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time will explore the parameter space of astrophysical transients at all time-scales, and offer the opportunity to discover even more extreme examples of unexpected phenomena. We investigate strategies to identify novel objects and to contextualize them within large time-series data sets in order to facilitate the discovery of new classes of objects as well as the physical interpretation of their anomalous nature. We develop a method that combines tree-based and manifold-learning algorithms for anomaly detection in order to perform two tasks: 1) identify and rank anomalous objects in a time-domain data set; and 2) group those anomalies according to their similarity in order to identify analogues. We achieve the latter by combining an anomaly score from a tree-based method with a dimensionality manifold-learning reduction strategy. Clustering in the reduced space allows for the successful identification of anomalies and analogues. We also assess the impact of pre-processing and feature engineering schemes and investigate the astrophysical nature of the objects that our models identify as anomalous by augmenting the Kepler data with Gaia colour and luminosity information. We find that multiple models, used in combination, are a promising strategy to identify novel light curves and light curve families.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.5734M,[]
Accretion of tidally disrupted asteroids on to white dwarfs: direct accretion versus disc processing,"Atmospheric heavy elements have been observed in more than a quarter of white dwarfs (WDs) at different cooling ages, indicating ongoing accretion of asteroidal material, whilst only a few per cent of the WDs possess a dust disc, and all these WDs are accreting metals. Here, assuming that a rubble-pile asteroid is scattered inside a WD's Roche lobe by a planet, we study its tidal disruption and the long-term evolution of the resulting fragments. We find that after a few pericentric passages, the asteroid is shredded into its constituent particles, forming a flat, thin ring. On a time-scale of Myr, tens of per cent of the particles are scattered on to the WD, and are therefore directly accreted without first passing through a circularized close-in disc. Fragment mutual collisions are most effective for coplanar fragments, and are thus only important in 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> yr before the orbital coplanarity is broken by the planet. We show that for a rubble pile asteroid with a size frequency distribution of the component particles following that of the near earth objects, it has to be roughly at least 10 km in radius such that enough fragments are generated and $\ge 10{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of its mass is lost to mutual collisions. At relative velocities of tens of km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, such collisions grind down the tidal fragments into smaller and smaller dust grains. The WD radiation forces may shrink those grains' orbits, forming a dust disc. Tidal disruption of a monolithic asteroid creates large km-size fragments, and only parent bodies ≥100 km are able to generate enough fragments for mutual collisions to be significant. Hence, those large asteroids experience a disc phase before being accreted.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.5671L,[]
"Real-time discovery of AT2020xnd: a fast, luminous ultraviolet transient with minimal radioactive ejecta","The many unusual properties of the enigmatic AT2018cow suggested that at least some subset of the empirical class of fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) represents a genuinely new astrophysical phenomenon. Unfortunately, the intrinsic rarity and fleeting nature of these events have made it difficult to identify additional examples early enough to acquire the observations necessary to constrain theoretical models. We present here the Zwicky Transient Facility discovery of AT2020xnd (ZTF20acigmel, the 'Camel') at z = 0.243, the first unambiguous AT2018cow analogue to be found and confirmed in real time. AT2018cow and AT2020xnd share all key observational properties: a fast optical rise, sustained high photospheric temperature, absence of a second peak attributable to ejection of a radioactively heated stellar envelope, extremely luminous radio, millimetre, and X-ray emission, and a dwarf-galaxy host. This supports the argument that AT2018cow-like events represent a distinct phenomenon from slower-evolving radio-quiet supernovae, likely requiring a different progenitor or a different central engine. The sample properties of the four known members of this class to date disfavour tidal disruption models but are consistent with the alternative model of an accretion powered jet following the direct collapse of a massive star to a black hole. Contextual filtering of alert streams combined with rapid photometric verification using multiband imaging provides an efficient way to identify future members of this class, even at high redshift.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.5138P,[]
Transitional events in the spectrophotometric regime between stripped envelope and superluminous supernovae,"The division between stripped-envelope supernovae (SE-SNe) and superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) is not well-defined in either photometric or spectroscopic space. While a sharp luminosity threshold has been suggested, there remains an increasing number of transitional objects that reach this threshold without the spectroscopic signatures common to SLSNe. In this work, we present data and analysis on four SNe transitional between SE-SNe and SLSNe; the He-poor SNe 2019dwa and 2019cri, and the He-rich SNe 2019hge and 2019unb. Each object displays long-lived and variable photometric evolution with luminosities around the SLSN threshold of M<SUB>r</SUB> < -19.8 mag. Spectroscopically however, these objects are similar to SE-SNe, with line velocities lower than either SE-SNe and SLSNe, and thus represent an interesting case of rare transitional events.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.4342P,[]
Birth of the ELMs: a ZTF survey for evolved cataclysmic variables turning into extremely low-mass white dwarfs,"We present a systematic survey for mass-transferring and recently detached cataclysmic variables (CVs) with evolved secondaries, which are progenitors of extremely low mass white dwarfs (ELM WDs), AM CVn systems, and detached ultracompact binaries. We select targets below the main sequence in the Gaia colour-magnitude diagram with ZTF light curves showing large-amplitude ellipsoidal variability and orbital period P<SUB>orb</SUB> < 6 h. This yields 51 candidates brighter than G = 18, of which we have obtained many-epoch spectra for 21. We confirm all 21 to be completely or nearly Roche lobe filling close binaries. Thirteen show evidence of ongoing mass transfer, which has likely just ceased in the other eight. Most of the secondaries are hotter than any previously known CV donors, with temperatures 4700 < T<SUB>eff</SUB>/K < 8000. Remarkably, all secondaries with $T_{\rm eff} rsim 7000\, \rm K$ appear to be detached, while all cooler secondaries are still mass-transferring. This transition likely marks the temperature where magnetic braking becomes inefficient due to loss of the donor's convective envelope. Most of the proto-WD secondaries have masses near $0.15\, \rm M_{\odot }$; their companions have masses near $0.8\, \rm M_{\odot }$. We infer a space density of $\sim 60\, \rm kpc^{-3}$, roughly 80 times lower than that of normal CVs and three times lower than that of ELM WDs. The implied Galactic birth rate, $\mathcal {R}\sim 60\, \rm Myr^{-1}$, is half that of AM CVn binaries. Most systems are well-described by MESA models for CVs in which mass transfer begins only as the donor leaves the main sequence. All are predicted to reach minimum periods 5 ≲ P<SUB>orb</SUB> min<SUP>-1</SUP> ≲ 30 within a Hubble time, where they will become AM CVn binaries or merge. This sample triples the known evolved CV population and offers broad opportunities for improving understanding of the compact binary population.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.4106E,[]
Detection of periodic signals in AGN red noise light curves: empirical tests on the Auto-Correlation Function and Phase Dispersion Minimization,"Active galactic nucleus (AGN) emission is dominated by stochastic, aperiodic variability which overwhelms any periodic/quasi-periodic signal (QPO) if one is present. The Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) and Phase Dispersion Minimization (PDM) techniques have been used previously to claim detections of QPOs in AGN light curves. In this paper, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to empirically test QPO detection feasibility in the presence of red noise. Given the community's access to large data bases of monitoring light curves via large-area monitoring programmes, our goal is to provide guidance to those searching for QPOs via data trawls. We simulate evenly sampled pure red noise light curves to estimate false alarm probabilities; false positives in both tools tend to occur towards time-scales longer than (very roughly) one-third of the light-curve duration. We simulate QPOs mixed with pure red noise and determine the true-positive detection sensitivity; in both tools, it depends strongly on the relative strength of the QPO against the red noise and on the steepness of the red noise PSD slope. We find that extremely large values of peak QPO power relative to red noise (typically ~10<SUP>4-5</SUP>) are needed for a 99.7 per cent true-positive detection rate. Given that the true-positive detections using the ACF or PDM are generally rare to obtain, we conclude that period searches based on the ACF or PDM must be treated with extreme caution when the data quality is not good. We consider the feasibility of QPO detection in the context of highly inclined, periodically self-lensing supermassive black hole binaries.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.3975K,[]
First tidal disruption events discovered by SRG/eROSITA: X-ray/optical properties and X-ray luminosity function at z < 0.6,"We present the first sample of tidal disruption events (TDEs) discovered during the SRG all-sky survey. These 13 events were selected among X-ray transients detected in the 0° < l < 180° hemisphere by eROSITA during its second sky survey (2020 June 10 to December 14) and confirmed by optical follow-up observations. The most distant event occurred at z = 0.581. One TDE continued to brighten at least 6 months. The X-ray spectra are consistent with nearly critical accretion on to black holes of a few ×10<SUP>3</SUP> to $10^8\, \mathrm{ M}_\odot$, although supercritical accretion is possibly taking place. In two TDEs, a spectral hardening is observed 6 months after the discovery. Four TDEs showed an optical brightening apart from the X-ray outburst. The other nine TDEs demonstrate no optical activity. All 13 TDEs are optically faint, with L<SUB>g</SUB>/L<SUB>X</SUB> < 0.3 (L<SUB>g</SUB> and L<SUB>X</SUB> being the g band and 0.2-6 keV luminosity, respectively). We have constructed a TDE X-ray luminosity function, which can be fit by a power law with a slope of -0.6 ± 0.2, similar to the trend observed for optically selected TDEs. The total rate is estimated at (1.1 ± 0.5) × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> TDEs per galaxy per year, an order of magnitude lower than inferred from optical studies. This suggests that X-ray bright events constitute a minority of TDEs, consistent with models predicting that X-rays can only be observed from directions close to the axis of a thick accretion disc formed from the stellar debris. Our TDE detection threshold can be lowered by a factor of ~2, which should allow a detection of ~700 TDEs by the end of the SRG survey.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.3820S,[]
TACOS: TESS AM CVn Outbursts Survey,"Using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we are doing a systematic study of outbursting AM CVn systems to place some limits on the current outbursts models. We present the TESS light curve (LC) for 9 AM CVns showing both superoutbursts (SOs) and normal outbursts (NOs). The continuous coverage of the outbursts with TESS allows us to place stringent limits on the duration and structures of the SOs and the NOs. We present evidence that in at least some of the systems enhanced mass transfer (EMT) has to be taken into account to explain the observed LC of the SOs and rebrighthening phase after the SOs. For others, the colour evolution from simultaneous observations in g and r with ZTF differs from previously reported colour evolution of longer period AM CVns where EMT is responsible for the SO. We also find that due to the lack of sufficiently high cadence coverage the duration of many systems might have been overestimated in previous ground-based surveys. We report the SO duration for 6 AM CVns. We also found that precursors are a common feature of SOs in AM CVns and are seen in the LC of 5 of the 6 reported SOs. Finally, the 10-min and 2-min cadence LCs from TESS also allowed us to find two new candidate orbital periods of AM CVns, both of which are in reasonably good agreement with the predictions for their periods based on their past outburst histories.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.3275P,[]
Gravitational self-lensing in populations of massive black hole binaries,"The community may be on the verge of detecting low-frequency gravitational waves from massive black hole binaries (MBHBs), but no examples of binary active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been confirmed. Because MBHBs are intrinsically rare, the most promising detection methods utilize photometric data from all-sky surveys. Gravitational self-lensing has recently been proposed as a method of detecting AGN in close separation binaries. In this study, we calculate the detectability of lensing signatures in realistic populations of simulated MBHBs. Within our model assumptions, we find that VRO's LSST should be able to detect tens to hundreds of self-lensing binaries, with the rate uncertainty depending primarily on the orientation of AGN discs relative to their binary orbits. Roughly a quarter of lensing detectable systems should also show detectable Doppler boosting signatures. If AGN discs tend to be aligned with the orbit, lensing signatures are very nearly achromatic, while in misaligned configurations, the bluer optical bands are lensed more than redder ones. Whether substantial obscuring material (e.g. a dusty torus) will be present in close binaries remains uncertain, but our estimates suggest that a substantial fraction of systems would still be observable in this case.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.2524K,[]
Simulating highly eccentric common envelope jet supernova impostors,"We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of eccentric common envelope jet supernova (CEJSN) impostors, i.e. a neutron star that crosses through the envelope of a red supergiant star on a highly eccentric orbit and launches jets as it accretes mass from the envelope. Because of numerical limitations, we apply a simple prescription where we inject the assumed jets' power into two opposite conical regions inside the envelope. We find the outflow morphology to be very complicated, clumpy, and non-spherical, having a large-scale symmetry only about the equatorial plane. The outflow morphology can substantially differ between simulations that differ by their jets' power. We estimate by simple means the light curve to be very bumpy, to have a rise time of one to a few months, and to slowly decay in about a year to several years. These eccentric CEJSN impostors will be classified as 'gap' objects, i.e. having a luminosity between those of classical novae and typical supernovae (termed also ILOTs for intermediate luminosity optical transients). We strengthen a previous conclusion that CEJSN impostors might account for some peculiar ILOTs, in particular those that might repeat over time-scales of months to years.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508.2386S,[]

Current observations are insufficient to confidently associate the binary black hole merger GW190521 with AGN J124942.3 + 344929,"Recently, Graham et al (2020 arXiv:2006.14122) identified ZTF19abanrhr as a candidate electromagnetic counterpart to the binary black hole merger GW190521. The authors argue that the observations are consistent with a kicked binary black hole interacting with the accretion disk of the active galactic nucleus AGN J124942.3 + 344929. If a real association (rather than happenstance), this has implications for the sources of LIGO/Virgo binary mergers, future prospects for electromagnetic counterparts, and measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe. In this work, we provide an analysis of the multi-messenger coincident-significance based on the localisation overlap and find that, under optimistic assumptions, the odds of a common source for GW190521 and ZTF19abanrhr range between 1 and 12. These odds are strongly dependent on the waveform model and, with current models, are unable to consistently capture both the effects of precession and orbital eccentricity. We consider this insufficient evidence to warrant confidently associating GW190521 with ZTF19abanrhr and hence caution against any astrophysical conclusions based on the association.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021CQGra..38w5004A,[]
A Catalog of 323 Cataclysmic Variables from LAMOST DR6,"In this work, we present a catalog of cataclysmic variables (CVs) identified from the sixth data release (DR6) of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). To single out the CV spectra, we introduce a novel machine-learning algorithm called UMAP to screen out a total of 169,509 Hα emission spectra, and obtain a classification accuracy of the algorithm of over 99.6% from the cross-validation set. We then apply the template-matching program PyHammer v2.0 to the LAMOST spectra to obtain the optimal spectral type with metallicity, which help us identify the chromospherically active stars and potential binary stars from the 169,509 spectra. After visually inspecting all of the spectra, we identify 323 CV candidates from the LAMOST database, among them 52 objects are new. We further classify the new CV candidates in subtypes based on their spectral features, including five DN subtypes during outbursts, five NL subtypes, and four magnetic CVs (three AM Her type and one IP type). We also find two CVs that have been previously identified by photometry and confirm their previous classification with the LAMOST spectra.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..257...65S,[]
Masses of White Dwarf Binary Companions to Type Ia Supernovae Measured from Runaway Velocities,"The recently proposed ""dynamically driven double-degenerate double-detonation"" (D<SUP>6</SUP>) scenario posits that Type Ia supernovae (SNe) may occur during dynamically unstable mass transfer between two white dwarfs (WDs) in a binary. This scenario predicts that the donor WD may then survive the explosion and be released as a hypervelocity runaway, opening up the exciting possibility of identifying remnant stars from D<SUP>6</SUP> SNe and using them to study the physics of detonations that produce Type Ia SNe. Three candidate D<SUP>6</SUP> runaway objects have been identified in Gaia data. The observable runaway velocity of these remnant objects represents their orbital speed at the time of SN detonation. The orbital dynamics and Roche lobe geometry required in the D<SUP>6</SUP> scenario place specific constraints on the radius and mass of the donor WD that becomes the hypervelocity runaway. In this Letter, we calculate the radii required for D<SUP>6</SUP> donor WDs as a function of the runaway velocity. Using mass-radius relations for WDs, we then constrain the masses of the donor stars as well. With measured velocities for each of the three D<SUP>6</SUP> candidate objects based on Gaia EDR3, this work provides a new probe of the masses and mass ratios in WD binary systems that produce SN detonations and hypervelocity runaways.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923L..34B,[]
Constraints on the Electromagnetic Counterpart of the Neutron-star-Black-hole Merger GW200115,"We report the results of our follow-up campaign for the neutron-star-black-hole (NSBH) merger GW200115 detected during the O3 run of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. We obtained wide-field observations with the Deca-Degree Optical Transient Imager covering ~20% of the total probability area down to a limiting magnitude of w = 20.5 AB at ~23 hr after the merger. Our search for counterparts returns a single candidate (AT2020aeo), likely not associated with the merger. In total, only 25 sources of interest were identified by the community and later discarded as unrelated to the GW event. We compare our upper limits with the emission predicted by state-of-the-art kilonova simulations and disfavor high-mass ejecta (>0.1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>), indicating that the spin of the system is not particularly high. By combining our optical limits with gamma-ray constraints from Swift and Fermi, we disfavor the presence of a standard short-duration burst for viewing angles ≲15° from the jet axis. Our conclusions are, however, limited by the large localization region of this GW event, and accurate prompt positions remain crucial to improving the efficiency of follow-up efforts.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923L..32D,[]
Discovery of the Fastest Early Optical Emission from Overluminous SN Ia 2020hvf: A Thermonuclear Explosion within a Dense Circumstellar Environment,"In this Letter we report a discovery of a prominent flash of a peculiar overluminous Type Ia supernova, SN 2020hvf, in about 5 hr of the supernova explosion by the first wide-field mosaic CMOS sensor imager, the Tomo-e Gozen Camera. The fast evolution of the early flash was captured by intensive intranight observations via the Tomo-e Gozen high-cadence survey. Numerical simulations show that such a prominent and fast early emission is most likely generated from an interaction between 0.01 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> circumstellar material (CSM) extending to a distance of ~10<SUP>13</SUP> cm and supernova ejecta soon after the explosion, indicating a confined dense CSM formation at the final evolution stage of the progenitor of SN 2020hvf. Based on the CSM-ejecta interaction-induced early flash, the overluminous light curve, and the high ejecta velocity of SN 2020hvf, we suggest that the SN 2020hvf may originate from a thermonuclear explosion of a super-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (""super-M <SUB>Ch</SUB> WD""). Systematical investigations on explosion mechanisms and hydrodynamic simulations of the super-M <SUB>Ch</SUB> WD explosion are required to further test the suggested scenario and understand the progenitor of this peculiar supernova.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923L...8J,[]
An Isolated White Dwarf with a 70 s Spin Period,"We report the discovery of an isolated white dwarf with a spin period of 70 s. We obtained high-speed photometry of three ultramassive white dwarfs within 100 pc and discovered significant variability in one. SDSS J221141.80+113604.4 is a 1.27 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> (assuming a CO core) magnetic white dwarf that shows 2.9% brightness variations in the BG40 filter with a 70.32 ± 0.04 s period, becoming the fastest spinning isolated white dwarf currently known. A detailed model atmosphere analysis shows that it has a mixed hydrogen and helium atmosphere with a dipole field strength of B <SUB> d </SUB> = 15 MG. Given its large mass, fast rotation, strong magnetic field, unusual atmospheric composition, and relatively large tangential velocity for its cooling age, J2211+1136 displays all of the signatures of a double white dwarf merger remnant. Long-term monitoring of the spin evolution of J2211+1136 and other fast-spinning isolated white dwarfs opens a new discovery space for substellar and planetary mass companions around white dwarfs. In addition, the discovery of such fast rotators outside of the ZZ Ceti instability strip suggests that some should also exist within the strip. Hence, some of the monoperiodic variables found within the instability strip may be fast-spinning white dwarfs impersonating ZZ Ceti pulsators.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923L...6K,[]
"Swift/XRT Deep Galactic Plane Survey Discovery of a New Intermediate Polar Cataclysmic Variable, Swift J183920.1-045350","We report on the Swift/XRT Deep Galactic Plane Survey discovery and multiwavelength follow-up observations of a new intermediate polar (IP) cataclysmic variable, Swift J183920.1-045350. A 449.7 s spin period is found in XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data, accompanied by a 459.9 s optical period that is most likely the synodic, or beat period, produced from a 5.6 hr orbital period. The orbital period is seen with moderate significance in independent long-baseline optical photometry observations taken with the ZTF and SAAO telescopes. We find that the X-ray pulse fraction of the source decreases with increasing energy. The X-ray spectra are consistent with the presence of an Fe emission line complex with both local and interstellar absorption. In the optical spectra, strong Hα, H I, He I, and He II emission lines are observed, all common features in magnetic CVs. The source properties are thus typical of known IPs, with the exception of its estimated distance of ${2.26}_{-0.83}^{+1.93}$ kpc, which is larger than typical, extending the reach of the CV population in our Galaxy.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923..243G,[]
LTD064402+245919: A Subgiant with a 1-3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> Undetected Companion Identified from LAMOST-TD Data,"Single-line spectroscopic binaries have recently contributed to stellar-mass black hole discovery, independently of the X-ray transient method. We report the identification of a single-line binary system, LTD064402+245919, with an orbital period of 14.50 days. The observed component is a subgiant with a mass of 2.77 ± 0.68 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, radius 15.5 ± 2.5 R <SUB>⊙</SUB>, effective temperature T <SUB>eff</SUB> 4500 ± 200 K, and surface gravity log g 2.5 ± 0.25 dex. The discovery makes use of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope time-domain and Zwicky Transient Facility survey. Our general-purpose software pipeline applies a Lomb-Scargle periodogram to determine the orbital period and uses machine learning to classify the variable type from the folded light curves. We apply a combined model to estimate the orbital parameters from both the light and radial velocity curves, taking constraints on the primary star mass, mass function, and detection limit of secondary luminosity into consideration. We obtain a radial velocity semiamplitude of 44.6 ± 1.5 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, mass ratio of 0.73 ± 0.07, and an undetected component mass of 2.02 ± 0.49 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> when the type of the undetected component is not set. We conclude that the inclination is not well constrained, and that the secondary mass is larger than 1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> when the undetected component is modeled as a compact object. According to our investigations using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulation, increasing the spectra signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 3 would enable the secondary light to be distinguished (if present). The algorithm and software in this work are able to serve as general-purpose tools for the identification of compact objects quiescent in X-rays.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923..226Y,[]
Supercritical Accretion of Stellar-mass Compact Objects in Active Galactic Nuclei,"Accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been proposed as promising sites for producing both (stellar-mass) compact object mergers and extreme mass ratio inspirals. Along with disk-assisted migration, ambient gas inevitably accretes onto compact objects. In previous studies, it was commonly assumed that either an Eddington rate or a Bondi rate takes place, although they can differ by several orders of magnitude. As a result, the mass and spin evolution of compact objects within AGN disks are essentially unknown. In this work, we construct a relativistic supercritical inflow-outflow model for black hole (BH) accretion. We show that the radiation efficiency of the supercritical accretion of a stellar-mass BH (sBH) is generally too low to explain the proposed electromagnetic counterpart of GW 190521. Applying this model to sBHs embedded in AGN disks, we find that, although the gas inflow rates at Bondi radii of these sBHs are commonly highly super-Eddington, a large fraction of inflowing gas eventually escapes as outflows so that only a small fraction accretes onto the sBH, resulting in mildly super-Eddington BH absorption in most cases. We also apply this model to neutron stars (NSs) and white dwarfs (WDs) in AGN disks. It turns out to be difficult for WDs to grow to the Chandrasekhar limit via accretion because WDs are spun up more efficiently to reach the shedding limit before the Chandrasekhar limit. For NSs accretion-induced collapse is possible if NS magnetic fields are sufficiently strong to keep the NS slowly rotating during accretion.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923..173P,[]
V899 Mon: A Peculiar Eruptive Young Star Close to the End of Its Outburst,"The eruptive young star V899 Mon shows characteristics of both FUors and EXors. It reached a peak brightness in 2010, then briefly faded in 2011, followed by a second outburst. We conducted multifilter optical photometric monitoring, as well as optical and near-infrared spectroscopic observations, of V899 Mon. The light curves and color-magnitude diagrams show that V899 Mon has been gradually fading after its second outburst peak in 2018, but smaller accretion bursts are still happening. Our spectroscopic observations taken with Gemini/IGRINS and VLT/MUSE show a number of emission lines, unlike during the outbursting stage. We used the emission line fluxes to estimate the accretion rate and found that it has significantly decreased compared to the outbursting stage. The mass-loss rate is also weakening. Our 2D spectroastrometric analysis of emission lines recovered jet and disk emission of V899 Mon. We found that the emission from permitted metallic lines and the CO bandheads can be modeled well with a disk in Keplerian rotation, which also gives a tight constraint for the dynamical stellar mass of 2 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. After a discussion of the physical changes that led to the changes in the observed properties of V899 Mon, we suggest that this object is finishing its second outburst.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923..171P,[]
SN 2018agk: A Prototypical Type Ia Supernova with a Smooth Power-law Rise in Kepler (K2),"We present the 30 minutes cadence Kepler/K2 light curve of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2018agk, covering approximately one week before explosion, the full rise phase, and the decline until 40 days after peak. We additionally present ground-based observations in multiple bands within the same time range, including the 1 day cadence DECam observations within the first ~5 days after the first light. The Kepler early light curve is fully consistent with a single power-law rise, without evidence of any bump feature. We compare SN 2018agk with a sample of other SNe Ia without early excess flux from the literature. We find that SNe Ia without excess flux have slowly evolving early colors in a narrow range (g - i ≈ -0.20 ± 0.20 mag) within the first ~10 days. On the other hand, among SNe Ia detected with excess, SN 2017cbv and SN 2018oh tend to be bluer, while iPTF16abc's evolution is similar to normal SNe Ia without excess in g - i. We further compare the Kepler light curve of SN 2018agk with companion-interaction models, and rule out the existence of a typical nondegenerate companion undergoing Roche lobe overflow at viewing angles smaller than 45°.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923..167W,[]
Transients from the Cataclysmic Deaths of Cataclysmic Variables,"We explore the observational appearance of the merger of a low-mass star with a white dwarf (WD) binary companion. We are motivated by recent work finding that multiple tensions between the observed properties of cataclysmic variables (CVs) and standard evolution models are resolved if a large fraction of CV binaries merge as a result of unstable mass transfer. Tidal disruption of the secondary forms a geometrically thick disk around the WD, which subsequently accretes at highly super-Eddington rates. Analytic estimates and numerical hydrodynamical simulations reveal that outflows from the accretion flow unbind a large fraction ≳90% of the secondary at velocities ~500-1000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> within days of the merger. Hydrogen recombination in the expanding ejecta powers optical transient emission lasting about a month with a luminosity ≳10<SUP>38</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, similar to slow classical novae and luminous red novae from ordinary stellar mergers. Over longer timescales the mass accreted by the WD undergoes hydrogen shell burning, inflating the remnant into a giant of luminosity ~300-5000 L <SUB>⊙</SUB>, effective temperature T <SUB>eff</SUB> ≈ 3000 K, and lifetime ~10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. We predict that ~10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> Milky Way giants are CV merger products, potentially distinguishable by atypical surface abundances. We explore whether any Galactic historical slow classical novae are masquerading CV mergers by identifying four such post-nova systems with potential giant counterparts for which a CV merger origin cannot be ruled out. We address whether the historical transient CK Vul and its gaseous/dusty nebula resulted from a CV merger.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923..100M,[]
Local Environments of Low-redshift Supernovae,"We characterize the local (2 kpc sized) environments of Type Ia, II, and Ib/c supernovae (SNe) that have recently occurred in nearby (d ≲ 50 Mpc) galaxies. Using ultraviolet (UV; from Galaxy Evolution Explorer) and infrared (IR; from Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer) maps of 359 galaxies and a sample of 472 SNe, we measure the star formation rate surface density (Σ<SUB>SFR</SUB>) and stellar mass surface density (Σ<SUB>⋆</SUB>) in a 2 kpc beam centered on each SN site. We show that core-collapse SNe are preferentially located along the resolved galactic star-forming main sequence, whereas Type Ia SNe are extended to lower values of Σ<SUB>SFR</SUB> at fixed Σ<SUB>⋆</SUB>, indicative of locations inside quiescent galaxies or quiescent regions of galaxies. We also test how well the radial distribution of each SN type matches the radial distributions of UV and IR light in each host galaxy. We find that, to first order, the distributions of all types of SNe mirror those of both near-IR light (3.4 and 4.5 μm, tracing the stellar mass distribution) and mid-IR light (12 and 22 μm, tracing emission from hot, small grains), and also resemble our best-estimate Σ<SUB>SFR</SUB>. All types of SNe appear more radially concentrated than the UV emission of their host galaxies. In more detail, the distributions of Type II SNe show small statistical differences from those of near-IR light. We attribute this overall structural uniformity to the fact that within any individual galaxy, Σ<SUB>SFR</SUB> and Σ<SUB>⋆</SUB> track one another well, with variations in Σ<SUB>SFR</SUB>/Σ<SUB>⋆</SUB> most visible when comparing between galaxies.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923...86C,[]
The Remarkable Spin-down and Ultrafast Outflows of the Highly Pulsed Supersoft Source of Nova Herculis 2021,"Nova Her 2021 (V1674 Her), which erupted on 2021 June 12, reached naked-eye brightness and has been detected from radio to γ-rays. An extremely fast optical decline of 2 magnitudes in 1.2 days and strong Ne lines imply a high-mass white dwarf. The optical pre-outburst detection of a 501.42 s oscillation suggests a magnetic white dwarf. This is the first time that an oscillation of this magnitude has been detected in a classical nova prior to outburst. We report X-ray outburst observations from Swift and Chandra that uniquely show (1) a very strong modulation of supersoft X-rays at a different period from reported optical periods, (2) strong pulse profile variations and the possible presence of period variations of the order of 0.1-0.3 s, and (3) rich grating spectra that vary with modulation phase and show P Cygni-type emission lines with two dominant blueshifted absorption components at ~3000 and 9000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> indicating expansion velocities up to 11,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. X-ray oscillations most likely arise from inhomogeneous photospheric emission related to the magnetic field. Period differences between reported pre- and post-outburst optical observations, if not due to other period drift mechanisms, suggest a large ejected mass for such a fast nova, in the range 2 × 10<SUP>-5</SUP>-2 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. A difference between the period found in the Chandra data and a reported contemporaneous post-outburst optical period, as well as the presence of period drifts, could be due to weakly nonrigid photospheric rotation.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922L..42D,[]
AT 2018lqh: Black Hole Born from a Rotating Star?,"Recently an intriguing transient, AT 2018lqh, with only a day-scale duration and a high luminosity of 7 × 10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, was discovered. While several possibilities are raised on its origin, the nature of this transient is yet to be unveiled. We propose that a black hole (BH) with ~30 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> forming from a rotating blue supergiant can generate a transient like AT 2018lqh. We find that this scenario can consistently explain the optical/UV emission and the tentative late-time X-ray detection, as well as the radio upper limits. If super-Eddington accretion onto the nascent BH powers the X-ray emission, continued X-ray observations may be able to test the presence of an accretion disk around the BH.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922L..34T,[]
The Challenges Ahead for Multimessenger Analyses of Gravitational Waves and Kilonova: A Case Study on GW190425,"In recent years, there have been significant advances in multimessenger astronomy due to the discovery of the first, and so far only confirmed, gravitational wave event with a simultaneous electromagnetic (EM) counterpart, as well as improvements in numerical simulations, gravitational wave (GW) detectors, and transient astronomy. This has led to the exciting possibility of performing joint analyses of the GW and EM data, providing additional constraints on fundamental properties of the binary progenitor and merger remnant. Here, we present a new Bayesian framework that allows inference of these properties, while taking into account the systematic modeling uncertainties that arise when mapping from GW binary progenitor properties to photometric light curves. We extend the relative binning method presented in Zackay et al. to include extrinsic GW parameters for fast analysis of the GW signal. The focus of our EM framework is on light curves arising from r-process nucleosynthesis in the ejected material during and after merger, the so-called kilonova, and particularly on black hole-neutron star systems. As a case study, we examine the recent detection of GW190425, where the primary object is consistent with being either a black hole or a neutron star. We show quantitatively how improved mapping between binary progenitor and outflow properties, and/or an increase in EM data quantity and quality are required in order to break degeneracies in the fundamental source parameters.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922..269R,[]
Long-term Variability of the Composite Galaxy SDSS J103911-000057: A True Type-2 AGN Candidate,"In this manuscript, the composite galaxy SDSS J103911-000057 (=SDSS J1039) is reported as a true Type-2 AGN candidate without hidden BLRs. Only narrow emission lines, not broad, detected in SDSS J1039 can be confirmed both by the F-test technique and by the expected broad emission lines with an EW smaller than 13.5 Å with a 99% confidence level. Meanwhile, a reliable AGN power-law component is preferred with a confidence level higher than 7σ in SDSS J1039. Furthermore, the long-term variability of SDSS J1039 from Catalina Sky Survey can be described by the DRW process with an intrinsic variability timescale τ ~ 100 days, similar to normal quasars. And, based on BH mass in SDSS J1039 through the M <SUB>BH</SUB>-σ relation and on the correlation between AGN continuum luminosity and total Hα luminosity, the expected broad Hα, if there was one, could be reconstructed with a line width of about 300-1000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and with a line flux of about 666 × 10<SUP>-17</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> under the virialization assumption to BLRs, providing robust evidence to reject the probability that the intrinsic probable broad Hα was overwhelmed by noises of the SDSS spectrum in SDSS J1039. Moreover, SDSS J1039 follows the same correlation between continuum luminosity and [O III] line luminosity as the one for normal broad-line AGN, indicating SDSS J1039 classified as a changing-look AGN in the dim state can be ruled out. Therefore, under the current knowledge, SDSS J1039 is a better candidate for a true Type-2 AGN.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922..248X,[]
AT 2018lqh and the Nature of the Emerging Population of Day-scale Duration Optical Transients,"We report on the discovery of AT 2018lqh (ZTF 18abfzgpl)-a rapidly evolving extragalactic transient in a star-forming host at 242 Mpc. The transient g-band light curve's duration above a half-maximum light is about 2.1 days, where 0.4/1.7 days are spent on the rise/decay, respectively. The estimated bolometric light curve of this object peaked at about 7 × 10<SUP>42</SUP>erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>-roughly 7 times brighter than the neutron star (NS)-NS merger event AT 2017gfo. We show that this event can be explained by an explosion with a fast (v ~ 0.08 c) low-mass (≈0.07 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) ejecta, composed mostly of radioactive elements. For example, ejecta dominated by <SUP>56</SUP>Ni with a timescale of t <SUB>0</SUB> ≅ 1.6 days for the ejecta to become optically thin for γ-rays fits the data well. Such a scenario requires burning at densities that are typically found in the envelopes of neutron stars or the cores of white dwarfs. A combination of circumstellar material (CSM) interaction power at early times and shock cooling at late times is consistent with the photometric observations, but the observed spectrum of the event may pose some challenges for this scenario. We argue that the observations are not consistent with a shock breakout from a stellar envelope, while a model involving a low-mass ejecta ramming into low-mass CSM cannot explain both the early- and late-time observations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922..247O,[]
Phases of Mass Transfer from Hot Subdwarfs to White Dwarf Companions and Their Photometric Properties,"Binary systems of a hot subdwarf B (sdB) star + a white dwarf (WD) with orbital periods less than 2-3 hr can come into contact due to gravitational waves and transfer mass from the sdB star to the WD before the sdB star ceases nuclear burning and contracts to become a WD. Motivated by the growing class of observed systems in this category, we study the phases of mass transfer in these systems. We find that because the residual outer hydrogen envelope accounts for a large fraction of an sdB star's radius, sdB stars can spend a significant amount of time (~tens of megayears) transferring this small amount of material at low rates (~10<SUP>-10</SUP>-10<SUP>-9</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) before transitioning to a phase where the bulk of their He transfers at much faster rates ( ≳10<SUP>-8</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>). These systems therefore spend a surprising amount of time with Roche-filling sdB donors at orbital periods longer than the range associated with He star models without an envelope. We predict that the envelope transfer phase should be detectable by searching for ellipsoidal modulation of Roche-filling objects with P <SUB>orb</SUB> = 30-100 minutes and T <SUB>eff</SUB> = 20,000-30,000 K, and that many (≥10) such systems may be found in the Galactic plane after accounting for reddening. We also argue that many of these systems may go through a phase of He transfer that matches the signatures of AM CVn systems, and that some AM CVn systems associated with young stellar populations likely descend from this channel.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922..245B,[]
Carnegie Supernova Project: The First Homogeneous Sample of Super-Chandrasekhar-mass/2003fg-like Type Ia Supernovae,"We present a multiwavelength photometric and spectroscopic analysis of 13 super-Chandrasekhar-mass/2003fg-like Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Nine of these objects were observed by the Carnegie Supernova Project. The 2003fg-like SNe have slowly declining light curves (Δm <SUB>15</SUB>(B) < 1.3 mag), and peak absolute B-band magnitudes of -19 < M <SUB> B </SUB> < -21 mag. Many of the 2003fg-like SNe are located in the same part of the luminosity-width relation as normal SNe Ia. In the optical B and V bands, the 2003fg-like SNe look like normal SNe Ia, but at redder wavelengths they diverge. Unlike other luminous SNe Ia, the 2003fg-like SNe generally have only one i-band maximum, which peaks after the epoch of the B-band maximum, while their near-IR (NIR) light-curve rise times can be ≳40 days longer than those of normal SNe Ia. They are also at least 1 mag brighter in the NIR bands than normal SNe Ia, peaking above M <SUB> H </SUB> = -19 mag, and generally have negative Hubble residuals, which may be the cause of some systematics in dark-energy experiments. Spectroscopically, the 2003fg-like SNe exhibit peculiarities such as unburnt carbon well past maximum light, a large spread (8000-12,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) in Si II λ6355 velocities at maximum light with no rapid early velocity decline, and no clear H-band break at +10 days. We find that SNe with a larger pseudo-equivalent width of C II at maximum light have lower Si II λ6355 velocities and more slowly declining light curves. There are also multiple factors that contribute to the peak luminosity of 2003fg-like SNe. The explosion of a C-O degenerate core inside a carbon-rich envelope is consistent with these observations. Such a configuration may come from the core-degenerate scenario.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922..205A,[]
Are Stripped Envelope Supernovae Really Deficient in <SUP>56</SUP>Ni?,"Recent works have indicated that the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni masses estimated for stripped envelope supernovae (SESNe) are systematically higher than those estimated for SNe II. Although this may suggest a distinct progenitor structure between these types of SNe, the possibility remains that this may be caused by observational bias. One important possible bias is that SESNe with low <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass are dim, and therefore more likely to escape detection. By investigating the distributions of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass and distance of the samples collected from the literature, we find that the current literature SESN sample indeed suffers from a significant observational bias, i.e., objects with low <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass-if they exist-will be missed, especially at larger distances. Note, however, that those distant objects in our sample are mostly SNe Ic-BL. We also conducted mock observations assuming that the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass distribution for SESNe is intrinsically the same as that of SNe II. We find that the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass distribution of the detected SESN samples moves toward higher mass than the assumed intrinsic distribution because of the difficulty in detecting the low-<SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass SESNe. These results could explain the general trend of the higher <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass distribution (than SNe II) of SESNe found thus far in the literature. However, further finding clear examples of low-<SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass SESNe (≤ 0.01 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) is required to strengthen this hypothesis. Also, objects with high <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass (≳ 0.2 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) are not explained by our model, which may require an additional explanation.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922..141O,[]
Mysterious Dust-emitting Object Orbiting TIC 400799224,"We report the discovery of a unique object of uncertain nature-but quite possibly a disintegrating asteroid or minor planet-orbiting one star of the widely separated binary TIC 400799224. We initially identified the system in data from TESS Sector 10 via an abnormally shaped fading event in the light curve (hereafter ""dips""). Follow-up speckle imaging determined that TIC 400799224 is actually two stars of similar brightness at 0.″62 separation, forming a likely bound binary with projected separation of ~300 au. We cannot yet determine which star in the binary is host to the dips in flux. ASAS-SN and Evryscope archival data show that there is a strong periodicity of the dips at ~19.77 days, leading us to believe that an occulting object is orbiting the host star, though the duration, depth, and shape of the dips vary substantially. Statistical analysis of the ASAS-SN data shows that the dips only occur sporadically at a detectable threshold in approximately one out of every three to five transits, lending credence to the possibility that the occulter is a sporadically emitted dust cloud. The cloud is also fairly optically thick, blocking up to 37% or 75% of the light from the host star, depending on the true host. Further observations may allow for greater detail to be gleaned as to the origin and composition of the occulter, as well as to a determination of which of the two stars comprising TIC 400799224 is the true host star of the dips.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..299P,[]
Gemini/GMOS Transmission Spectroscopy of the Grazing Planet Candidate WD 1856+534 b,"WD 1856+534 b is a Jupiter-sized, cool giant planet candidate transiting the white dwarf WD 1856+534. Here, we report an optical transmission spectrum of WD 1856+534 b obtained from ten transits using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph. This system is challenging to observe due to the faintness of the host star and the short transit duration. Nevertheless, our phase-folded white light curve reached a precision of 0.12%. WD 1856+534 b provides a unique transit configuration compared to other known exoplanets: the planet is 8× larger than its star and occults over half of the stellar disk during mid-transit. Consequently, many standard modeling assumptions do not hold. We introduce the concept of a ""limb darkening corrected, time-averaged transmission spectrum"" and propose that this is more suitable than ${({R}_{p,\lambda }/{R}_{s})}^{2}$ for comparisons to atmospheric models for planets with grazing transits. We also present a modified radiative transfer prescription. Though the transmission spectrum shows no prominent absorption features, it is sufficiently precise to constrain the mass of WD 1856+534 b to be >0.84 M <SUB> J </SUB> (to 2σ confidence), assuming a clear atmosphere and a Jovian composition. High-altitude cloud decks can allow lower masses. WD 1856+534 b could have formed either as a result of common envelope evolution or migration under the Kozai-Lidov mechanism. Further studies of WD 1856+534 b, alongside new dedicated searches for substellar objects around white dwarfs, will shed further light on the mysteries of post-main-sequence planetary systems.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..296X,[]
Prospects for Detecting Exoplanets around Double White Dwarfs with LISA and Taiji,"Recently, Tamanini & Danielski discussed the possibility of detecting circumbinary exoplanets (CBPs) orbiting double white dwarfs (DWDs) with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Extending their methods and criteria, we discuss the prospects for detecting exoplanets around DWDs not only by LISA, but also by Taiji, a Chinese space-borne gravitational-wave (GW) mission that has slightly better sensitivity at low frequencies. We first explore how different binary masses and mass ratios affect the abilities of LISA and Taiji to detect CBPs. Second, for certain known detached DWDs with high signal-to-noise ratios, we quantify the possibility of CBP detections around them. Third, based on the DWD population obtained from the Mock LISA Data Challenge, we present basic assessments of the CBP detections in our Galaxy during a 4 yr mission time for LISA and Taiji. We discuss the constraints on the detectable zone of each system, as well as the distributions of the inner/outer edge of the detectable zone. With the DWD population, we further inject two different planet distributions with an occurrence rate of 50% and constrain the total detection rates. We briefly discuss the prospects for detecting habitable CBPs around DWDs with a simplified model. These results can provide helpful inputs for upcoming exoplanetary projects and help analyze planetary systems after the common envelope phase.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..247K,[]
Exploring the Solar System with the NOIRLab Source Catalog I: Detecting Objects with CANFind,"Despite extensive searches and the relative proximity of solar system objects (SSOs) to Earth, many remain undiscovered and there is still much to learn about their properties and interactions. This work is the first in a series dedicated to detecting and analyzing SSOs in the all-sky NOIRLab Source Catalog (NSC). We search the first data release of the NSC with CANFind, a Computationally Automated NSC tracklet Finder. NSC DR1 contains 34 billion measurements of 2.9 billion unique objects, which CANFind categorizes as belonging to ""stationary"" (distant stars, galaxies) or moving (SSOs) objects via an iterative clustering method. Detections of stationary bodies for proper-motion μ ≤ 2.″5 hr<SUP>-1</SUP> (0.°017 day<SUP>-1</SUP>) are identified and analyzed separately. Remaining detections belonging to high-μ objects are clustered together over single nights to form ""tracklets."" Each tracklet contains detections of an individual moving object, and is validated based on spatial linearity and motion through time. Proper motions are then calculated and used to connect tracklets and other unassociated measurements over multiple nights by predicting their locations at common times, forming ""tracks."" This method extracted 527,055 tracklets from NSC DR1 in an area covering 29,971 square degrees of the sky. The data show distinct groups of objects with similar observed μ in ecliptic coordinates, namely Main Belt Asteroids, Jupiter Trojans, and Kuiper Belt Objects. Apparent magnitudes range from 10 to 25 mag in the ugrizY and VR bands. Color-color diagrams show a bimodality of tracklets between primarily carbonaceous and siliceous groups, supporting prior studies.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..244F,[]
Alert Classification for the ALeRCE Broker System: The Real-time Stamp Classifier,"We present a real-time stamp classifier of astronomical events for the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events broker, ALeRCE. The classifier is based on a convolutional neural network, trained on alerts ingested from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Using only the science, reference, and difference images of the first detection as inputs, along with the metadata of the alert as features, the classifier is able to correctly classify alerts from active galactic nuclei, supernovae (SNe), variable stars, asteroids, and bogus classes, with high accuracy (~94%) in a balanced test set. In order to find and analyze SN candidates selected by our classifier from the ZTF alert stream, we designed and deployed a visualization tool called SN Hunter, where relevant information about each possible SN is displayed for the experts to choose among candidates to report to the Transient Name Server database. From 2019 June 26 to 2021 February 28, we have reported 6846 SN candidates to date (11.8 candidates per day on average), of which 971 have been confirmed spectroscopically. Our ability to report objects using only a single detection means that 70% of the reported SNe occurred within one day after the first detection. ALeRCE has only reported candidates not otherwise detected or selected by other groups, therefore adding new early transients to the bulk of objects available for early follow-up. Our work represents an important milestone toward rapid alert classifications with the next generation of large etendue telescopes, such as the Vera C.

A buyer's guide to the Hubble constant,"Since the expansion of the universe was first established by Edwin Hubble and Georges Lemaître about a century ago, the Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB> which measures its rate has been of great interest to astronomers. Besides being interesting in its own right, few properties of the universe can be deduced without it.

Star formation and nuclear activity in luminous infrared galaxies: an infrared through radio review,"Nearby galaxies offer unique laboratories allowing multi-wavelength spatially resolved studies of the interstellar medium, star formation and nuclear activity across a broad range of physical conditions. In particular, detailed studies of individual local luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) are crucial for gaining a better understanding of these processes and for developing and testing models that are used to explain statistical studies of large populations of such galaxies at high redshift for which it is currently impossible to reach a sufficient physical resolution. Here, we provide an overview of the impact of spatially resolved infrared, sub-millimetre and radio observations in the study of the interstellar medium, star formation and active galactic nuclei as well as their interplay in local LIRGs. We also present an overview of the modelling of their spectral energy distributions using state-of-the-art radiative transfer codes. These contribute necessary and powerful `workhorse' tools for the study of LIRGs (and their more luminous counterparts) at higher redshifts which are unresolved in observations. We describe how spatially-resolved time-domain observations have recently opened a new window to study the nuclear activity in LIRGs. We describe in detail the observational characteristics of Arp 299 which is one of the best studied local LIRGs and exemplifies the power of the combination of time-domain and high-resolution observations at infrared to radio wavelengths together with radiative transfer modelling used to explain the spectral energy distributions of its different components. We summarise the previous achievements obtained using high-spatial resolution observations and provide an outlook into what we can expect to achieve with future facilities.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&ARv..29....2P,[]
SRG X-ray orbital observatory. Its telescopes and first scientific results,"The orbital observatory Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG), equipped with the grazing-incidence X-ray telescopes Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC and eROSITA, was launched by Roscosmos to the Lagrange L2 point of the Sun-Earth system on July 13, 2019. The launch was carried out from the Baikonur Cosmodrome by a Proton-M rocket with a DM-03 upper stage. The German telescope eROSITA was installed on SRG under an agreement between Roskosmos and the DLR, the German Aerospace Agency. In December 2019, SRG started to perform its main scientific task: scanning the celestial sphere to obtain X-ray maps of the entire sky in several energy ranges (from 0.2 to 8 keV with eROSITA, and from 4 to 30 keV with ART-XC). By mid-June 2021, the third six-month all-sky survey had been completed. Over a period of four years, it is planned to obtain eight independent maps of the entire sky in each of the energy ranges. The sum of these maps will provide high sensitivity and reveal more than three million quasars and over one hundred thousand massive galaxy clusters and galaxy groups. The availability of eight sky maps will enable monitoring of long-term variability (every six months) of a huge number of extragalactic and Galactic X-ray sources, including hundreds of thousands of stars with hot coronae. In addition, the rotation of the satellite around the axis directed toward the Sun with a period of four hours enables tracking the faster variability of bright X-ray sources during one day every half year. The chosen strategy of scanning the sky leads to the formation of deep survey zones near both ecliptic poles. The paper presents sky maps obtained by the telescopes on board SRG during the first survey of the entire sky and a number of results of deep observations performed during the flight to the L2 point in the frame of the performance verification program, demonstrating the capabilities of the observatory in imaging, spectroscopy, and timing of X-ray sources. It is planned that in December 2023, the observatory will for at least two years switch to observations of the most interesting sources in the sky in triaxial orientation mode and deep scanning of selected celestial fields with an area of up to 150 square degrees. These modes of operation were tested during the performance verification phase. Every day, data from the SRG observatory are dumped onto the largest antennas of the Russian Deep Space Network in Bear Lakes and near Ussuriysk.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...656A.132S,[]

All light curves were inspected in detail to select the most promising candidates. Where available, low-resolution spectra from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) were employed to classify the stars on the MK system and confirm their status as mCP stars.",,,[]
"Results: We have identified 86 new promising ACV star candidates. Fifteen of these stars have LAMOST spectra available that, in all cases, confirm them as classical mCP stars, which highlights the viability of our approach. We present astrophysical parameters for all sample stars that can be sorted into four subgroups characterized by distinct light curve shapes. Anti-phase variations in different photometric passbands, in particular, are a unique characteristic of a subset of ACV stars readily usable for their identification. The availability of data in three different passbands (g, r, and i) is a major advantage of the ZTF survey.",,,[]
"Conclusions: On the basis of our experience with other photometric surveys and the analysis of light curves, we conclude that the ZTF is well suited to the search for, and the analysis of, ACV variables that are not considered in the available ZTF variable star catalogs. Further work will focus on the development and refinement of a search algorithm to correctly identify these stars in ZTF data and, subsequently, in massive photometric time series databases in general.",,,[]

Mass limits of the extremely fast-spinning white dwarf CTCV J2056-3014,"CTCV J2056-3014 is a nearby cataclysmic variable with an orbital period of approximately 1.76 h at a distance of about 853 light-years from the Earth. Its recently reported X-ray properties suggest that J2056-3014 is an unusual accretion-powered intermediate polar that harbors a fast-spinning white dwarf (WD) with a spin period of 29.6 s. The low X-ray luminosity and the relatively modest accretion rate per unit area suggest that the shock is not occurring near the WD surface. It has been argued that, under these conditions, the maximum temperature of the shock cannot be directly used to determine the mass of the WD (which, under the abovementioned assumptions, would be around 0.46 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). Here, we explore the stability of this rapidly rotating WD using a modern equation of state (EoS) that accounts for electron-ion, electron-electron, and ion-ion interactions. For this EoS, we determine the mass density thresholds for the onset of pycnonuclear fusion reactions and study the impact of microscopic stability and rapid rotation on the structure and stability of WDs, considering them with helium, carbon, oxygen, and neon. From this analysis, we obtain a minimum mass for CTCV J2056-3014 of 0.56 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a maximum mass of around 1.38 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. If the mass of CTCV J2056-3014 is close to the lower mass limit, its equatorial radius would be on the order of 10<SUP>4</SUP> km due to rapid rotation. Such a radius is significantly larger than that of a nonrotating WD of average mass (0.6 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), which is on the order of 7 × 10<SUP>3</SUP> km. The effects on the minimum mass of J2056-3014 due to changes in the temperature and composition of the stellar matter were found to be negligibly small.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...656A..77O,[]
Different to the core: The pre-supernova structures of massive single and binary-stripped stars,"The majority of massive stars live in binary or multiple systems and will interact with a companion during their lifetimes, which helps to explain the observed diversity of core-collapse supernovae. Donor stars in binary systems can lose most of their hydrogen-rich envelopes through mass transfer. As a result, not only are the surface properties affected, but so is the core structure. However, most calculations of the core-collapse properties of massive stars rely on single-star models. We present a systematic study of the difference between the pre-supernova structures of single stars and stars of the same initial mass (11-21 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) that have been stripped due to stable post-main-sequence mass transfer at solar metallicity. We present the pre-supernova core composition with novel diagrams that give an intuitive representation of the isotope distribution. As shown in previous studies, at the edge of the carbon-oxygen core, the binary-stripped star models contain an extended gradient of carbon, oxygen, and neon. This layer remains until core collapse and is more extended in mass for higher initial stellar masses. It originates from the receding of the convective helium core during core helium burning in binary-stripped stars, which does not occur in single-star models. We find that this same evolutionary phase leads to systematic differences in the final density and nuclear energy generation profiles. Binary-stripped star models have systematically higher total masses of carbon at the moment of core collapse compared to single-star models, which likely results in systematically different supernova yields. In about half of our models, the silicon-burning and oxygen-rich layers merge after core silicon burning. We discuss the implications of our findings for the ""explodability"", supernova observations, and nucleosynthesis of these stars. Our models are publicly available and can be readily used as input for detailed supernova simulations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...656A..58L,[]
Contribution of flares from tidal disruptions of stars to high-redshift AGN,"We explore the contribution of tidal disruption events (TDEs) to the flares in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at high redshifts. Using the latest data available from X-ray and optical observations of high-redshift galaxies, in combination with the evolution of their central supermassive black holes, we calculate the contribution of TDE to AGNs as a function of their luminosities. We find that at low redshifts (z < 1), a few percent of all AGN with bolometric luminosities L<SUB>Bol</SUB> ≲ 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>−1</SUP> may be attributable to possible TDEs. However, this fraction can significantly increase at earlier cosmic times, including up to several tens of percent of the population of AGN at z ≳ 3. TDEs may comprise a significant fraction of the Compton-Thick AGN population at z ≳ 3. The above findings motivate further calibrations with upcoming X-ray missions and spectroscopic surveys targeting TDE-AGN.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...656A..47P,[]
Variable stars in the 50BiN open cluster survey. II. NGC 869,"This work presents a time-series photometric variability survey of the young open cluster NGC 869. More than 13 000 CCD frames in the BV filters were collected on 19 nights between 2014 November 6 and 2014 December 24. In a 20' × 20' field centered on the cluster, we detected a total of 28 stars showing photometric variability, 12 of which are new discoveries. The classifications and memberships of the variable stars are discussed according to the behaviors and periods of the light curves as well as their positions on the H-R diagram. These results conclude that 22 variable stars are probable members of the cluster while six other stars belong to the field star population. They are categorized as 18 pulsating variable stars (four β Cep, seven SPB, one β Cep / SPB, four Be stars, and two δ Sct / γ Dor candidates), seven eclipsing binaries (five EA and two EB) and three unknown type stars.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021RAA....21..227Z,[]
Searching for axionlike particles from core-collapse supernovae with Fermi LAT's low-energy technique,"Light axionlike particles (ALPs) are expected to be abundantly produced in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), resulting in a ∼10 -second long burst of ALPs. These particles subsequently undergo conversion into gamma rays in external magnetic fields to produce a long gamma-ray burst (GRB) with a characteristic spectrum peaking in the 30-100-MeV energy range. At the same time, CCSNe are invoked as progenitors of ordinary long GRBs, rendering it relevant to conduct a comprehensive search for ALP spectral signatures using the observations of long GRBs with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). We perform a data-driven sensitivity analysis to determine CCSN distances for which a detection of an ALP signal is possible with the LAT's low-energy technique which, in contrast to the standard LAT analysis, allows for a a larger effective area for energies down to 30 MeV. Assuming an ALP mass m<SUB>a</SUB>≲10<SUP>-10</SUP> eV and ALP-photon coupling g<SUB>a γ</SUB>=5.3 ×10<SUP>-12</SUP> GeV<SUP>-1</SUP> , values considered and deduced in ALP searches from SN1987A, we find that the distance limit ranges from ∼0.5 to ∼10 Mpc , depending on the sky location and the CCSN progenitor mass. Furthermore, we select a candidate sample of 24 GRBs and carry out a model comparison analysis in which we consider different GRB spectral models with and without an ALP signal component. We find that the inclusion of an ALP contribution does not result in any statistically significant improvement of the fits to the data. We discuss the statistical method used in our analysis and the underlying physical assumptions, the feasibility of setting upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling, and give an outlook on future telescopes in the context of ALP searches.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PhRvD.104j3001C,[]
A colour portrait of the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov,"The aim of this paper is to report on the results of a multicolour observing campaign performed at the LBT on the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov during three epochs while target was approaching its perihelion: UBVRI images have been observed in October and December 2019, when the comet was at ∼2.3 and 2.0 au from the Sun, respectively. Comet Borisov presented a rather complex morphology, especially in the December observing epoch, when a bi-lobate structure on a global scale was visible, with a jet-like structure characterised by a disconnection event, probably due to the presence of an active area on the nucleus' surface combined with its rotational properties. U - B colour, measured for the first time for this comet, monotonically decreases as Borisov approaches perihelion, from 0.35 ± 0.05 in October 19th to -0.07 ± 0.05 in December 2nd; B - V colour shows a more chaotic behaviour, with values for October epochs quite similar to solar colours, and a higher value of 0.76 ± 0.04 in December 2nd, probably due to a combination of an increase of the B flux (CN emission) and of an increase in V flux (due to C<SUB>2</SUB>). V - R and R-I colours derived in both the October and December observing epochs depict a scenario of a coma slightly redder than the Sun, with a RI-reddening value of ∼11%/1000 Å and ∼5%/1000 Å, respectively. The R- Afρ at the reference aperture of r ∼10<SUP>4</SUP> km from the optocentre slightly decreases from ∼100 cm (October) to ∼ 70 cm (December), showing that the Borisov's dust environment is quite similar to those of Short Period Comets of our Solar System.

Application of the principal components analysis technique to optical fiber sensors for acetone detection,"Generally, the data analysis of sensors based on spectral measurements, for instance, fiber Bragg gratings (FBG), long period fiber gratings (LPFG) is performed observing the shift or attenuation of a single wavelength. However, sometimes such spectrum variations are not evident or clearly perceptible; therefore, it becomes necessary to use other analysis techniques. One of them is principal components analysis (PCA) which allows to explore the behavior of the complete transmission spectrum pattern. In this work, we show the application of PCA to the response of fiber optical sensors for acetone detection. Two kinds of acetone sensors based upon single long period fiber gratings (LPFG) and Mach-Zehnder fiber interferometers (MZI), formed with a pair of cascaded LPFGs, coated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) were developed. The sensor response was measured inside a Teflon chamber injecting a liquid acetone sample. The transmission spectrum variations at the devices output were measured with an optical spectrum analyzer, stored in a computer and analyzed by PCA. A comparison between the performance of both kinds of sensors was carried out and it was found that the sensitivity was increased up to 13 times (from 0.7 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> ppm<SUP>-1</SUP> to 9.4 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> ppm<SUP>-1</SUP>) for the MZI sensors compared with that of single LPFG ones, which means, at best, a limit of detection (LOD) of 170 ppm.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021OptLT.14307314R,[]
Ultra Fast Astronomy: Optimized Detection of Multimessenger Transients,"Ultra Fast Astronomy is a new frontier becoming enabled by improved detector technology allowing discovery of optical transients on millisecond to nanosecond time scales. These may reveal counterparts of energetic processes such as fast radio bursts, gamma ray bursts, gravitational wave events, or play a role in the optical search for extraterrestrial intelligence (oSETI). We explore some example science cases and their optimization under constrained resources, basically how to distribute observations along the spectrum of short duration searches of many targets or long searches over fewer targets. As a demonstration of the method we present some analytic and some numerical optimizations, of both raw detections and science characterization such as an information matrix analysis of constraining a burst delay - flash duration relation.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021OJAp....4E..14D,[]
Spectral separation of the stochastic gravitational-wave background for LISA in the context of a modulated Galactic foreground,"Within its observational band the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, LISA, will simultaneously observe orbital modulated waveforms from Galactic white dwarf binaries, a binary black hole produced gravitational-wave background, and potentially a cosmologically created stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB). The overwhelming majority of stars end their lives as white dwarfs, making them very numerous in the Milky Way. We simulate Galactic white dwarf binary gravitational-wave emission based on distributions from various mock catalogues and determine a complex waveform from the Galactic foreground with 3.5 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> binaries. We describe the effects from the Galactic binary distribution population across mass, position within the Galaxy, core type, and orbital frequency distribution. We generate the modulated Galactic white dwarf signal detected by LISA due to its orbital motion, and present a data analysis strategy to address it. The Fisher Information and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods give an estimation of the LISA noise and the parameters for the different signal classes. We estimate the detectable limits for the future LISA observation of the SGWB in the spectral domain with the three LISA channels A, E, and T. We simultaneously estimate the Galactic foreground, the astrophysical and cosmological backgrounds. Assuming the expected astrophysical background and a Galactic foreground, a cosmological background energy density of around Ω<SUB>GW,cosmo</SUB> ≈ 8 × 10<SUP>-13</SUP> could be detected by LISA. LISA will either detect a cosmologically produced SGWB, or set a limit that will have important consequences.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.508..803B,[]

Searching for Fermi GRB optical counterparts with the prototype Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO),"The typical detection rate of ~1 gamma-ray burst (GRB) per day by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) provides a valuable opportunity to further our understanding of GRB physics. However, the large uncertainty of the Fermi localization typically prevents rapid identification of multiwavelength counterparts. We report the follow-up of 93 Fermi GRBs with the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) prototype on La Palma. We selected 53 events (based on favourable observing conditions) for detailed analysis, and to demonstrate our strategy of searching for optical counterparts. We apply a filtering process consisting of both automated and manual steps to 60 085 candidates initially, rejecting all but 29, arising from 15 events. With ≈3 GRB afterglows expected to be detectable with GOTO from our sample, most of the candidates are unlikely to be related to the GRBs. Since we did not have multiple observations for those candidates, we cannot confidently confirm the association between the transients and the GRBs. Our results show that GOTO can effectively search for GRB optical counterparts thanks to its large field of view of ≈40 deg<SUP>2</SUP> and its depth of ≈20 mag. We also detail several methods to improve our overall performance for future follow-up programmes of Fermi GRBs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507.5463M,[]
Deep co-added sky from Catalina Sky Survey images,"A number of synoptic sky surveys are underway or being planned. Typically, they are done with small telescopes and relatively short exposure times. A search for transient or variable sources involves comparison with deeper baseline images, ideally obtained through the same telescope and camera. With that in mind, we have stacked images from the 0.68 m Schmidt telescope on Mt. Bigelow taken over 10 yr as part of the Catalina Sky Survey. In order to generate deep reference images for the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS), close to 0.8 million images over 8000 fields and covering over 27 000 sq. deg have gone into the deep stack that goes up to 3 mag deeper than individual images. CRTS system does not use a filter in imaging; hence, there is no standard passband in which the optical magnitude is measured. We estimate depth by comparing these wide-band unfiltered co-added images with images in the g band and find that the image depth ranges from 22.0 to 24.2 across the sky, with a 200-image stack attaining an equivalent AB magnitude sensitivity of 22.8. We compared various state-of-the-art software packages for co-adding astronomical images and have used SWARP for the stacking. We describe here the details of the process adopted. This methodology may be useful in other panoramic imaging applications, and to other surveys as well. The stacked images are available through a server at Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507.4983S,[]
Very Large Array imaging rules out precessing radio jets in three DES-SDSS-selected candidate periodic quasars,"Periodic quasars have been suggested as candidates for hosting binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs), although alternative scenarios remain possible to explain the optical light-curve periodicity. To test the alternative hypothesis of precessing radio jet, we present deep 6 GHz radio imaging conducted with NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in its C configuration for the three candidate periodic quasars, DES J024703.24-010032.0, DES J024944.66-000036.8, and DES J025214.67-002813.7. Our targets were selected based on their optical variability using 20 yr long multicolour light curves from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The new VLA observations show that all three periodic quasars are radio-quiet with the radio loudness parameters measured to be $R\equiv f_{6\, {\rm cm}}/f_{{\rm 2500}}$ of ≲1.0-1.5 and the k-corrected luminosities νL<SUB>ν</SUB>[6 GHz] of ≲5-21 × 10<SUP>39</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. They are in stark contrast to previously known periodic quasars proposed as binary SMBH candidates such as the blazar OJ 287 and PG1302-102. Our results rule out optical emission contributed from precessing radio jets as the origin of the optical periodicity in the three DES-SDSS-selected candidate periodic quasars. Future continued optical monitoring and complementary multiwavelength observations are still needed to further test the binary SMBH hypothesis as well as other competing scenarios to explain the optical periodicity.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507.4638C,[]
An instantaneous metal organic framework to prepare ultra-high pore volume porous carbon for lithium ion capacitors,"The wide application of lithium ion capacitors (LICs) is now seriously limited by the complex synthesis process of cathode carbon with a demand for high capacity. In this study, a metal organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived porous carbon with super large porous volume (3.504 cm<SUP>3</SUP> g<SUP>-1</SUP>) and specific surface area (3132 m<SUP>2</SUP> g<SUP>-1</SUP>) is obtained by carbonization at a reasonable temperature and acid pickling.

Physical Characterization of Main-belt Comet (248370) 2005 QN<SUB>173</SUB>,"We report results from new and archival observations of the newly discovered active asteroid (248370) 2005 QN<SUB>173</SUB> (also now designated Comet 433P), which has been determined to be a likely main-belt comet based on a subsequent discovery that it is recurrently active near perihelion. From archival data analysis, we estimate $g^{\prime} $ -, $r^{\prime} $ -, $i^{\prime} $ -, and $z^{\prime} $ -band absolute magnitudes for the nucleus of H<SUB>g</SUB> = 16.62 ± 0.13, H<SUB>r</SUB> = 16.12 ± 0.10, H<SUB>i</SUB> = 16.05 ± 0.11, and H<SUB>z</SUB> = 15.93 ± 0.08, corresponding to nucleus colors of $g^{\prime} -r^{\prime} =0.50\pm 0.16$ , $r^{\prime} -i^{\prime} =0.07\pm 0.15$ , and $i^{\prime} -z^{\prime} =0.12\pm 0.14$ ; an equivalent V-band absolute magnitude of H<SUB>V</SUB> = 16.32 ± 0.08; and a nucleus radius of r<SUB>n</SUB> = 1.6 ± 0.2 km (using a V-band albedo of p<SUB>V</SUB> = 0.054 ± 0.012). Meanwhile, we find mean near-nucleus coma colors when 248370 is active of $g^{\prime} -r^{\prime} =0.47\pm 0.03$ , $r^{\prime} -i^{\prime} =0.10\pm 0.04$ , and $i^{\prime} -z^{\prime} =0.05\pm 0.05$ and similar mean dust tail colors, suggesting that no significant gas coma is present. We find approximate ratios between the scattering cross sections of near-nucleus dust (within 5000 km of the nucleus) and the nucleus of A<SUB>d</SUB>/A<SUB>n</SUB> = 0.7 ± 0.3 on 2016 July 22 and 1.8 < A<SUB>d</SUB>/A<SUB>n</SUB> < 2.9 in 2021 July and August. During the 2021 observation period, the coma declined in intrinsic brightness by ~0.35 mag (or ~25%) in 37 days, while the surface brightness of the dust tail remained effectively constant over the same period. Constraints derived from the sunward extent of the coma and width of the tail as measured perpendicular to the orbit plane suggest that the terminal velocities of ejected dust grains are extremely slow (~1 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> for 1 μm particles), suggesting that the observed dust emission may be aided by rapid rotation of the nucleus lowering the effective escape velocity.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922L...9H,[]
Recurrent Activity from Active Asteroid (248370) 2005 QN<SUB>173</SUB>: A Main-belt Comet,"We present archival observations of main-belt asteroid (248370) 2005 QN<SUB>173</SUB> (also designated 433P) that demonstrate this recently discovered active asteroid (a body with a dynamically asteroidal orbit displaying a tail or coma) has had at least one additional apparition of activity near perihelion during a prior orbit. We discovered evidence of this second activity epoch in an image captured 2016 July 22 with the DECam on the 4 m Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. As of this writing, (248370) 2005 QN<SUB>173</SUB> is just the eighth active asteroid demonstrated to undergo recurrent activity near perihelion. Our analyses demonstrate (248370) 2005 QN<SUB>173</SUB> is likely a member of the active asteroid subset known as main-belt comets, a group of objects that orbit in the main asteroid belt that exhibit activity that is specifically driven by sublimation. We implement an activity detection technique, wedge photometry, that has the potential to detect tails in images of solar system objects and quantify their agreement with computed antisolar and antimotion vectors normally associated with observed tail directions. We present a catalog and an image gallery of archival observations. The object will soon become unobservable as it passes behind the Sun as seen from Earth, and when it again becomes visible (late 2022) it will be farther than 3 au from the Sun. Our findings suggest (248370) 2005 QN<SUB>173</SUB> is most active interior to 2.7 au (0.3 au from perihelion), so we encourage the community to observe and study this special object before 2021 December.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922L...8C,[]
Unexpected Short-period Variability in Dwarf Carbon Stars from the Zwicky Transient Facility,"Dwarf carbon (dC) stars, main-sequence stars showing carbon molecular bands, are enriched by mass transfer from a previous asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) companion, which has since evolved to a white dwarf. While previous studies have found radial-velocity variations for large samples of dCs, there are still relatively few dC orbital periods in the literature and no dC eclipsing binaries have yet been found. Here, we analyze photometric light curves from DR5 of the Zwicky Transient Facility for a sample of 944 dC stars. From these light curves, we identify 34 periodically variable dC stars. Remarkably, of the periodic dCs, 82% have periods less than two days. We also provide spectroscopic follow-up for four of these periodic systems, measuring radial velocity variations in three of them. Short-period dCs are almost certainly post-common-envelope binary systems, because the periodicity is most likely related to the orbital period, with tidally locked rotation and photometric modulation on the dC either from spots or from ellipsoidal variations. We discuss evolutionary scenarios that these binaries may have taken to accrete sufficient C-rich material while avoiding truncation of the thermally pulsing AGB phase needed to provide such material in the first place. We compare these dCs to common-envelope models to show that dC stars probably cannot accrete enough C-rich material during the common-envelope phase, suggesting another mechanism like wind-Roche lobe overflow is necessary. The periodic dCs in this paper represent a prime sample for spectroscopic follow-up and for comparison to future models of wind-Roche lobe overflow mass transfer.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922...33R,[]
Circumstellar Medium Constraints on the Environment of Two Nearby Type Ia Supernovae: SN 2017cbv and SN 2020nlb,"We present deep Chandra X-ray observations of two nearby Type Ia supernovae, SN 2017cbv and SN 2020nlb, which reveal no X-ray emission down to a luminosity L<SUB>X</SUB> ≲ 5.3 × 10<SUP>37</SUP> and ≲ 5.4 × 10<SUP>37</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> (0.3-10 keV), respectively, at ~16-18 days after the explosion. With these limits, we constrain the pre-explosion mass-loss rate of the progenitor system to be $\dot{M}$ < 7.2 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP> and < 9.7 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for each (at a wind velocity v<SUB>w</SUB> = 100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and a radius of R ≈ 10<SUP>16</SUP> cm), assuming any X-ray emission would originate from inverse Compton emission from optical photons upscattered by the supernova shock. If the supernova environment was a constant-density medium, we would find a number density limit of n<SUB>CSM</SUB> < 36 and < 65 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, respectively. These X-ray limits rule out all plausible symbiotic progenitor systems, as well as large swathes of parameter space associated with the single degenerate scenario, such as mass loss at the outer Lagrange point and accretion winds. We also present late-time optical spectroscopy of SN 2020nlb, and set strong limits on any swept up hydrogen (L<SUB>Hα</SUB> < 2.7 × 10<SUP>37</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) and helium (L<SUB>He,λ6678</SUB> < 2.7 × 10<SUP>37</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) from a nondegenerate companion, corresponding to M<SUB>H</SUB> ≲ 0.7-2 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and M<SUB>He</SUB> ≲ 4 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Radio observations of SN 2020nlb at 14.6 days after explosion also yield a non-detection, ruling out most plausible symbiotic progenitor systems.

Discovery of a 310 Day Period from the Enshrouded Massive System NaSt1 (WR 122),"We present optical and infrared (IR) light curves of NaSt1, also known as Wolf-Rayet 122, with observations from Palomar Gattini-IR (PGIR), the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, and the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). We identify a P = 309.7 ± 0.7 day photometric period from the optical and IR light curves that reveal periodic, sinusoidal variability between 2014 July and 2021 July. We also present historical IR light curves taken between 1983 July and 1989 May, which show variability consistent with the period of the present-day light curves. In the past, NaSt1 was brighter in the J band with larger variability amplitudes than the present-day PGIR values, suggesting that NaSt1 exhibits variability on longer (≳decade) timescales. Sinusoidal fits to the recent optical and IR light curves show that the amplitude of NaSt1's variability differs at various wavelengths and also reveal significant phase offsets of 17.0 ± 2.5 day between the ZTF r and PGIR J light curves. We interpret the 310 day photometric period from NaSt1 as the orbital period of an enshrouded massive binary. We suggest that the photometric variability of NaSt1 may arise from variations in the line-of-sight optical depth toward circumstellar optical/IR-emitting regions throughout its orbit due to colliding-wind dust formation. We speculate that past mass transfer in NaSt1 may have been triggered by Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) during an eruptive phase of an Ofpe/WN9 star. Lastly, we argue that NaSt1 is no longer undergoing RLOF mass transfer.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922....5L,[]
Faintest of Them All: ZTF 21aaoryiz/SN 2021fcg-Discovery of an Extremely Low Luminosity Type Iax Supernova,"We present the discovery of ZTF 21aaoryiz/SN 2021fcg-an extremely low luminosity Type Iax supernova. SN 2021fcg was discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility in the star-forming galaxy IC0512 at a distance of ≈27 Mpc. It reached a peak absolute magnitude of M<SUB>r</SUB> = -12.66 ± 0.20 mag, making it the least luminous thermonuclear supernova discovered to date. The E(B - V) contribution from the underlying host galaxy is unconstrained. However, even if it were as large as 0.5 mag, the peak absolute magnitude would be M<SUB>r</SUB> = -13.78 ± 0.20 mag-still consistent with being the lowest-luminosity SN. Optical spectra of SN 2021fcg taken at 37 and 65 days post-maximum show strong [Ca II], Ca II, and Na I D emission and several weak [Fe II] emission lines. The [Ca II] emission in the two spectra has extremely low velocities of ≈1300 and 1000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. The spectra very closely resemble those of the very low luminosity Type Iax supernovae SN 2008 ha, SN 2010ae, and SN 2019gsc taken at similar phases. The peak bolometric luminosity of SN 2021fcg is ≈ ${2.5}_{-0.3}^{+1.5}\times {10}^{40}$ erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is a factor of 3 lower than that for SN 2008 ha. The bolometric lightcurve of SN 2021fcg is consistent with a very low ejected nickel mass (M ${}_{\mathrm{Ni}}\approx {0.8}_{-0.5}^{+0.4}\times {10}^{-3}$ M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). The low luminosity and nickel mass of SN 2021fcg pose a challenge to the picture that low-luminosity SNe Iax originate from deflagrations of near-M<SUB>ch</SUB> hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon white dwarfs. Instead, the merger of a carbon-oxygen and oxygen-neon white dwarf is a promising model to explain SN 2021fcg.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...921L...6K,[]
Photometric Variability of the Pre-main-sequence Stars toward the Sh 2-190 Region,"We present the results from our time-series imaging data taken with the 1.3 m Devasthal fast optical telescope and 0.81 m Tenagara telescope in V, R<SUB>c</SUB>, and I<SUB>c</SUB> bands covering an area of ~18'4 × 18'4 toward the star-forming region Sh 2-190. This photometric data helped us to explore the nature of the variability of pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars. We have identified 85 PMS variables, i.e., 37 Class II and 48 Class III sources. Forty-five of the PMS variables show periodicity in their light curves. We show that the stars with thicker disks and envelopes rotate slower and exhibit larger photometric variations compared to their diskless counterparts. This result suggests that rotation of the PMS stars is regulated by the presence of circumstellar disks. We also found that the periods of the stars show a decreasing trend with increasing mass in the range of ~0.5-2.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Our result indicates that most of the variability in Class II sources is ascribed to the presence of a thick disk, while the presence of cool spots on the stellar surface causes the brightness variation in Class III sources. X-ray activities in the PMS stars were found to be at the saturation level reported for the main-sequence stars. The younger counterparts of the PMS variables show less X-ray activity, hinting at a less significant role of a stellar disk in X-ray generation.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...921..165S,[]
No Detectable Kilonova Counterpart is Expected for O3 Neutron Star-Black Hole Candidates,"We analyze the tidal disruption probability of potential neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger gravitational-wave (GW) events, including GW190426_152155, GW190814, GW200105_162426, and GW200115_042309, detected during the third observing run of the LIGO/Virgo Collaboration and the detectability of kilonova emission in connection with these events. The posterior distributions of GW190814 and GW200105_162426 show that they must be plunging events, and hence no kilonova signal is expected from these events. With the stiffest NS equation of state allowed by the constraint of GW170817 taken into account, the probability that GW190426_152155 and GW200115_042309 can make tidal disruption is ~24% and ~3%, respectively. However, the predicted kilonova brightness is too faint to be detected for present follow-up search campaigns, which explains the lack of electromagnetic (EM) counterpart detection after triggers of these GW events. Based on the best-constrained population synthesis simulation results, we find that disrupted events account for only ≲20% of cosmological NSBH mergers, since most of the primary BHs could have low spins. The associated kilonovae for those disrupted events will still be difficult for LSST to discover after GW triggers in the future because of their low brightness and larger distances. For future GW-triggered multimessenger observations, potential short-duration gamma-ray bursts and afterglows are more probable EM counterparts of NSBH GW events.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...921..156Z,[]
A Pixon-based Method for Reverberation-mapping Analysis in Active Galactic Nuclei,"We present an alternative method for reconstructing a velocity-delay map in reverberation mapping (RM) based on the pixon algorithm initially proposed for image reconstruction by Pina. The pixon algorithm allows for a variable pixon basis to adjust resolution of each image pixel according to the information content in that pixel, which therefore enables the algorithm to make the best possible use of measured data. The final optimal pixon basis functions would be those that minimize the number of pixons while still providing acceptable descriptions to data within the accuracy allowed by noises. We adapt the pixon algorithm to RM analysis and develop a generic framework to implement the algorithm. Simulation tests and comparisons with the widely used maximum entropy method demonstrate the feasibility and high performance of our pixon-based RM analysis. This paper serves as an introduction to the framework and the application to velocity-unresolved RM. An extension to velocity-resolved cases will be presented in a companion paper.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...921..151L,[]
Exploring the Stellar Rotation of Early-type Stars in the LAMOST Medium-resolution Survey. II. Statistics,"Angular momentum is a key property regulating star formation and evolution. However, the physics driving the distribution of the stellar rotation rates of early-type main-sequence stars is as yet poorly understood. Using our catalog of 40,034 early-type stars with homogeneous $v\sin i$ parameters, we review the statistical properties of their stellar rotation rates. We discuss the importance of possible contaminants, including binaries and chemically peculiar stars. Upon correction for projection effects and rectification of the error distribution, we derive the distributions of our sample's equatorial rotation velocities, which show a clear dependence on stellar mass. Stars with masses less than 2.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> exhibit a unimodal distribution, with the peak velocity ratio increasing as stellar mass increases. A bimodal rotation distribution, composed of two branches of slowly and rapidly rotating stars, emerges for more massive stars (M > 2.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). For stars more massive than 3.0 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, the gap between the bifurcated branches becomes prominent. For the first time, we find that metal-poor ([M/H] < -0.2 dex) stars only exhibit a single branch of slow rotators, while metal-rich ([M/H] > 0.2 dex) stars clearly show two branches. The difference could be attributed to unexpectedly high spin-down rates and/or in part strong magnetic fields in the metal-poor subsample.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...921..145S,[]
Ross 19B: An Extremely Cold Companion Discovered via the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 Citizen Science Project,"Through the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 citizen science project, we have identified a wide-separation (~10', ~9900 au projected) substellar companion to the nearby (~17.5 pc), mid-M dwarf Ross 19. We have developed a new formalism for determining chance alignment probabilities based on the BANYAN Σ tool, and find a 100% probability that this is a physically associated pair. Through a detailed examination of Ross 19A, we find that the system is metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -0.40 ± 0.12) with an age of ${7.2}_{-3.6}^{+3.8}$ Gyr. Combining new and existing photometry and astrometry, we find that Ross 19B is one of the coldest known wide-separation companions, with a spectral type on the T/Y boundary, an effective temperature of ${500}_{-100}^{+115}$ K, and a mass in the range 15-40 M<SUB>Jup</SUB>.

Discovery of deep eclipses in the cataclysmic variable ZTF17aaaeefu (2MASS J00594349+6454419),"I performed photometric observations of the cataclysmic variable candidate ZTF17aaaeefu and discovered very deep eclipses. The observations were obtained over 8 nights covering 7 months. The eclipse profile is similar to the eclipse profiles observed in other cataclysmic variables. During the observations, ZTF17aaaeefu showed brightness changes resembling dwarf nova outbursts and quiescent states. When ZTF17aaaeefu was bright (16.0-16.2 mag), the average eclipse depth was 2.50 ±0.18 mag. When ZTF17aaaeefu was faint (17.2-17.4 mag), the average eclipse depth was 1.45 ±0.06 mag. However, these differences in the eclipse depth may be mainly caused by the contaminating effect of three faint stars around ZTF17aaaeefu. In both cases, the average width of the prominent parts of the eclipses was the same and was about 30 min. Due to the large coverage of observations, I measured the orbital period with high precision, P<SUB>orb</SUB>=0.188 211 55 ±0.000 000 14 d. I derived the eclipse ephemeris, the validity time of which is 700 years in accordance with the precision of the orbital period. This ephemeris can be used for future studies of the orbital period changes. Because ZTF17aaaeefu has a long orbital period, this cataclysmic variable is of interest for determining the masses of its stellar components. In future radial velocity measurements, my precise eclipse ephemeris may be useful for determining the orbital phases.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021Ap&SS.366..111K,[]
Classical Cepheids in the Milky Way,"We share the most up-to-date, carefully verified list of classical Cepheids residing in the Galaxy.

Only objects confirmed in the optical range as classical Cepheids are included in the list. We provide Gaia EDR3 identifications of the stars. Purity of the sample exceeds 97 per cent, while its completeness is of about 88 per cent down to a magnitude G = 18.

Searching for Changing-state AGNs in Massive Data Sets. I. Applying Deep Learning and Anomaly-detection Techniques to Find AGNs with Anomalous Variability Behaviors,"The classic classification scheme for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) was recently challenged by the discovery of the so-called changing-state (changing-look) AGNs. The physical mechanism behind this phenomenon is still a matter of open debate and the samples are too small and of serendipitous nature to provide robust answers. In order to tackle this problem, we need to design methods that are able to detect AGNs right in the act of changing state. Here we present an anomaly-detection technique designed to identify AGN light curves with anomalous behaviors in massive data sets. The main aim of this technique is to identify CSAGN at different stages of the transition, but it can also be used for more general purposes, such as cleaning massive data sets for AGN variability analyses. We used light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility data release 5 (ZTF DR5), containing a sample of 230,451 AGNs of different classes. The ZTF DR5 light curves were modeled with a Variational Recurrent Autoencoder (VRAE) architecture, that allowed us to obtain a set of attributes from the VRAE latent space that describes the general behavior of our sample. These attributes were then used as features for an Isolation Forest (IF) algorithm that is an anomaly detector for a ""one class"" kind of problem. We used the VRAE reconstruction errors and the IF anomaly score to select a sample of 8809 anomalies. These anomalies are dominated by bogus candidates, but we were able to identify 75 promising CSAGN candidates.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..206S,[]
TESS and ZTF Observations of an Eclipsing Z Cam-type Dwarf Nova IPHAS J051814.34+294113.2,"We present an analysis of both Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations of the eclipsing cataclysmic variable IPHAS J051814.34+294113.2 (IPHAS J0518). The TESS light curve shows numerous eclipses superimposed on two outbursts, and ZTF data show frequently outbursts recurring on average every 20.7 days and 12.9 days for long and short outbursts, respectively. This makes IPHAS J0518 to be identified as a possible Z Cam-type dwarf nova. Its quiescent magnitude is ~16.7 in the g band. The orbital period is determined to be 4.95 hr. By combining the observed orbital period with the semiempirical relations of Knigge et al., we estimate the donor mass as M<SUB>2</SUB> = 0.48M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The eclipse phase measurements are used to constrain the binary parameters. The orbital inclination is limited in the range of 75°3 ≤ i < 81°7, and the mass ratio is derived as 0.33 < q ≤ 0.73. Furthermore, we analysis the accretion disk eclipse and find that the total disk eclipse is possible during quiescence, whereas during outburst the disk would be only partially obscured. This indicates that the disk will become larger as the outburst proceeds. We also study the changes of the eclipse depth against the out-of-eclipse flux in IPHAS J0518. The results show evidence of the expansion in the disk size and the variations in the radial-temperature gradient during outburst.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..205H,[]
"The Type II supernova SN 2020jfo in M 61, implications for progenitor system, and explosion dynamics","We present the discovery and extensive follow-up observations of SN 2020jfo, a Type IIP supernova (SN) in the nearby (14.5 Mpc) galaxy M 61. Optical light curves (LCs) and spectra from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), complemented with data from Swift/UVOT and near-infrared photometry is presented. These were used to model the 350-day duration bolometric light curve, which exhibits a relatively short (∼65 days) plateau. This implies a moderate ejecta mass (∼5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) at the time of explosion, whereas the deduced amount of ejected radioactive nickel is ∼0.025 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. An extensive series of spectroscopy is presented, including spectropolarimetric observations. The nebular spectra are dominated by Hα, but also reveal emission lines from oxygen and calcium. Comparisons to synthetic nebular spectra indicate an initial progenitor mass of ∼12 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We also note the presence of stable nickel in the nebular spectrum, and SN 2020jfo joins a small group of SNe that have inferred super-solar Ni/Fe ratios. Several years of prediscovery data were examined, but no signs of precursor activity were found. Pre-explosion Hubble Space Telescope imaging reveals a probable progenitor star, detected only in the reddest band (M<SUB>F814W</SUB> ≈ −5.8) and it is fainter than expected for stars in the 10−15 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> range. There is thus some tension between the LC analysis, the nebular spectral modeling, and the pre-explosion imaging. To compare and contrast, we present two additional core-collapse SNe monitored by the ZTF, which also have nebular Hα-dominated spectra. This illustrates how the absence or presence of an interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) affect both the LCs and in particular the nebular spectra. Type II SN 2020amv has a LC powered by CSM interaction, in particular after ∼40 days when the LC is bumpy and slowly evolving. The late-time spectra show strong Hα emission with a structure suggesting emission from a thin, dense shell. The evolution of the complex three-horn line profile is reminiscent of that observed for SN 1998S. Finally, SN 2020jfv has a poorly constrained early-time LC, but it is of interest because of the transition from a hydrogen-poor Type IIb to a Type IIn, where the nebular spectrum after the light-curve rebrightening is dominated by Hα, although with an intermediate line width.",,[]

A low-energy explosion yields the underluminous Type IIP SN 2020cxd,"Context. We present our observations and analysis of SN 2020cxd, a low-luminosity (LL), long-lived Type IIP supernova (SN). This object is a clear outlier in the magnitude-limited SN sample recently presented by the Zwicky Transient Facility's (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey.",,[]
Aims: We demonstrate that SN 2020cxd is an additional member of the group of LL SNe and we discuss the rarity of LL SNe in the context of the ZTF survey. We consider how further studies of these faintest members of the core-collapse (CC) SN family might help improve the general understanding of the underlying initial mass function for stars that explode.,,,[]
"Methods: We used optical light curves (LCs) from the ZTF in the gri bands and several epochs of ultraviolet data from the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory as well as a sequence of optical spectra. We constructed the colour curves and a bolometric LC. Then we compared the evolution of the ejecta velocity and black-body temperature for LL SNe as well as for typical Type II SNe. Furthermore, we adopted a Monte Carlo code that fits semi-analytic models to the LC of SN 2020cxd, which allows for the estimation of the physical parameters. Using our late-time nebular spectra, we also make a comparison against SN II spectral synthesis models from the literature to constrain the progenitor properties of SN 2020cxd.",,,[]
"Results: The LCs of SN 2020cxd show a great similarity with those of LL SNe IIP in terms of luminosity, timescale, and colours. Also, the spectral evolution of SN 2020cxd is that of a Type IIP SN. The spectra show prominent and narrow P-Cygni lines, indicating low expansion velocities. This is one of the faintest LL SNe observed, with an absolute plateau magnitude of M<SUB>r</SUB> = −14.5 mag and also one with the longest plateau lengths, with a duration of 118 days. Finally, the velocities measured from the nebular emission lines are among the lowest ever seen in a SN, with an intrinsic full width at half maximum value of 478 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>. The underluminous late-time exponential LC tail indicates that the mass of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni ejected during the explosion is much smaller than the average of normal SNe IIP, we estimate M<SUB><SUP>56</SUP>Ni</SUB> = 0.003 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The Monte Carlo fitting of the bolometric LC suggests that the progenitor of SN 2020cxd had a radius of R<SUB>0</SUB> = 1.3 × 10<SUP>13</SUP> cm, kinetic energy of E<SUB>kin</SUB> = 4.3 × 10<SUP>50</SUP> erg, and ejecta mass of M<SUB>ej</SUB> = 9.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. From the bolometric LC, we estimated the total radiated energy E<SUB>rad</SUB> = 1.52 × 10<SUP>48</SUP> erg. Using our late-time nebular spectra, we compared these results against SN II spectral synthesis models to constrain the progenitor zero-age main sequence mass and found that it is likely to be ≲15 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>.",,,[]
"Conclusions: SN 2020cxd is a LL Type IIP SN. The inferred progenitor parameters and the features observed in the nebular spectrum favour a low-energy, Ni-poor, iron CC SN from a low-mass (∼12 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) red supergiant.",,,[]

Threat from Within: Excitation of Venus's Co-orbital Asteroids to Earth-crossing Orbits,"All five currently known asteroids in the 1:1 mean-motion resonance (co-orbital) with Venus cross Earth's orbit. We explore a scenario in which these near-Earth asteroids originate in a reservoir of asteroids co-orbiting with Venus on low-eccentricity orbits. Such an asteroid reservoir was proposed as the only viable source of Venus's co-orbital dust ring. So far, efforts to discover low-eccentricity Venus co-orbital (LEVCO) asteroids have been unsuccessful; however, their existence has not been ruled out. We show that LEVCO asteroids, stable for millions to billions of years, eventually evolve into Earth-crossing configurations, where they may pose a threat to Earth. We find that the orbits of these asteroids cross Earth's orbit for 22.5 million yr, on average, an order of magnitude longer than the corresponding Earth-crossing time of most asteroids escaping from the main belt. Using the results of the latest survey of LEVCO asteroids, we conclude that, given their absolute magnitudes, H, most of the observed Venus co-orbitals likely do not originate from the hypothetical population of LEVCO asteroids. However, we infer that there are up to ~500 asteroids originating from the LEVCO region with H < 26.3 (10-40 m in diameter) that currently cross the orbit of Earth. Up to ~20 of those have H < 24.1 (30-100 m in diameter), easily detectable by various near-Earth asteroid surveys. We estimate the current mass of the LEVCO reservoir as M ≍ 10<SUP>13</SUP>-10<SUP>16</SUP> kg, 3-6 orders of magnitude lower than the current mass of the main belt, depending on their size-frequency distribution.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PSJ.....2..193P,[]
New candidates for AM Canum Venaticorum stars among ASAS-SN transients,"We studied Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) light curves of 34 dwarf nova candidates discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) between 2020 May 12 and September 9 and found six AM CVn-type candidates. All objects showed short outbursts (post-superoutburst rebrightenings) on the fading tail. Two objects (ASASSN-20eq, ASASSN-20la) showed double superoutbursts. Three objects (ASASSN-20jt, ASASSN-20ke, and ASASSN-20lr) showed short superoutbursts (5-6 d). These features in the light curve can be used in discriminating AM CVn-type candidates from hydrogen-rich systems. In contrast to hydrogen-rich systems, some object did not show red color excess during the rebrightening or fading tail phase. We interpret that this is due to the higher ionization temperature in helium disks. Two objects had long (likely) supercycles: ASASSN-20gx (8.5 yr) and ASASSN-20lr (7 yr). We provide a scheme for identifying AM CVn-type candidates based on the light curve characteristics.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASJ...73.1375K,[]

DDOTI observations of gravitational-wave sources discovered in O3,"We present optical follow-up observations with the Deca-Degree Optical Transient Imager (DDOTI) telescope of gravitational-wave (GW) events detected during the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo O3 observing run. DDOTI is capable of responding to an alert in a few minutes, has an instantaneous field of about 69 deg<SUP>2</SUP>, and obtains 10σ upper limits of w<SUB>lim</SUB> = 18.5-20.5 AB mag in 1000 s of exposure, depending on the conditions. We observed 54 per cent (26 out of 48) of the unretracted GW alerts and did not find any electromagnetic counterparts. We compare our upper limits to various possible counterparts: the kilonova AT 2017gfo, models of radioactive- and magnetar-powered kilonovae, short gamma-ray burst afterglows, and active galactic nucleus (AGN) flares. Although the large positional uncertainties of GW sources do not allow us to place strong constraints during O3, DDOTI observations of well-localized GW events in O4 and beyond could meaningfully constrain models of compact binary mergers. We show that DDOTI is able to detect kilonovae similar to AT 2017gfo up to about 200 Mpc and magnetar-powered kilonovae up to 1 Gpc. We calculate that nearby (≲200 Mpc) afterglows have a high chance (≈70 per cent) to be detected by rapid (≲3 h) DDOTI observations if observed on-axis, whereas off-axis afterglows are unlikely to be seen. Finally, we suggest that long-term monitoring of massive BBH events with DDOTI could confirm or rule out late AGN flares associated with these events.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507.1401B,[]
Swift/UVOT follow-up of gravitational wave alerts in the O3 era,"In this paper, we report on the observational performance of the Swift Ultra-violet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) in response to the gravitational wave (GW) alerts announced by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory and the Advanced Virgo detector during the O3 period. We provide the observational strategy for follow-up of GW alerts and provide an overview of the processing and analysis of candidate optical/UV sources. For the O3 period, we also provide a statistical overview and report on serendipitous sources discovered by Swift/UVOT. Swift followed 18 GW candidate alerts, with UVOT observing a total of 424 deg<SUP>2</SUP>. We found 27 sources that changed in magnitude at the 3σ level compared with archival u- or g-band catalogued values. Swift/UVOT also followed up a further 13 sources reported by other facilities during the O3 period. Using catalogue information, we divided these 40 sources into five initial classifications: 11 candidate active galactic nuclei (AGNs)/quasars, three cataclysmic variables (CVs), nine supernovae, 11 unidentified sources that had archival photometry, and six uncatalogued sources for which no archival photometry was available. We have no strong evidence to identify any of these transients as counterparts to the GW events. The 17 unclassified sources are likely a mix of AGN and a class of fast-evolving transient, and one source may be a CV.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507.1296O,[]
Binary evolution pathways of blue large-amplitude pulsators,"Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) are a recently discovered class of pulsating star, believed to be proto-white dwarfs, produced by mass stripping of a red giant when it has a small helium core. An outstanding question is why the stars in this class of pulsator seem to form two distinct groups by surface gravity, despite predictions that stars in the gap between them should also pulsate. We use a binary population synthesis model to identify potential evolutionary pathways that a star can take to become a BLAP. We find that BLAPs can be produced either through common envelope evolution or through Roche lobe overflow, with a main-sequence star or an evolved compact object being responsible for the envelope stripping. The mass distribution of the inferred population indicates that fewer stars would be expected in the range of masses intermediate to the two known groups of pulsators, suggesting that the lack of observational discoveries in this region may be a result of the underlying population of pre-white dwarf stars. We also consider metallicity variation and find evidence that BLAPs at Z = 0.010 (half-solar) would be pulsationally unstable and may also be more common. Based on this analysis, we expect the Milky Way to host around 12 000 BLAPs and we predict the number density of sources expected in future observations such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time at the Vera Rubin Observatory.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507..621B,[]
Simulating a stellar contact binary merger - I. Stellar models,"We study the initial conditions of a common envelope (CE) event resulting in a stellar merger. A merger's dynamics could be understood through its light curve, but no synthetic light curve has yet been created for the full evolution. Using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code STARSMASHER, we have created three-dimensional (3D) models of a 1.52 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> star that is a plausible donor in the V1309 Sco progenitor. The integrated total energy profiles of our 3D models match their initial one-dimensional (1D) models to within a 0.1 per cent difference in the top 0.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of their envelopes. We have introduced a new method for obtaining radiative flux by linking intrinsically optically thick SPH particles to a single stellar envelope solution from a set of unique solutions. For the first time, we calculated our 3D models' effective temperatures to within a few per cent of the initial 1D models, and found a corresponding improvement in luminosity by a factor of ≳10<SUP>6</SUP> compared to ray tracing. We let our highest resolution 3D model undergo Roche lobe overflow with a 0.16 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> point-mass accretor (P ≃ 1.6 d) and found a bolometric magnitude variability amplitude of ~0.3 - comparable to that of the V1309 Sco progenitor. Our 3D models are, in the top 0.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of the envelope and in terms of total energy, the most accurate models so far of the V1309 Sco donor star. A dynamical simulation that uses the initial conditions we presented in this paper can be used to create the first ever synthetic CE evolution light curve.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507..385H,[]
Predicting the self-lensing population in optical surveys,"The vast majority of binaries containing a compact object and a regular star spend most of their time in a quiescent state where no strong interactions occur between components. Detection of these binaries is extremely challenging and only few candidates have been detected through optical spectroscopy. Self-lensing represents a new means of detecting compact objects in binaries, where gravitational lensing of the light from the visible component by the compact object produces periodic optical flares. Here we show that current and planned large-area optical surveys can detect a significant number (~100-10 000s) of these self-lensing binaries and provide insights into the properties of the compact lenses. We show that many of the predicted population of observable self-lensing binaries will be observed with multiple self-lensing flares; this both improves the chances of detection and also immediately distinguishes them from chance-alignment micro-lensing events. Through self-lensing we can investigate long - but previously hidden - stages of binary evolution and consequently provide new constraints on evolutionary models that impact the number and nature of double compact object mergers.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507..374W,[]
"HiPERCAM: a quintuple-beam, high-speed optical imager on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias","HiPERCAM is a portable, quintuple-beam optical imager that saw first light on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) in 2018. The instrument uses re-imaging optics and four dichroic beamsplitters to record $u_{\rm s}\, g_{\rm s}\, r_{\rm s}\, i_{\rm s}\, z_{\rm s}$ (320-1060 nm) images simultaneously on its five CCD cameras, each of 3.1-arcmin (diagonal) field of view. The detectors in HiPERCAM are frame-transfer devices cooled thermo-electrically to 183 K, thereby allowing both long-exposure, deep imaging of faint targets, as well as high-speed (over 1000 windowed frames per second) imaging of rapidly varying targets. A comparison-star pick-off system in the telescope focal plane increases the effective field of view to 6.7 arcmin for differential photometry. Combining HiPERCAM with the world's largest optical telescope enables the detection of astronomical sources to g<SUB>s</SUB> ~ 23 in 1 s and g<SUB>s</SUB> ~ 28 in 1 h. In this paper, we describe the scientific motivation behind HiPERCAM, present its design, report on its measured performance, and outline some planned enhancements.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507..350D,[]
A survey for variable young stars with small telescopes - IV. Rotation periods of YSOs in IC 5070,"Studying rotational variability of young stars is enabling us to investigate a multitude of properties of young star-disc systems. We utilize high cadence, multiwavelength optical time series data from the Hunting Outbursting Young Stars citizen science project to identify periodic variables in the Pelican Nebula (IC 5070). A double blind study using nine different period-finding algorithms was conducted and a sample of 59 periodic variables was identified. We find that a combination of four period finding algorithms can achieve a completeness of 85 per cent and a contamination of 30 per cent in identifying periods in inhomogeneous data sets. The best performing methods are periodograms that rely on fitting a sine curve. Utilizing Gaia EDR3 data, we have identified an unbiased sample of 40 periodic young stellar objects (YSOs), without using any colour or magnitude selections. With a 98.9 per cent probability, we can exclude a homogeneous YSO period distribution. Instead, we find a bi-modal distribution with peaks at 3 and 8 d. The sample has a disc fraction of 50 per cent, and its statistical properties are in agreement with other similarly aged YSOs populations. In particular, we confirm that the presence of the disc is linked to predominantly slow rotation and find a probability of 4.8 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> that the observed relation between period and presence of a disc has occurred by chance. In our sample of periodic variables, we also find pulsating giants, an eclipsing binary, and potential YSOs in the foreground of IC 5070.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.5989F,[]
Carbon-enhanced stars with short orbital and spin periods,"Many characteristics of dwarf carbon stars are broadly consistent with a binary origin, including mass transfer from an evolved companion. While the population overall appears to have old-disc or halo kinematics, roughly 2 per cent of these stars exhibit Hα emission, which in low-mass main-sequence stars is generally associated with rotation and relative youth. Its presence in an older population therefore suggests either irradiation or spin-up. This study presents time-series analyses of photometric and radial-velocity data for seven dwarf carbon stars with Hα emission. All are shown to have photometric periods in the range 0.2-5.2 d, and orbital periods of similar length, consistent with tidal synchronization. It is hypothesized that dwarf carbon stars with emission lines are the result of close-binary evolution, indicating that low-mass, metal-weak, or metal-poor stars can accrete substantial material prior to entering a common-envelope phase.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.4877W,[]
A systematic reclassification of Type IIn supernovae,"Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are a relatively infrequently observed subclass of SNe whose photometric and spectroscopic properties are varied. A common thread among SNe IIn is the complex multiple-component hydrogen Balmer lines. Owing to the heterogeneity of SNe IIn, online data bases contain some outdated, erroneous, or even contradictory classifications. SN IIn classification is further complicated by SN 'impostors' and contamination from underlying H II regions. We have compiled a catalogue of systematically classified nearby (redshift z < 0.02) SNe IIn using the Open Supernova Catalogue (OSC). We present spectral classifications for 115 objects previously classified as SNe IIn. Our classification is based on results obtained by fitting multiple Gaussians to the H α profiles. We compare classifications reported by the OSC and Transient Name Server (TNS) along with the best matched templates from SNID . We find that 28 objects have been misclassified as SNe IIn. TNS and OSC can be unreliable; they disagree on the classifications of 51 of the objects and contain a number of erroneous classifications. Furthermore, OSC and TNS hold misclassifications for 34 and 12 (respectively) of the transients we classify as SNe IIn. In total, we classify 87 SNe IIn. We highlight the importance of ensuring that online data bases remain up to date when new or even contemporaneous data become available. Our work shows the great range of spectral properties and features that SNe IIn exhibit, which may be linked to multiple progenitor channels and environment diversity. We set out a classification scheme for SNe IIn based on the H α profile that is not greatly affected by the inhomogeneity of SNe IIn.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.4715R,[]
Multi-messenger emission from the parsec-scale jet of the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 1502+106 coincident with high-energy neutrino IceCube-190730A,"On July 30th, 2019 IceCube detected a high-energy astrophysical muon neutrino candidate, IC-190730A with a 67% probability of astrophysical origin. The flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) PKS 1502 +106 is in the error circle of the neutrino. Motivated by this observation, we study PKS 1502+106 as a possible source of IC-190730A. PKS 1502+106 was in a quiet state in terms of UV/optical/X-ray/γ-ray flux at the time of the neutrino alert, we therefore model the expected neutrino emission from the source during its average long-term state, and investigate whether the emission of IC-190730A as a result of the quiet long-term emission of PKS 1502+106 is plausible. We analyse UV/optical and X-ray data and collect additional observations from the literature to construct the multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution of PKS 1502+106. We perform leptohadronic modelling of the multi-wavelength emission of the source and determine the most plausible emission scenarios and the maximum expected accompanying neutrino flux. A model in which the multi-wavelength emission of PKS 1502+106 originates beyond the broad-line region and inside the dust torus is most consistent with the observations. In this scenario, PKS 1502+106 can have produced up to of order one muon neutrino with energy exceeding 100 TeV in the lifetime of IceCube. An appealing feature of this model is that the required proton luminosity is consistent with the average required proton luminosity if blazars power the observed ultra-high-energy-cosmic-ray flux and well below the source's Eddington luminosity. If such a model is ubiquitous among FSRQs, additional neutrinos can be expected from other bright sources with energy ≳ 10 PeV.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JCAP...10..082O,[]
Observations of Candidates for Eclipsing Cataclysmic Variables with the RTT-150 Telescope,"We present the results of our photometric and spectroscopic observations.

We have analyzed the observational data and determined the periods of the systems from our photometric data. The object MLS1809017 J224712+461815 has been classified as an SU UMa-type dwarf nova. The remaining three systems are eclipsing ones, with 2XMM J183251.4-100106 and MGAB-V410 showing signatures of polars. At the same time, for MGAB-V410 the orbital period $P_{\textrm{orb}}=2\overset{\textrm{h}}{.}2$ falls into the period gap for cataclysmic variables.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AstL...47..695G,[]
Quantifying Variability of Young Stellar Objects in the Mid-infrared Over 6 Years with the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer,"Variability in young stellar objects (YSOs) can be caused by various time-dependent phenomena associated with star formation, including accretion rates, geometric changes in the circumstellar disks, stochastic hydromagnetic interactions between stellar surfaces and inner-disk edges, reconnections within the stellar magnetosphere, and hot/cold spots on stellar surfaces. We uncover and characterize ~1700 variables from a sample of ~5400 YSOs in nearby low-mass star-forming regions using mid-IR light curves obtained from the 6.5 yr Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer All Sky Survey. The mid-IR variability traces a wide range of dynamical, physical, and geometrical phenomenon. We classify six types of YSO mid-IR variability based on their light curves: secular variability (linear, curved, and periodic) and stochastic variability (burst, drop, and irregular). YSOs in earlier evolutionary stages have higher fractions of variables and higher amplitudes for the variability, with the recurrence timescale of FUor-type outbursts (defined here as ΔW1 or ΔW2 > 1 mag followed by inspection of candidates) of ~1000 yr in the early embedded protostellar phase. Known eruptive young stars and subluminous objects show fractions of variables similar to the fraction (~55%) found in typical protostars, suggesting that these two distinct types are not distinct in variability over the 6.5 yr timescale. Along with brightness variability, we also find a diverse range of secular color variations, which can be attributed to a competitive interplay between the variable accretion luminosity of the central source and the variable extinction by material associated with the accretion process.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...920..132P,[]
A Comprehensive X-Ray Report on AT2019wey,"Here, we present MAXI, Swift, NICER, NuSTAR, and Chandra observations of the X-ray transient AT2019wey (SRGA J043520.9+552226, SRGE J043523.3+552234). From spectral and timing analyses we classify it as a Galactic low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) with a black hole (BH) or neutron star (NS) accretor. AT2019wey stayed in the low/hard state (LHS) from 2019 December to 2020 August 21, and the hard-intermediate state (HIMS) from 2020 August 21 to 2020 November. For the first six months of the LHS, AT2019wey had a flux of ~1 mCrab, and displayed a power-law X-ray spectrum with photon index Γ = 1.8. From 2020 June to August, it brightened to ~20 mCrab. Spectral features characteristic of relativistic reflection became prominent. On 2020 August 21, the source left the ""hard line"" on the rms-intensity diagram, and transitioned from LHS to HIMS. The thermal disk component became comparable to the power-law component. A low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) was observed. The QPO central frequency increased as the spectrum softened. No evidence of pulsation was detected. We are not able to decisively determine the nature of the accretor (BH or NS). However, the BH option is favored by the position of this source on the Γ-L<SUB>X</SUB>, L<SUB>radio</SUB>-L<SUB>X</SUB>, and L<SUB>opt</SUB>-L<SUB>X</SUB> diagrams. We find the BH candidate XTE J1752-223 to be an analog of AT2019wey. Both systems display outbursts with long plateau phases in the hard states. We conclude by noting the potential of SRG in finding new members of this emerging class of low luminosity and long-duration LMXB outbursts.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...920..121Y,[]
Multi-wavelength Observations of AT2019wey: a New Candidate Black Hole Low-mass X-ray Binary,"AT2019wey (SRGA J043520.9+552226, SRGE J043523.3+552234) is a transient first reported by the ATLAS optical survey in 2019 December. It rose to prominence upon detection, three months later, by the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission in its first all-sky survey. X-ray observations reported in Yao et al. suggest that AT2019wey is a Galactic low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) with a black hole (BH) or neutron star (NS) accretor. Here we present ultraviolet, optical, near-infrared, and radio observations of this object. We show that the companion is a short-period (P ≲ 16 hr) low-mass (<1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) star. We consider AT2019wey to be a candidate BH system since its locations on the L<SUB>radio</SUB>-L<SUB>X</SUB> and L<SUB>opt</SUB>-L<SUB>X</SUB> diagrams are closer to BH binaries than NS binaries. We demonstrate that from 2020 June to August, despite the more than 10 times brightening at radio and X-ray wavelengths, the optical luminosity of AT2019wey only increased by 1.3-1.4 times. We interpret the UV/optical emission before the brightening as thermal emission from a truncated disk in a hot accretion flow and the UV/optical emission after the brightening as reprocessing of the X-ray emission in the outer accretion disk. AT2019wey demonstrates that combining current wide-field optical surveys and SRG provides a way to discover the emerging population of short-period BH LMXB systems with faint X-ray outbursts.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...920..120Y,[]
The Final Fates of Close Hot Subdwarf-White Dwarf Binaries: Mergers Involving He/C/O White Dwarfs and the Formation of Unusual Giant Stars with C/O-Dominated Envelopes,"Recently, a class of Roche-lobe-filling binary systems consisting of hot subdwarf stars and white dwarfs (WDs) with sub-hour periods has been discovered. At present, the hot subdwarf is in a shell He-burning phase and is transferring some of its remaining thin H envelope to its WD companion. As the evolution of the hot subdwarf continues, it is expected to detach, leaving behind a low-mass C/O-core WD secondary with a thick He layer. Then, on a timescale of ~10 Myr, gravitational wave radiation will again bring the systems into contact. If the mass transfer is unstable and results in a merger and a catastrophic thermonuclear explosion is not triggered, it creates a remnant with a C/O-dominated envelope, but one still rich enough in He to support an R Corona Borealis-like shell-burning phase. We present evolutionary calculations of this phase and discuss its potential impact on the cooling of the remnant WD.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...920..110S,[]
A Family Tree of Optical Transients from Narrow-line Seyfert 1 Galaxies,"The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) has discovered five events (0.01 < z < 0.4) belonging to an emerging class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) undergoing smooth, large-amplitude, and rapidly rising flares. This sample consists of several transients initially classified as supernovae with narrow spectral lines. However, upon closer inspection, all of the host galaxies display Balmer lines with FWHM(Hβ) ~ 900-1400 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, characteristic of a narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxy. The transient events are long lived, over 400 days on average in the observed frame. We report UV and X-ray follow-up of the flares and observe persistent UV emission, with two of the five transients detected with luminous X-ray emission, ruling out a supernova interpretation. We compare the properties of this sample to previously reported flaring NLSy1 galaxies and find that they fall into three spectroscopic categories: 1) Balmer line profiles and Fe II complexes typical of NLSy1s, 2) strong He II profiles, and 3) He II profiles including Bowen fluorescence features. The latter are members of the growing class of AGN flares attributed to enhanced accretion reported by Trakhtenbrot et al. We consider physical interpretations in the context of related transients from the literature. For example, two of the sources show high-amplitude rebrightening in the optical, ruling out a simple tidal disruption event scenario for those transients. We conclude that three of the sample belong to the Trakhtenbrot et al. class and two are tidal disruption events in NLSy1s. We also hypothesize as to why NLSy1s are preferentially the sites of such rapid enhanced flaring activity.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...920...56F,[]
Search for Neutrinos from the Tidal Disruption Events AT2019dsg and AT2019fdr with the ANTARES Telescope,"On 2019 October 1, the IceCube Collaboration detected a muon track neutrino with a high probability of being of astrophysical origin, IC191001A. After a few hours, the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2019dsg, observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), was indicated as the most likely counterpart of the IceCube track. More recently, the follow-up campaign of the IceCube alerts by ZTF suggested a second TDE, AT2019fdr, as a promising counterpart of another IceCube muon track candidate, IC200530A, detected on 2020 May 30. Here, these intriguing associations are followed-up by searching for neutrinos in the ANTARES detector from the directions of AT2019dsg and AT2019fdr using a time-integrated approach.

Reverberation Mapping of Two Luminous Quasars: The Broad-line Region Structure and Black Hole Mass,"We report the results of a multiyear spectroscopic and photometric monitoring campaign of two luminous quasars, PG 0923+201 and PG 1001+291, both located at the high-luminosity end of the broad-line region (BLR) size-luminosity relation with optical luminosities above 10<SUP>45</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. PG 0923+201 is monitored for the first time, while PG 1001+291 was previously monitored but our campaign has a much longer temporal baseline. We detect time lags of variations of the broad Hβ, Hγ, and Fe II lines with respect to those of the 5100 Å continuum. The velocity-resolved delay map of Hβ in PG 0923+201 indicates a complicated structure with a mix of Keplerian disk-like motion and outflow, and the map of Hβ in PG 1001+291 shows a signature of Keplerian disk-like motion. Assuming a virial factor of f<SUB>BLR</SUB> = 1 and FWHM line widths, we measure the black hole mass to be ${118}_{-16}^{+11}\times {10}^{7}{M}_{\odot }$ for PG 0923+201 and ${3.33}_{-0.54}^{+0.62}\times {10}^{7}{M}_{\odot }$ for PG 1001+291. Their respective accretion rates are estimated to be ${0.21}_{-0.07}^{+0.06}\times {L}_{\mathrm{Edd}}\,{c}^{-2}$ and ${679}_{-227}^{+259}\times {L}_{\mathrm{Edd}}\,{c}^{-2}$ , indicating that PG 0923+201 is a sub-Eddington accretor and PG 1001+291 is a super-Eddington accretor. While the Hβ time lag of PG 0923+201 agrees with the size-luminosity relation, the time lag of PG 1001+291 shows a significant deviation, confirming that in high-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the BLR size depends on both luminosity and Eddington ratio. Black hole mass estimates from single-AGN spectra will be overestimated at high luminosities and redshifts if this effect is not taken into account.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...920....9L,[]
ZTFJ0038+2030: A Long-period Eclipsing White Dwarf and a Substellar Companion,"In a search for eclipsing white dwarfs using the Zwicky Transient Facility lightcurves, we identified a deep eclipsing white dwarf with an orbital period of 10.4 hr and an undetected substellar companion.

A Bright Ultraviolet Excess in the Transitional 02es-like Type Ia Supernova 2019yvq,"We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type Ia SN 2019yvq, from its discovery ~1 day after explosion to ~100 days after its peak brightness. This SN exhibits several unusual features, most notably an extremely bright UV excess seen within ~5 days of its explosion. As seen in Swift UV data, this early excess outshines its ""peak"" brightness, making this object more extreme than other supernovae (SNe) with early UV/blue excesses (e.g., iPTF14atg and SN 2017cbv). In addition, it was underluminous M<SUB>B</SUB> = -18.4, relatively quickly declining (Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(B) = 1.37), and shows red colors past its early blue bump. Unusual (although not unprecedented) spectral features include extremely broad-lined and high-velocity Si absorption. Despite obvious differences in peak spectra, we classify SN 2019yvq as a transitional member of the 02es-like subclass due to its similarities in several respects (e.g., color, peak luminosity, peak Ti, and nebular [Ca II]). We model this data set with a variety of published models, including SN ejecta-companion shock interaction and sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (WD) double-detonation models. Radio constraints from the VLA place an upper limit of (4.5-20) × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> on the mass-loss rate from a symbiotic progenitor, which does not exclude a red giant or main-sequence companion. Ultimately, we find that no one model can accurately replicate all aspects of the data set, and further we find that the ubiquity of early excesses in 02es-like SNe Ia requires a progenitor system that is capable of producing isotropic UV flux, ruling out some models for this class of objects.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...919..142B,[]
Radio Observations of an Ordinary Outflow from the Tidal Disruption Event AT2019dsg,"We present detailed radio observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2019dsg, obtained with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and spanning 55-560 days post disruption. We find that the peak brightness of the radio emission increases until ~200 days and subsequently begins to decrease steadily. Using a standard equipartition analysis, including the effects of synchrotron cooling as determined by the joint VLA-ALMA spectral energy distributions, we find that the outflow powering the radio emission is in roughly free expansion with a velocity of ≈0.07 c, while its kinetic energy increases by a factor of about 5 from 55 to 200 days and plateaus at ≈4.4 × 10<SUP>48</SUP> erg thereafter. The ambient density traced by the outflow declines as radius ≈R<SUP>-1.7</SUP> on a scale of ≈(1-4) × 10<SUP>16</SUP> cm (≈6300-25,000 R<SUB>s</SUB>), followed by a steeper decline to ≈7 × 10<SUP>16</SUP> cm (≈44,000 R<SUB>s</SUB>). Allowing for a collimated geometry, we find that to reach even mildly relativistic velocities (Γ = 2) the outflow requires an opening angle of θ<SUB>j</SUB> ≈ 2°, which is narrow even by the standards of gamma-ray burst jets; a truly relativistic outflow requires an unphysically narrow jet. The outflow velocity and kinetic energy in AT2019dsg are typical of previous non-relativistic TDEs, and comparable to those from type Ib/c supernovae, raising doubts about the claimed association with a high-energy neutrino event.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...919..127C,[]
Phase Separation in Ultramassive White Dwarfs,"Ultramassive white dwarfs are extreme endpoints of stellar evolution. Recent findings, such as a missing multi-Gyr cooling delay for a number of ultramassive white dwarfs and a white dwarf with a quasi-Chandrasekhar mass, motivate a better understanding of their evolution. A key process still subject to important uncertainties is the crystallization of their dense cores, which are generally assumed to be constituted of <SUP>16</SUP>O, <SUP>20</SUP>Ne, and a mixture of several trace elements (most notably <SUP>23</SUP>Na and <SUP>24</SUP>Mg). In this work, we use our recently developed Clapeyron integration technique to compute accurate phase diagrams of three-component mixtures relevant to the modeling of O/Ne ultramassive white dwarfs. We show that, unlike the phase separation of <SUP>22</SUP>Ne impurities in C/O cores, the phase separation of <SUP>23</SUP>Na impurities in O/Ne white dwarfs cannot lead to the enrichment of their cores in <SUP>23</SUP>Na via a distillation process. This severely limits the prospect of transporting large quantities of <SUP>23</SUP>Na toward the center of the star, as needed in the white dwarf core-collapse mechanism recently proposed by Caiazzo et al. We also show that despite representing ≈10% of the ionic mixture, <SUP>23</SUP>Na and <SUP>24</SUP>Mg impurities only have a negligible impact on the O/Ne phase diagram, and the two-component O/Ne phase diagram can be safely used in white dwarf evolution codes. We provide analytic fits to our high-accuracy O/Ne phase diagram for implementation in white dwarf models.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...919...87B,[]
On the Use of Field RR Lyrae as Galactic Probes. V. Optical and Radial Velocity Curve Templates,"We collected the largest spectroscopic catalog of RR Lyrae (RRLs) including ≈20,000 high-, medium-, and low-resolution spectra for ≈10,000 RRLs. We provide the analytical forms of radial velocity curve (RVC) templates. These were built using 36 RRLs (31 fundamental-split into three period bins-and five first-overtone pulsators) with well-sampled RVCs based on three groups of metallic lines (Fe, Mg, Na) and four Balmer lines (H<SUB>α</SUB>, H<SUB>β</SUB>, H<SUB>γ</SUB>, H<SUB>δ</SUB>). We tackled the long-standing problem of the reference epoch to anchor light-curve and RVC templates. For the V-band, we found that the residuals of the templates anchored to the phase of the mean magnitude along the rising branch are ~35% to ~45% smaller than those anchored to the phase of maximum light. For the RVC, we used two independent reference epochs for metallic and Balmer lines and we verified that the residuals of the RVC templates anchored to the phase of mean RV are from 30% (metallic lines) up to 45% (Balmer lines) smaller than those anchored to the phase of minimum RV. We validated our RVC templates by using both the single-point and the three phase point approaches. We found that barycentric velocities based on our RVC templates are two to three times more accurate than those available in the literature. We applied the current RVC templates to Balmer lines RVs of RRLs in the globular NGC 3201 collected with MUSE at VLT. We found the cluster barycentric RV of V<SUB>γ</SUB> = 496.89 ± 8.37(error) ± 3.43 (standard deviation) km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which agrees well with literature estimates.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...919...85B,[]
TOI-1749: an M dwarf with a Trio of Planets including a Near-resonant Pair,"We report the discovery of one super-Earth- (TOI-1749b) and two sub-Neptune-sized planets (TOI-1749c and TOI-1749d) transiting an early M dwarf at a distance of 100 pc, which were first identified as planetary candidates using data from the TESS photometric survey. We have followed up this system from the ground by means of multiband transit photometry, adaptive optics imaging, and low-resolution spectroscopy, from which we have validated the planetary nature of the candidates. We find that TOI-1749b, c, and d have orbital periods of 2.39, 4.49, and 9.05 days, and radii of 1.4, 2.1, and 2.5 R<SUB>⊕</SUB>, respectively. We also place 95% confidence upper limits on the masses of 57, 14, and 15 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> for TOI-1749b, c, and d, respectively, from transit timing variations. The periods, sizes, and tentative masses of these planets are in line with a scenario in which all three planets initially had a hydrogen envelope on top of a rocky core, and only the envelope of the innermost planet has been stripped away by photoevaporation and/or core-powered mass-loss mechanisms. These planets are similar to other planetary trios found around M dwarfs, such as TOI-175b,c,d and TOI-270b,c,d, in the sense that the outer pair has a period ratio within 1% of 2. Such a characteristic orbital configuration, in which an additional planet is located interior to a near 2:1 period-ratio pair, is relatively rare around FGK dwarfs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..167F,[]
THOR: An Algorithm for Cadence-independent Asteroid Discovery,"We present ""Tracklet-less Heliocentric Orbit Recovery"" (THOR), an algorithm for linking of observations of Solar System objects across multiple epochs that does not require intranight tracklets or a predefined cadence of observations within a search window. By sparsely covering regions of interest in the phase space with ""test orbits,"" transforming nearby observations over a few nights into the corotating frame of the test orbit at each epoch, and then performing a generalized Hough transform on the transformed detections followed by orbit determination filtering, candidate clusters of observations belonging to the same objects can be recovered at moderate computational cost and with little to no constraint on cadence. We validate the effectiveness of this approach by running on simulations as well as on real data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Applied to a short, two-week slice of ZTF observations, we demonstrate THOR can recover 97.4% of all previously known and discoverable objects in the targeted (a > 1.7 au) population with five or more observations and with purity between 97.7% and 100%. This includes 10 likely new discoveries, and a recovery of an e ~ 1 comet C/2018 U1 (the comet would have been a ZTF discovery had THOR been running in 2018 when the data were taken). The THOR package and demo Jupyter notebooks are open source and available at https://github.com/moeyensj/thor.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..143M,[]
TOI-532b: The Habitable-zone Planet Finder confirms a Large Super Neptune in the Neptune Desert orbiting a metal-rich M-dwarf host,"We confirm the planetary nature of TOI-532b, using a combination of precise near-infrared radial velocities with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curves, ground-based photometric follow up, and high-contrast imaging. TOI-532 is a faint (J ~ 11.5) metal-rich M dwarf with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3957 ± 69 K and [Fe/H] = 0.38 ± 0.04; it hosts a transiting gaseous planet with a period of ~2.3 days. Joint fitting of the radial velocities with the TESS and ground-based transits reveal a planet with radius of 5.82 ± 0.19 R<SUB>⊕</SUB>, and a mass of ${61.5}_{-9.3}^{+9.7}$ M<SUB>⊕</SUB>. TOI-532b is the largest and most massive super Neptune detected around an M dwarf with both mass and radius measurements, and it bridges the gap between the Neptune-sized planets and the heavier Jovian planets known to orbit M dwarfs. It also follows the previously noted trend between gas giants and host-star metallicity for M-dwarf planets. In addition, it is situated at the edge of the Neptune desert in the Radius-Insolation plane, helping place constraints on the mechanisms responsible for sculpting this region of planetary parameter space.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..135K,[]
Identifying Periodic Variable Stars and Eclipsing Binary Systems with Long-term Las Cumbres Observatory Photometric Monitoring of ZTF J0139+5245,"We present the results of our search for variable stars using the long-term Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) monitoring of white dwarf ZTF J0139+5245 with the two 1.0 m telescope nodes located at McDonald Observatory using the Sinistro imaging instrument. In this search, we find 38 variable sources, of which 27 are newly discovered or newly classified (71%) based on comparisons with previously published catalogs, thereby increasing the number of detections in the field of view under consideration by a factor of ≈2.5. We find that the improved photometric precision per exposure due to longer exposure time for LCO images combined with the greater time sampling of LCO photometry enables us to increase the total number of detections in this field of view. Each LCO image covers a field of view of 26' × 26' and observes a region close to the Galactic plane (b = -9°4) abundant in stars with an average stellar density of ≈8 arcmin<SUP>-2</SUP>. We perform aperture photometry and Fourier analysis on over 2000 stars across 1560 LCO images spanning 537 days to find 28 candidate BY Draconis variables, three candidate eclipsing binaries of type EA, and seven candidate eclipsing binaries of type EW. In assigning preliminary classifications to our detections, we demonstrate the applicability of the Gaia color-magnitude diagram as a powerful classification tool for variable-star studies.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..133S,[]
V-band photometry of asteroids from ASAS-SN. Finding asteroids with slow spin,"We present V-band photometry of the 20 000 brightest asteroids using data from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) between 2012 and 2018. We were able to apply the convex inversion method to more than 5000 asteroids with more than 60 good measurements in order to derive their sidereal rotation periods, spin axis orientations, and shape models. We derive unique spin state and shape solutions for 760 asteroids, including 163 new determinations. This corresponds to a success rate of about 15%, which is significantly higher than the success rate previously achieved using photometry from surveys. We derive the first sidereal rotation periods for additional 69 asteroids. We find good agreement in spin periods and pole orientations for objects with prior solutions. We obtain a statistical sample of asteroid physical properties that is sufficient for the detection of several previously known trends, such as the underrepresentation of slow rotators in current databases, and the anisotropic distribution of spin orientations driven by the nongravitational forces. We also investigate the dependence of spin orientations on the rotation period. Since 2018, ASAS-SN has been observing the sky with higher cadence and a deeper limiting magnitude, which will lead to many more new solutions in just a few years.",,[]

Exploring the nature of ambiguous merging systems: GW190425 in low latency,"GW190425 is a recently discovered gravitational wave (GW) source whose individual binary components are consistent with being neutron stars (NSs). However, the source-frame chirp mass 1.44 ± 0.02 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> is larger than that of any double NS system known as yet, and it falls in the `ambiguous' interval for which the presence of a black hole (BH) cannot be ruled out from the GW signal analysis alone. GW190425 might host an NS and a light BH, with a mass in the so-called lower mass gap. No electromagnetic (EM) counterpart has been associated with this event, due to the poorly informative sky localisation and larger distance compared to GW170817. We construct kilonova (KN) light curve models for GW190425, in both the double NS and BH-NS scenarios, considering two equations of state (EoSs) consistent with current constraints from GW170817 and the NICER results, including BH spin effects, and testing different fitting formulae for the ejecta mass. According to our models, the putative presence of a light BH in GW190425 would have produced a brighter KN emission compared to the double NS case, ideally leading to the possibility of distinguishing the nature of the binary. However, depending on the adopted fitting formula for the ejecta, the feasibility of this distinction might depend on the EoS and on the BH spin. Concerning candidate counterparts of GW190425, classified later on as supernovae, our models could have been used to discard two transients detected in their early r-band evolution, as these fall outside the phase space encompassed by our models. We conclude that combining the chirp mass and distance information from the GW signal with a library of KN light curves can help in identifying the EM counterpart early on, and we stress that the low-latency release of the chirp mass in this interval of ambiguous values can be vital for successful EM follow-ups.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...654A..12B,[]
A transient radio source consistent with a merger-triggered core collapse supernova,"A core collapse supernova occurs when exothermic fusion ceases in the core of a massive star, which is typically caused by exhaustion of nuclear fuel. Theory predicts that fusion could be interrupted earlier by merging of the star with a compact binary companion. We report a luminous radio transient, VT J121001+495647, found in the Very Large Array Sky Survey. The radio emission is consistent with supernova ejecta colliding with a dense shell of material, potentially ejected by binary interaction in the centuries before explosion. We associate the supernova with an archival x-ray transient, which implies that a relativistic jet was launched during the explosion. The combination of an early relativistic jet and late-time dense interaction is consistent with expectations for a merger-driven explosion.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021Sci...373.1125D,[]
The origins of massive black holes,"Massive black holes (MBHs) inhabit galactic centres, and power luminous quasars and active galactic nuclei, shaping their cosmic environment with the energy they produce. The origins of MBHs remain a mystery, and the recent detection by LIGO/Virgo of a black hole of almost 150 solar masses has revitalized the questions of whether there is a continuum between `stellar' and `massive' black holes, and what the seeds of MBHs are. Seeds could have formed in the first galaxies or could be related to the collapse of horizon-sized regions in the early Universe. Understanding the origins of MBHs straddles fundamental physics, cosmology and astrophysics, and bridges the fields of gravitational-wave physics and traditional astronomy. With several existing and upcoming facilities in the next 10-15 years, we foresee the possibility of discovering the avenues of formation of MBHs. This Review links three main topics: the channels of black hole seed formation, the journey from seeds to MBHs, and the diagnostics on the origins of MBHs. We highlight and critically discuss current unsolved problems, touching on recent developments.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatRP...3..732V,[]
Spectroscopic and photometric analysis of symbiotic candidates - I. Ten candidates on classical symbiotic stars,"Symbiotic stars belong to a group of interacting binaries that display a wide variety of phenomena, including prominent outbursts connected with mass transfer, as well as stellar winds, jets, eclipses, or intrinsic variability of the components. Dozens of new symbiotic stars and candidates have been discovered in recent years. However, there are many objects that are still poorly studied. Some symbiotic candidates suspected in the literature have never been studied spectroscopically. In this contribution, we present the first results of the ongoing campaign focused on symbiotic candidates. In the first paper in the series, we study the nature of 10 candidate classical symbiotic stars suspected based on their photometric behaviour, colours or abundance pattern. To confirm or reject the symbiotic nature of the studied candidates, we obtained new spectra and analysed them in detail together with available multifrequency photometric and spectroscopic observations of the objects. Hen 3-860 and V2204 Oph are genuine symbiotic systems showing typical spectral features of burning symbiotic stars and outbursts in the last 100 yr. The first object belongs to the uncommon group of eclipsing symbiotic stars. V1988 Sgr cannot be classified as a genuine burning symbiotic star, but the scenario of an accreting-only symbiotic system cannot be ruled out. Hen 4-204 might be a bonafide symbiotic star due to its similarity with the known symbiotic binary BD Cam. Six other symbiotic candidates (V562 Lyr, IRAS 19050+0001, EC 19249-7343, V1017 Cyg, PN K1-6, V379 Peg) are either single dwarf or giant stars or non-symbiotic binaries.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.4151M,[]
White dwarf planetary debris dependence on physical structure distributions within asteroid belts,"White dwarfs that exhibit transit signatures of planetary debris and accreted planetary material provide exceptional opportunities to probe the material composition and dynamical structure of planetary systems. Although previous theoretical work investigating the role of minor body disruption around white dwarfs has focused on spherical bodies, Solar system asteroids can be more accurately modelled as triaxial ellipsoids. Here, we present an analytical framework to identify the type of disruption (tidal fragmentation, total sublimation, or direct impact) experienced by triaxial asteroids approaching white dwarfs on extremely eccentric (e ~ 1) orbits. This framework is then used to identify the outcomes for simplified Main belt analogues of 100 bodies across five different white dwarf temperatures. We also present an empirical relationship between cooling age and effective temperature for both DA and DB white dwarfs to identify the age of the white dwarfs considered here. We find that using a purely spherical shape model can underestimate the physical size and radial distance at which an asteroid is subjected to complete sublimation, and these differences increase with greater elongation of the body. Contrastingly, fragmentation always occurs in the largest semi-axis of a body and so can be modelled by a sphere of that radius. Both fragmentation and sublimation are greatly affected by the body's material composition, and hence by the composition of their progenitor asteroid belts. The white dwarf temperature, and hence cooling age, can affect the expected debris distribution: higher temperatures sublimate large elongated asteroids, and cooler temperatures accommodate more direct impacts.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.4031M,[]
Discovery of superslow rotating asteroids with ATLAS and ZTF photometry,"We present here the discovery of a new class of superslow rotating asteroids (P<SUB>rot</SUB> ≳1000 h) in data extracted from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) all-sky surveys. Of the 39 rotation periods we report here, 32 have periods longer than any previously reported unambiguous rotation periods currently in the Asteroid Light Curve Data base. In our sample, seven objects have a rotation period >4000 h and the longest period we report here is 4812 h (~200 d). We do not observe any correlation between taxonomy, albedo, or orbital properties with superslow rotating status. The most plausible mechanism for the creation of these very slow rotators is if their rotations were slowed by YORP spin-down. Superslow rotating asteroids may be common, with at least 0.4 per cent of the main-belt asteroid population with a size range between 2 and 20 km in diameter rotating with periods longer than 1000 h.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.3872E,[]
A microlensing search of 700 million VVV light curves,"The VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey and its extension have been monitoring about 560 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of sky centred on the Galactic bulge and inner disc for nearly a decade. The photometric catalogue contains of order 10$^9$ sources monitored in the $K_s$ band down to 18 mag over hundreds of epochs from 2010 to 2019. Using these data we develop a decision tree classifier to identify microlensing events. As inputs to the tree, we extract a few physically motivated features as well as simple statistics ensuring a good fit to a microlensing model both on and off the event amplification. This produces a fast and efficient classifier trained on a set of simulated microlensing events and catacylsmic variables, together with flat baseline light curves randomly chosen from the VVV data. The classifier achieves 97 per cent accuracy in identifying simulated microlensing events in a validation set. We run the classifier over the VVV data set and then visually inspect the results, which produces a catalogue of 1959 microlensing events. For these events, we provide the Einstein radius crossing time via a Bayesian analysis. The spatial dependence on recovery efficiency of our classifier is well characterized, and this allows us to compute spatially resolved completeness maps as a function of Einstein crossing time over the VVV footprint. We compare our approach to previous microlensing searches of the VVV. We highlight the importance of Bayesian fitting to determine the microlensing parameters for events with surveys like VVV with sparse data.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506.2482H,[]
Binary neutron star merger in common envelope jets supernovae,"I explore a triple-star scenario where a tight neutron star (NS)-NS binary system enters the envelope of a red supergiant (RSG) star and spirals-in towards its core. The two NSs accrete mass through accretion discs and launch jets that power a very luminous and long transient event, a common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) event. Dynamical friction brings the two NSs to merge either in the RSG envelope or core. The total energy of the event, radiation and kinetic, is $rsim 10^{52} {~\rm erg}$. The light curve stays luminous for months to years and a signal of gravitational waves might be detected. The ejecta contain freshly synthesized r-process elements not only from the NS-NS merger as in kilonova events, but possibly also from the pre-merger jets that the NSs launch inside the core, as in the r-process CEJSN scenario. This scenario shortens the time to NS-NS merger compared with that of kilonovae, and might somewhat ease the problem of the NS-NS r-process scenario to account for r-process nucleosynthesis in the early Universe. I estimate the ratio of NS-NS merger in CEJSN events to core collapse supernova (CCSN) events to be ≲10<SUP>-6</SUP> - 2 × 10<SUP>-5</SUP>. However, because they are much more luminous I expect their detection fraction to that of CCSNe to be much larger than this number.

SN 2020cpg: an energetic link between Type IIb and Ib supernovae,"Stripped-envelope supernovae (SE-SNe) show a wide variety of photometric and spectroscopic properties. This is due to the different potential formation channels and the stripping mechanism that allows for a large diversity within the progenitors outer envelope compositions. Here, the photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2020cpg covering ~130 d from the explosion date are presented. SN 2020cpg (z = 0.037) is a bright SE-SNe with the B-band peaking at M<SUB>B</SUB> = -17.75 ± 0.39 mag and a maximum pseudo-bolometric luminosity of L<SUB>max</SUB> = 6.03 ± 0.01 × 10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Spectroscopically, SN 2020cpg displays a weak high- and low-velocity H α feature during the photospheric phase of its evolution, suggesting that it contained a detached hydrogen envelope prior to explosion.

Rare events of a peculiar thermonuclear supernova that precedes a core-collapse supernova,"We study stellar binary evolution that leads to the formation of a white dwarf (WD) that explodes in a thermonuclear supernova at the termination of a common envelope evolution (CEE) shortly before the core of its companion explodes as a core-collapse supernova (CCSN). The CCSN explosion of the core, which is the remnant of a red supergiant (RSG) star, might take place few months to several years after the explosion of the WD as a thermonuclear supernova, i.e. a Type Ia peculiar supernova (peculiar SN Ia). Using the evolutionary code MESA-BINARY, we simulate the evolution of binary systems with stars of initial masses of $6\!-\!7.5\, {\rm M}_\odot$. The more massive star, the primary, transfers mass to the secondary star and leaves a CO WD remnant. The secondary becomes massive enough to end in a CCSN. As the secondary evolves to the RSG phase, it engulfs the WD and the system experiences a CEE that ends with a WD-core binary system at an orbital separation of a<SUB>f</SUB> ≃ 1-5 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Our simulations show that the core explodes as a CCSN at $t_{\rm CEE-CCSN} \simeq 3000 \!-\! 10^5 {~\rm yr}$ after the CEE. We assume that if the WD accretes helium-rich gas from the core it might explode as an SN Ia in the frame of the double detonation scenario for SNe Ia and peculiar SNe Ia. We predict the very rare occurrence of a peculiar SN Ia followed within months to years by a CCSN.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.506..919B,[]
The population of near-earth asteroids revisited and updated,"In this paper we update, extend, and improve upon the recent paper on Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) population by Harris and D'Abramo (2015). We update the population estimate taking into account discoveries to August 3, 2020. Shortly after the previous paper was published, we identified a problem in our previous studies due to rounding off of absolute magnitude H by the Minor Planet Center to 0.1 magnitude that implicitly shifted our bin boundaries by 0.05 magnitude. Here we correct the problem by choosing H bin boundaries at 0.25-0.75 magnitude, rather than 0.00-0.50 magnitude thereby eliminating the round-off shift. We also introduce an updated model distribution of NEA orbits (Granvik et al. 2018) in our survey simulations. This new population model includes orbital distributions as a function of size, allowing us to test our presumption that distributions are homologous with respect to size. The change in distribution of orbits between that used by Harris and D'Abramo (2015) and the newer Granvik et al. (2018) distributions was substantially greater than the range over size given in the latter, but made almost no difference in population estimates, suggesting that the re-detection algorithm is robust and does not depend strongly on the detailed orbit distribution, and also validates our presumption of homologous distribution over size. For the current analysis, we have added ATLAS and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to our analysis. We have separately analyzed the re-detection ratio versus size (H magnitude) for each of four surveys (Catalina + Mt. Lemmon, Pan-STARRS, ATLAS and ZTF) to investigate any differences between the various systems and cadences, and found none of significance, thus again, the re-detection algorithm appears very robust and mostly independent of survey parameters. With these changes and more recent discovery statistics to 2020, we estimate the number of NEAs of absolute magnitude H < 17.75 (nominally D > 1 km) to be 940 ± 10. Following the updated population estimate, we examine more closely the rates of discovery of the largest NEAs (absolute magnitude H < 17.75, nominally diameter D > 1 km) to make a more detailed estimate of the numbers of these large objects that remain undiscovered. Lastly we use the distribution of albedos of NEAs from NEOWISE observations (Mainzer et al. 2011) to transform our population estimate from number versus H, N(<H), to number versus D, N(>D).

Yukawa-Casimir wormholes,"In this work, we consider a Yukawa modification of the Casimir wormhole. With the help of an Equation of State, we impose Zero Tidal Forces. We will examine two different approaches: in a first approach, we will fix the form of the shape function of the Casimir wormholes modified by a Yukawa term in three different ways and finally a superposition of different profiles. In the second approach, we will consider the original Casimir source modified by a Yukawa term in three different ways and we will deduce the form of the shape function In both the approaches the reference energy density will be that of the Casimir source.

The Discovery of Two LISA Sources within 0.5 kpc,"We report the discovery of the brightest detached binary white dwarfs with periods less than an hour, which provide two new gravitational-wave verification binaries for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The first one, SMSS J033816.16-813929.9 (hereafter J0338), is a 30.6 minute orbital period, g = 17.2 mag detached double white dwarf binary with a Gaia parallax measurement that places it at a distance of 533 pc. The observed radial velocity and photometric variability provide precise constraints on the system parameters. J0338 contains a 0.230 ± 0.015 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> white dwarf with a ${0.38}_{-0.03}^{+0.05}\,{M}_{\odot }$ companion at an inclination of 69° ± 9°. The second system, SDSS J063449.92+380352.2 (hereafter J0634), is a 26.5 minute orbital period, g = 17.0 mag detached double white dwarf binary at a distance of 435 pc. J0634 contains a ${0.452}_{-0.062}^{+0.070}\,{M}_{\odot }$ white dwarf with a ${0.209}_{-0.021}^{+0.034}\,{M}_{\odot }$ companion at an inclination of 37° ± 7°. The more massive white dwarf in J0634 is hotter than its companion, even though tidal dissipation is predicted to be relatively inefficient at such periods. This suggests that the more massive white dwarf formed last. J0338 and J0634 will be detected by LISA with a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 and 19, respectively, after four years. We identified these two systems based on their overluminosity and u-band photometry. Follow-up of u-band selected Gaia targets will likely yield additional LISA verification binaries.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...918L..14K,[]
Fast-transient Searches in Real Time with ZTFReST: Identification of Three Optically Discovered Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows and New Constraints on the Kilonova Rate,"The most common way to discover extragalactic fast transients, which fade within a few nights in the optical, is via follow-up of gamma-ray burst and gravitational-wave triggers. However, wide-field surveys have the potential to identify rapidly fading transients independently of such external triggers. The volumetric survey speed of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) makes it sensitive to objects as faint and fast fading as kilonovae, the optical counterparts to binary neutron star mergers, out to almost 200 Mpc. We introduce an open-source software infrastructure, the ZTF REaltime Search and Triggering, ZTFReST, designed to identify kilonovae and fast transients in ZTF data. Using the ZTF alert stream combined with forced point-spread-function photometry, we have implemented automated candidate ranking based on their photometric evolution and fitting to kilonova models. Automated triggering, with a human in the loop for monitoring, of follow-up systems has also been implemented. In 13 months of science validation, we found several extragalactic fast transients independently of any external trigger, including two supernovae with post-shock cooling emission, two known afterglows with an associated gamma-ray burst (ZTF20abbiixp, ZTF20abwysqy), two known afterglows without any known gamma-ray counterpart (ZTF20aajnksq, ZTF21aaeyldq), and three new fast-declining sources (ZTF20abtxwfx, ZTF20acozryr, ZTF21aagwbjr) that are likely associated with GRB200817A, GRB201103B, and GRB210204A. However, we have not found any objects that appear to be kilonovae. We constrain the rate of GW170817-like kilonovae to R < 900 Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> (95% confidence). A framework such as ZTFReST could become a prime tool for kilonova and fast-transient discovery with the Vera Rubin Observatory.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...918...63A,[]
"Mass, Spin, and Ultralight Boson Constraints from the Intermediate-mass Black Hole in the Tidal Disruption Event 3XMM J215022.4-055108","We simultaneously and successfully fit the multiepoch X-ray spectra of the tidal disruption event (TDE) 3XMM J215022.4-055108 using a modified version of our relativistic slim disk model that now accounts for angular momentum losses from radiation. We explore the effects of different disk properties and of uncertainties in the spectral hardening factor f<SUB>c</SUB> and redshift z on the estimation of the black hole mass M<SUB>•</SUB> and spin a<SUB>•</SUB>. Across all choices of theoretical priors, we constrain M<SUB>•</SUB> to less than 2.2 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> at 1σ confidence.

Blueshifted Hydrogen Emission and Shock Wave of RR Lyrae Variables in SDSS and LAMOST,"Hydrogen emissions of RR Lyrae variables are the imprints of shock waves traveling through their atmospheres. We develop a pattern recognition algorithm, which is then applied to single-epoch spectra of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope survey. These two spectroscopic surveys covered ~10,000 photometrically confirmed RR Lyrae stars. We discovered in total 127 RR Lyrae stars with blueshifted Balmer emission features, including 103 fundamental mode (RRab), 20 first-overtone (RRc), 3 double-mode (RRd), and 1 Blazhko-type (temporary classification for RR Lyrae stars with strong Blazhko modulation in the Catalina sky survey that cannot be characterized) RR Lyrae variable. This forms the largest database to date of the properties of hydrogen emission in RR Lyrae variables. Based on Zwicky Transient Facility DR5, we carried out a detailed light-curve analysis for the Blazhko-type RR Lyrae star with hydrogen emission of long-term modulations. We characterize the Blazhko-type RR Lyrae star as an RRab and point out a possible Blazhko period. Finally, we set up simulations on mock spectra to test the performance of our algorithm and on the real observational strategy to investigate the occurrence of the ""first apparition.""",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...918....3D,[]
Tidal Disruption Events,"The concept of stars being tidally ripped apart and consumed by a massive black hole (MBH) lurking in the center of a galaxy first captivated theorists in the late 1970s. The observational evidence for these rare but illuminating phenomena for probing otherwise dormant MBHs first emerged in archival searches of the soft X-ray ROSAT All-Sky Survey in the 1990s, but has recently accelerated with the increasing survey power in the optical time domain, with tidal disruption events (TDEs) now regarded as a class of optical nuclear transients with distinct spectroscopic features. Multiwavelength observations of TDEs have revealed panchromatic emission, probing a wide range of scales, from the innermost regions of the accretion flow to the surrounding circumnuclear medium. I review the current census of 56 TDEs reported in the literature, and their observed properties can be summarized as follows: The optical light curves follow a power-law decline from peak that scales with the inferred central black hole mass as expected for the fallback rate of the stellar debris, but the rise time does not. The UV-optical and soft X-ray thermal emission come from different spatial scales, and their intensity ratio has a large dynamic range and is highly variable, providing important clues as to what is powering the two components. They can be grouped into three spectral classes, and those with Bowen fluorescence line emission show a preference for a hotter and more compact line-emitting region, whereas those with only HeII emission lines are the rarest class.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ARA&A..59...21G,[]
A Systematic Search for Outbursting AM CVn Systems with the Zwicky Transient Facility,"AM CVn systems are a rare type of accreting binary that consists of a white dwarf and a helium-rich, degenerate donor star. Using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), we searched for new AM CVn systems by focusing on blue, outbursting stars. We first selected outbursting stars using the ZTF alerts. We cross matched the candidates with Gaia and Pan-STARRS catalogs. The initial selection of candidates based on the Gaia BP-RP contains 1751 unknown objects. We used the Pan-STARRS g-r and r-i color in combination with the Gaia color to identify 59 strong AM CVn candidates. We obtained identification spectra of 35 sources, of which 18 are high-priority candidates, and discovered nine new AM CVn systems and one magnetic CV that shows only He-II lines. Using the outburst recurrence time, we estimate the orbital periods of the nine new AM CVn systems that are in the range of 29-50 minutes. We conclude that targeted follow up of blue, outbursting sources is an efficient method to find new AM CVn systems and we plan to follow up all candidates we identified to systematically study the population of outbursting AM CVn systems.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..113V,[]
"Combining Astrometry and Elemental Abundances: The Case of the Candidate Pre-Gaia Halo Moving Groups G03-37, G18-39, and G21-22","While most moving groups are young and nearby, a small number have been identified in the Galactic halo. Understanding the origin and evolution of these groups is an important piece of reconstructing the formation history of the halo. Here we report on our analysis of three putative halo moving groups: G03-37, G18-39, and G21-22. Based on Gaia EDR3 data, the stars associated with each group show some scatter in velocity (e.g., Toomre diagram) and integrals of motion (energy, angular momentum) spaces, counter to expectations of moving-group stars. We choose the best candidate of the three groups, G21-22, for follow-up chemical analysis based on high-resolution spectroscopy of six presumptive members. Using a new Python code that uses a Bayesian method to self-consistently propagate uncertainties from stellar atmosphere solutions in calculating individual abundances and spectral synthesis, we derive the abundances of α- (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), Fe-peak (Cr, Sc, Mn, Fe, Ni), odd-Z (Na, Al, V), and neutron-capture (Ba, Eu) elements for each star. We find that the G21-22 stars are not chemically homogeneous. Based on the kinematic analysis for all three groups and the chemical analysis for G21-22, we conclude the three are not genuine moving groups. The case for G21-22 demonstrates the benefit of combining kinematic and chemical information in identifying conatal populations when either alone may be insufficient. Comparing the integrals of motion and velocities of the six G21-22 stars with those of known structures in the halo, we tentatively associate them with the Gaia-Enceladus accretion event. <SUP>*</SUP> Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory under ESO program 090.B-0605(A).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..109S,[]
Cataclysmic Variables in the Second Year of the Zwicky Transient Facility,"Using a filter in the GROWTH Marshal based on color and the amplitude and timescale of variability, we have identified 372 objects as known or candidate cataclysmic variables (CVs) during the second year of the operation of the Zwicky Transient Facility. From the available difference imaging data, we found that 93 are previously confirmed CVs and 279 are strong candidates. Spectra of four of the candidates confirm them as CVs by the presence of Balmer emission lines, while one of the four has prominent He II lines indicative of containing a magnetic white dwarf. Gaia EDR3 parallaxes are available for 154 of these systems, resulting in distances from 108-2096 pc and absolute magnitudes in the range of 7.5-15.0, with the largest number of candidates between 10.5 and 12.5. The total numbers are 21% higher than from the previous year of the survey with a greater number of distances available but a smaller percentage of systems close to the Galactic plane. Comparison of these findings with a machine-learning method of searching all the light curves reveals large differences in each data set related to the parameters involved in the search process.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162...94S,[]
Deep transfer learning for the classification of variable sources,"Ongoing or upcoming surveys such as Gaia, ZTF, or LSST will observe the light curves of billions or more astronomical sources. This presents new challenges for identifying interesting and important types of variability. Collecting a sufficient amount of labeled data for training is difficult, especially in the early stages of a new survey. Here we develop a single-band light-curve classifier based on deep neural networks and use transfer learning to address the training data paucity problem by conveying knowledge from one data set to another. First we train a neural network on 16 variability features extracted from the light curves of OGLE and EROS-2 variables. We then optimize this model using a small set (e.g., 5%) of periodic variable light curves from the ASAS data set in order to transfer knowledge inferred from OGLE and EROS-2 to a new ASAS classifier. With this we achieve good classification results on ASAS, thereby showing that knowledge can be successfully transferred between data sets. We demonstrate similar transfer learning using HIPPARCOS and ASAS-SN data. We therefore find that it is not necessary to train a neural network from scratch for every new survey; rather, transfer learning can be used, even when only a small set of labeled data is available in the new survey.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...653A..22K,[]
A characteristic optical variability time scale in astrophysical accretion disks,"Accretion disks around supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei produce continuum radiation at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths. Physical processes in the accretion flow lead to stochastic variability of this emission on a wide range of time scales. We measured the optical continuum variability observed in 67 active galactic nuclei and the characteristic time scale at which the variability power spectrum flattens. We found a correlation between this time scale and the black hole mass extending over the entire mass range of supermassive black holes. This time scale is consistent with the expected thermal time scale at the ultraviolet-emitting radius in standard accretion disk theory. Accreting white dwarfs lie close to this correlation, suggesting a common process for all accretion disks.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021Sci...373..789B,[]
Bounds on GUP parameters from GW150914 and GW190521,"We compute bounds on the GUP parameters for two versions of GUP using gravitational wave data from the events GW150914 and GW190521. The speed of the graviton and photon are calculated in a curved spacetime modified by GUP, assuming that these particles have a small mass. The observational bound on the difference in their speeds translates to bounds on the GUP parameters.

Six Outbursts of Comet 46P/Wirtanen,"Cometary activity is a manifestation of sublimation-driven processes at the surface of nuclei. However, cometary outbursts may arise from other processes that are not necessarily driven by volatiles. In order to fully understand nuclear surfaces and their evolution, we must identify the causes of cometary outbursts. In that context, we present a study of mini-outbursts of comet 46P/Wirtanen. Six events are found in our long-term lightcurve of the comet around its perihelion passage in 2018. The apparent strengths range from -0.2 to -1.6 mag in a 5″ radius aperture and correspond to dust masses between ~10<SUP>4</SUP> and 10<SUP>6</SUP> kg, but with large uncertainties due to the unknown grain size distributions. However, the nominal mass estimates are on the same order of magnitude as the mini-outbursts at comet 9P/Tempel 1 and 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, events that were notably lacking at comet 103P/Hartley 2. We compare the frequency of outbursts at the four comets, and suggest that the surface of 46P has large-scale (~10-100 m) roughness that is intermediate to that of 67P and 103P, if not similar to the latter. The strength of the outbursts appear to be correlated with time since the last event, but a physical interpretation with respect to solar insolation is lacking. We also examine Hubble Space Telescope images taken about two days following a near-perihelion outburst. No evidence for macroscopic ejecta was found in the image, with a limiting radius of about 2 m.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PSJ.....2..131K,[]
Error Analysis of the Light Curve Solution of Contact Binaries Based on the W-D Code,"We use the idea of repeat measurement to determine the mean value and error of light curve solution parameters of contact binaries. Our simulation is realized by the Monte Carlo algorithm and Wilson-Devinney code. This method can obtain systematic and random errors simultaneously. Within our 48 models, the systematic errors are smaller than the random errors in most cases. According to the numerical calculations, it is found that the relative errors of photometric mass ratios are less than 1% for totally eclipsing contact binaries, while they are generally between 10% and 20% for partly eclipsing ones. The effect of third light on the errors of the photometric solution is also investigated. With a third light, these errors are close to 10% for totally eclipsing contact binaries. Especially, it is better to set the third light to zero in flux if that light is very faint (e.g., less than 1% contribution in luminosity), because such faint third light will bring big errors to the light curve solutions.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASP..133h4202L,[]
The GALAH survey and symbiotic stars - I. Discovery and follow-up of 33 candidate accreting-only systems,"We have identified a first group of 33 new candidates for symbiotic stars (SySt) of the accreting-only variety among the 600 255 stars so far observed by the GALactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) high-resolution spectroscopic survey of the Southern hemisphere, more than doubling the number of those previously known. GALAH aims to high latitudes and this offers the possibility to sound the Galaxy for new SySt away from the usual plane and bulge hunting regions. In this paper, we focus on SySt of the M spectral type, showing an Hα emission with a peak in excess of 0.5 above the adjacent continuum level, and not affected by coherent radial pulsations. These constraints will be relaxed in future studies. The 33 new candidate SySt were subjected to an array of follow-up confirmatory observations [X-ray/ultraviolet (UV) observations with the Swift satellite, search for optical flickering, presence of a near-UV upturn in ground-based photometric and spectroscopic data, radial velocity changes suggestive of orbital motion, and variability of the emission-line profiles]. According to Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) parallaxes, the candidate new SySt are located at the tip of the giant branch, sharing the same distribution in M(K<SUB>s</SUB>) of the well-established SySt. The accretion luminosities of the candidate new SySt are in the range 1-10 L<SUB>⊙</SUB>, corresponding to mass accretion rates of 0.1-1 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for white dwarfs of 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>.

SN 2015bf: A fast declining type II supernova with flash-ionized signatures,"We present optical and ultraviolet photometry, as well as optical spectra, for the type II supernova (SN) 2015bf. Our observations cover the phases from ~2 to ~200 d after explosion. The first spectrum is characterized by a blue continuum with a blackbody temperature of ~24 000 K and flash-ionized emission lines. After about 1 week, the spectra of SN 2015bf evolve like those of a regular SN II. From the luminosity of the narrow emission component of H α, we deduce that the mass-loss rate is larger than ${\sim}3.7\times 10^{-3}\, {\rm M_\odot \, yr^{-1}}$. The disappearance of the flash features in the first week after explosion indicates that the circumstellar material is confined within ~6 × 10<SUP>14</SUP> cm. Thus, we suggest that the progenitor of SN 2015bf experienced violent mass loss shortly before the supernova explosion. The multiband light curves show that SN 2015bf has a high peak luminosity with an absolute visual magnitude M<SUB>V</SUB> = -18.11 ± 0.08 mag and a fast post-peak decline with a V-band decay of 1.22 ± 0.09 mag within ~50 d after maximum light. Moreover, the R-band tail luminosity of SN 2015bf is fainter than that of SNe II with similar peak by 1-2 mag, suggesting a small amount of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni (${\sim}0.009\, {\rm M_\odot }$) synthesized during the explosion. Such a low nickel mass indicates that the progenitor of SN 2015bf could be a super-asymptotic-giant-branch star that collapsed owing to electron capture.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.4890L,[]
Light-curve classification with recurrent neural networks for GOTO: dealing with imbalanced data,"The advent of wide-field sky surveys has led to the growth of transient and variable source discoveries. The data deluge produced by these surveys has necessitated the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms to sift through the vast incoming data stream. A problem that arises in real-world applications of learning algorithms for classification is imbalanced data, where a class of objects within the data is underrepresented, leading to a bias for overrepresented classes in the ML and DL classifiers. We present a recurrent neural network (RNN) classifier that takes in photometric time-series data and additional contextual information (such as distance to nearby galaxies and on-sky position) to produce real-time classification of objects observed by the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer, and use an algorithm-level approach for handling imbalance with a focal loss function. The classifier is able to achieve an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.972 when using all available photometric observations to classify variable stars, supernovae, and active galactic nuclei. The RNN architecture allows us to classify incomplete light curves, and measure how performance improves as more observations are included. We also investigate the role that contextual information plays in producing reliable object classification.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.4345B,[]
Predicting electromagnetic counterparts using low-latency gravitational-wave data products,"Searches for gravitational-wave counterparts have been going in earnest since GW170817 and the discovery of AT2017gfo. Since then, the lack of detection of other optical counterparts connected to binary neutron star or black hole-neutron star candidates has highlighted the need for a better discrimination criterion to support this effort. At the moment, low-latency gravitational-wave alerts contain preliminary information about binary properties and hence whether a detected binary might have an electromagnetic counterpart. The current alert method is a classifier that estimates the probability that there is a debris disc outside the black hole created during the merger as well as the probability of a signal being a binary neutron star, a black hole-neutron star, a binary black hole, or of terrestrial origin. In this work, we expand upon this approach to both predict the ejecta properties and provide contours of potential light curves for these events, in order to improve the follow-up observation strategy. The various sources of uncertainty are discussed, and we conclude that our ignorance about the ejecta composition and the insufficient constraint of the binary parameters by low-latency pipelines represent the main limitations. To validate the method, we test our approach on real events from the second and third Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)-Virgo observing runs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.4235S,[]

A high-rate foreground of sub-second flares from geosynchronous satellites,"The Weizmann Fast Astronomical Survey Telescope is a 55 cm optical survey telescope with a high-cadence (25 Hz) monitoring of the sky over a wide field of view (≈7 deg<SUP>2</SUP>). The high frame rate allows detection of sub-second transients over multiple images. We present a sample of ~0.1-0.3 s duration flares detected in an untargeted survey for such transients. We show that most, if not all of them, are glints of sunlight reflected off geosynchronous and graveyard orbit satellites. The flares we detect have a typical magnitude of 9-11, which translates to ~14-16th magnitude if diluted by a 30 s exposure time. We estimate the rate of events brighter than ~11 mag to be of the order of 30-40 events per day per deg<SUP>2</SUP>, for declinations between -20° and +10°, not including the declination corresponding to the geostationary belt directly above the equator, where the rate can be higher. We show that such glints are common in large area surveys (e.g. Zwicky Transient Facility and Legacy Survey of Space and Time), and that some of them have a point-like appearance, confounding searches for fast transients such as fast radio burst counterparts and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). By observing in the direction of the Earth's shadow, we are able to put an upper limit on the rate of fast astrophysical transients of 0.052 deg<SUP>-2</SUP> day<SUP>-1</SUP> (95 per cent confidence limit) for events brighter than 11 mag.

Peculiar-velocity cosmology with Types Ia and II supernovae,"We present the Democratic Samples of Supernovae (DSS), a compilation of 775 low-redshift Type Ia and II supernovae (SNe Ia and II), of which 137 SN Ia distances are derived via the newly developed snapshot distance method. Using the objects in the DSS as tracers of the peculiar-velocity field, we compare against the corresponding reconstruction from the 2M++ galaxy redshift survey. Our analysis - which takes special care to properly weight each DSS subcatalogue and cross-calibrate the relative distance scales between them - results in a measurement of the cosmological parameter combination $f\sigma _8 = 0.390_{-0.022}^{+0.022}$ as well as an external bulk flow velocity of $195_{-23}^{+22}$ km s<SUP>-1</SUP> in the direction $(\ell , b) = (292_{-7}^{+7}, -6_{-4}^{+5})$ deg, which originates from beyond the 2M++ reconstruction.

LAMOST J0140355 + 392651: an evolved cataclysmic variable donor transitioning to become an extremely low-mass white dwarf,"We present LAMOST J0140355 + 392651 (hereafter J0140), a close (P<SUB>orb</SUB> = 3.81 h) binary containing a bloated, low-mass ($M \approx 0.15 \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) proto-white dwarf (WD) and a massive ($M \approx 0.95\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) WD companion. The system's optical light curve is dominated by large-amplitude ellipsoidal variability but also exhibits additional scatter, likely driven by pulsations. The proto-WD is cooler (T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 6800 ± 100 K) and more puffy ($\log \left[g/\left({\rm cm\, s^{-2}}\right)\right]=4.74\pm 0.07$) than any known extremely low-mass (ELM) WD, but hotter than any known cataclysmic variable (CV) donor. It either completely or very nearly fills its Roche lobe ($R/R_{{\rm Roche\, lobe}}=0.99\pm 0.01$), suggesting ongoing or recently terminated mass transfer. No dwarf nova-like outbursts have been observed. The spectrum is dominated by the proto-WD but shows tentative hints of H α emission, perhaps due to accretion on to the massive WD. The properties of the system are well-matched by MESA binary evolution models of CVs with donors that underwent significant nuclear evolution before the onset of mass transfer. In these models, the bloated proto-WD is either still losing mass via stable Roche lobe overflow or was doing so until very recently. In either case, it is evolving towards higher temperatures at near-constant luminosity to become an ELM WD.

Peculiarities of the chemical abundance distribution in galaxies NGC 3963 and NGC 7292,"Spectroscopic observations of 32 H II regions in the spiral galaxy NGC 3963 and the barred irregular galaxy NGC 7292 were carried out with the 2.5-m telescope of the Caucasus Mountain Observatory of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute using the Transient Double-beam Spectrograph with a dispersion of ≈1 Å pixel<SUP>-1</SUP> and a spectral resolution of ≈3 Å. These observations were used to estimate the oxygen and nitrogen abundances and the electron temperatures in H II regions through modern strong-line methods. In general, the galaxies have oxygen and nitrogen abundances typical of stellar systems with similar luminosities, sizes, and morphology. However, we have found some peculiarities in chemical abundance distributions in both galaxies. The distorted outer segment of the southern arm of NGC 3963 shows an excess oxygen and nitrogen abundances. Chemical elements abundances in NGC 7292 are constant and do not depend on the galactocentric distance. These peculiarities can be explained in terms of external gas accretion in the case of NGC 3963 and major merging for NGC 7292.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.2009G,[]
The iron yield of normal Type II supernovae,"We present <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass estimates for 110 normal Type II supernovae (SNe II), computed here from their luminosity in the radioactive tail. This sample consists of SNe from the literature, with at least three photometric measurements in a single optical band within 95-320 d since explosion. To convert apparent magnitudes to bolometric ones, we compute bolometric corrections (BCs) using 15 SNe in our sample having optical and near-IR photometry, along with three sets of SN II atmosphere models to account for the unobserved flux. We find that the I- and i-bands are best suited to estimate luminosities through the BC technique. The <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass distribution of our SN sample has a minimum and maximum of 0.005 and 0.177 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, respectively, and a selection-bias-corrected average of 0.037 ± 0.005 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Using the latter value together with iron isotope ratios of two sets of core-collapse (CC) nucleosynthesis models, we calculate a mean iron yield of 0.040 ± 0.005 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> for normal SNe II. Combining this result with recent mean <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass measurements for other CC SN subtypes, we estimate a mean iron yield <0.068 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> for CC SNe, where the contribution of normal SNe II is >36 per cent. We also find that the empirical relation between <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass and steepness parameter (S) is poorly suited to measure the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass of normal SNe II. Instead, we present a correlation between <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass, S, and absolute magnitude at 50 d since explosion. The latter allows to measure <SUP>56</SUP>Ni masses of normal SNe II with a precision around 30 per cent.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.1742R,[]
Cosmology with LIGO/Virgo dark sirens: Hubble parameter and modified gravitational wave propagation,"We present a detailed study of the methodology for correlating `dark sirens' (compact binaries coalescences without electromagnetic counterpart) with galaxy catalogs. We propose several improvements on the current state of the art, and we apply them to the GWTC-2 catalog of LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave (GW) detections, and the GLADE galaxy catalog, performing a detailed study of several sources of systematic errors that, with the expected increase in statistics, will eventually become the dominant limitation. We provide a measurement of H<SUB>0</SUB> from dark sirens alone, finding as the best result H<SUB>0</SUB> = 67.3<SUP>+27.6</SUP><SUB>-17.9</SUB> km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> (68% c.l.) which is, currently, the most stringent constraint obtained using only dark sirens. Combining dark sirens with the counterpart for GW170817 we find H<SUB>0</SUB> = 72.2<SUP>+13.9</SUP><SUB>-7.5</SUB> km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>. We also study modified GW propagation, which is a smoking gun of dark energy and modifications of gravity at cosmological scales, and we show that current observations of dark sirens already start to provide interesting limits. From dark sirens alone, our best result for the parameter Ξ<SUB>0</SUB> that measures deviations from GR (with Ξ<SUB>0</SUB> = 1 in GR) is Ξ<SUB>0</SUB> = 2.1<SUP>+3.2</SUP><SUB>-1.2</SUB>. We finally discuss limits on modified GW propagation under the tentative identification of the flare ZTF19abanrhr as the electromagnetic counterpart of the binary black hole coalescence GW190521, in which case our most stringent result is Ξ<SUB>0</SUB> = 1.8<SUP>+0.9</SUP><SUB>-0.6</SUB>.

NEOExchange - an online portal for NEO and Solar System science,"Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) has deployed a homogeneous telescope network of ten 1-m telescopes to four locations in the northern and southern hemispheres, with a planned network size of twelve 1-m telescopes at 6 locations. This network is very versatile and is designed to respond rapidly to target of opportunity events and also to perform long term monitoring of slowly changing astronomical phenomena. The global coverage, available telescope apertures, and flexibility of the LCO network make it ideal for discovery, follow-up, and characterization of Solar System objects such as asteroids, Kuiper Belt Objects, comets, and especially Near-Earth Objects (NEOs).",,[]
"We describe the development of the ""LCO NEO Follow-up Network"" which makes use of the LCO network of robotic telescopes and an online, cloud-based web portal, NEOexchange, to perform photometric characterization and spectroscopic classification of NEOs and follow-up astrometry for both confirmed NEOs and unconfirmed NEO candidates.",,,[]
"The follow-up astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic characterization efforts are focused on those NEO targets that are due to be observed by the planetary radar facilities and those on the Near-Earth Object Human Space Flight Accessible Targets Study (NHATS) lists. Our astrometric observations allow us to improve target orbits, making radar observations possible for objects with a short arc or large orbital uncertainty, which could be greater than the radar beam width. Astrometric measurements also allow for the detection and measurement of the Yarkovsky effect on NEOs. The photometric and spectroscopic data allows us to determine the light curve shape and amplitude, measure rotation periods, determine the taxonomic classification, and improve the overall characterization of these targets. We are also using a small amount of the LCO NEO Follow-up Network time to confirm newly detected NEO candidates produced by the major sky surveys such as ATLAS, Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) and PanSTARRS (PS1). We will describe the construction of the NEOexchange NEO follow-up portal and the development and deployment methodology adopted which allows the software to be packaged and deployed anywhere, including in off-site cloud services. This allows professionals, amateurs, and citizen scientists to plan, schedule and analyze NEO imaging and spectroscopy data using the LCO network and acts as a coordination hub for the NEO follow-up efforts. We illustrate the capabilities of NEOexchange and the LCO NEO Follow-up Network with examples of first period determinations for radar-targeted NEOs and its use to plan and execute multi-site photometric and spectroscopic observations of (66391) 1999 KW4, the subject of the most recent planetary defense exercise campaign.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021Icar..36414387L,,[]
The Palomar Transient Factory Core-collapse Supernova Host-galaxy Sample. I. Host-galaxy Distribution Functions and Environment Dependence of Core-collapse Supernovae,"Several thousand core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) of different flavors have been discovered so far. However, identifying their progenitors has remained an outstanding open question in astrophysics. Studies of SN host galaxies have proven to be powerful in providing constraints on the progenitor populations. In this paper, we present all CCSNe detected between 2009 and 2017 by the Palomar Transient Factory. This sample includes 888 SNe of 12 distinct classes out to redshift z ≈ 1. We present the photometric properties of their host galaxies from the far-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared and model the host-galaxy spectral energy distributions to derive physical properties. The galaxy mass function of Type Ic, Ib, IIb, II, and IIn SNe ranges from 10<SUP>5</SUP> to 10<SUP>11.5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, probing the entire mass range of star-forming galaxies down to the least-massive star-forming galaxies known. Moreover, the galaxy mass distributions are consistent with models of star-formation-weighted mass functions. Regular CCSNe are hence direct tracers of star formation. Small but notable differences exist between some of the SN classes. Type Ib/c SNe prefer galaxies with slightly higher masses (i.e., higher metallicities) and star formation rates than Type IIb and II SNe. These differences are less pronounced than previously thought. H-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and SNe Ic-BL are scarce in galaxies above 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Their progenitors require environments with metallicities of < 0.4 and < 1 solar, respectively. In addition, the hosts of H-poor SLSNe are dominated by a younger stellar population than all other classes of CCSNe. Our findings corroborate the notion that low metallicity and young age play an important role in the formation of SLSN progenitors.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..255...29S,[]
A Deep-learning Approach for Live Anomaly Detection of Extragalactic Transients,"There is a shortage of multiwavelength and spectroscopic follow-up capabilities given the number of transient and variable astrophysical events discovered through wide-field optical surveys such as the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory and its associated Legacy Survey of Space and Time. From the haystack of potential science targets, astronomers must allocate scarce resources to study a selection of needles in real time. Here we present a variational recurrent autoencoder neural network to encode simulated Rubin Observatory extragalactic transient events using 1% of the PLAsTiCC data set to train the autoencoder. Our unsupervised method uniquely works with unlabeled, real-time, multivariate, and aperiodic data. We rank 1,129,184 events based on an anomaly score estimated using an isolation forest. We find that our pipeline successfully ranks rarer classes of transients as more anomalous. Using simple cuts in anomaly score and uncertainty, we identify a pure (≈95% pure) sample of rare transients (i.e., transients other than Type Ia, Type II, and Type Ibc supernovae), including superluminous and pair-instability supernovae. Finally, our algorithm is able to identify these transients as anomalous well before peak, enabling real-time follow-up studies in the era of the Rubin Observatory.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..255...24V,[]
SNIascore: Deep-learning Classification of Low-resolution Supernova Spectra,"We present SNIascore, a deep-learning-based method for spectroscopic classification of thermonuclear supernovae (SNe Ia) based on very low-resolution (R ~ 100) data. The goal of SNIascore is the fully automated classification of SNe Ia with a very low false-positive rate (FPR) so that human intervention can be greatly reduced in large-scale SN classification efforts, such as that undertaken by the public Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey (BTS). We utilize a recurrent neural network architecture with a combination of bidirectional long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit layers. SNIascore achieves a <0.6% FPR while classifying up to 90% of the low-resolution SN Ia spectra obtained by the BTS. SNIascore simultaneously performs binary classification and predicts the redshifts of secure SNe Ia via regression (with a typical uncertainty of <0.005 in the range from z = 0.01 to z = 0.12). For the magnitude-limited ZTF BTS survey (≈70% SNe Ia), deploying SNIascore reduces the amount of spectra in need of human classification or confirmation by ≈60%. Furthermore, SNIascore allows SN Ia classifications to be automatically announced in real time to the public immediately following a finished observation during the night.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...917L...2F,[]
The Blue Supergiant Progenitor of the Supernova Imposter AT 2019krl,"Extensive archival Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer Space Telescope, and Large Binocular Telescope imaging of the recent intermediate-luminosity transient, AT 2019krl in M74, reveal a bright optical and mid-infrared progenitor star. While the optical peak of the event was missed, a peak was detected in the infrared with an absolute magnitude of M<SUB>4.5 μm</SUB> = -18.4 mag, leading us to infer a visual-wavelength peak absolute magnitude of -13.5 to -14.5. The pre-discovery light curve indicated no outbursts over the previous 16 yr. The colors, magnitudes, and inferred temperatures of the progenitor best match a 13-14 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yellow or blue supergiant (BSG) if only foreground extinction is taken into account, or a hotter and more massive star if any additional local extinction is included. A pre-eruption spectrum of the star reveals strong Hα and [N II] emission with wings extending to ±2000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The post-eruption spectrum is fairly flat and featureless with only Hα, Na I D, [Ca II], and the Ca II triplet in emission. As in many previous intermediate-luminosity transients, AT 2019krl shows remarkable observational similarities to luminous blue variable (LBV) giant eruptions, SN 2008S-like events, and massive-star mergers. However, the information about the pre-eruption star favors either a relatively unobscured BSG or a more extinguished LBV with M > 20 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> likely viewed pole-on.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...917...63A,[]
Recurring Planetary Debris Transits and Circumstellar Gas around White Dwarf ZTF J0328-1219,"We present follow-up photometry and spectroscopy of ZTF J0328-1219, strengthening its status as a white dwarf exhibiting transiting planetary debris. Using TESS and Zwicky Transient Facility photometry, along with follow-up high-speed photometry from various observatories, we find evidence for two significant periods of variability at 9.937 and 11.2 hr. We interpret these as most likely the orbital periods of different debris clumps. Changes in the detailed dip structures within the light curves are observed on nightly, weekly, and monthly timescales, reminiscent of the dynamic behavior observed in the first white dwarf discovered to harbor a disintegrating asteroid, WD 1145+017. We fit previously published spectroscopy along with broadband photometry to obtain new atmospheric parameters for the white dwarf, with M<SUB>⋆</SUB> = 0.731 ± 0.023 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 7630 ± 140 K, and [Ca/He] = - 9.55 ± 0.12. With new high-resolution spectroscopy, we detect prominent and narrow Na D absorption features likely of circumstellar origin, with velocities 21.4 ± 1.0 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> blueshifted relative to atmospheric lines. We attribute the periodically modulated photometric signal to dusty effluents from small orbiting bodies such as asteroids or comets, but we are unable to identify the most likely material that is being sublimated, or otherwise ejected, as the environmental temperatures range from roughly 400 to 700 K.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...917...41V,[]
Illuminating Black Hole Subsystems in Young Star Clusters,"There is increasing evidence that globular clusters retain sizeable black hole populations at present day. This is supported by dynamical simulations of cluster evolution, which have unveiled the spatial distribution and mass spectrum of black holes in clusters across cosmic age. However, black hole populations of young, high metallicity clusters remain unconstrained. Black holes hosted by these clusters mass segregate early in their evolutionary history, forming central subsystems of hundreds to thousands of black holes. We argue that after supernova feedback has subsided (≳50 Myr), the host cluster can accumulate gas from its dense surroundings, from which the black hole subsystem accretes at highly enhanced rates. The collective accretion luminosity can be substantial and provides a novel observational constraint for young massive clusters. We test this hypothesis by performing 3D hydrodynamic simulations where we embed discretized potentials, representing our black holes, within the potential of a massive cluster. This system moves supersonically with respect to a gaseous medium from which it accretes. We study the accretion of this black hole subsystem for different subsystem populations and determine the integrated accretion luminosity of the black hole subsystem. We apply our results to the young massive clusters of the Antennae Galaxies and find that a typical subsystem accretion luminosity should be in excess of ≈ 10<SUP>40</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We argue that no strong candidates of this luminous signal have been observed and constrain the subsystem population of a typical cluster in the Antennae Galaxies to ≲ 10-2 × 10<SUP>2</SUP> 10 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> black holes, given that feedback does not significantly impede accretion and that the gas remains optically thin.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...917...36K,[]
Kilonova Emission from Black Hole-Neutron Star Mergers. II. Luminosity Function and Implications for Target-of-opportunity Observations of Gravitational-wave Triggers and Blind Searches,"We present detailed simulations of the kilonova and gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow and kilonova luminosity function from black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) mergers, and discuss the detectability of an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart in connection with gravitational wave (GW) detections, GW-triggered target-of-opportunity observations, and time-domain blind searches. The predicted absolute magnitude of BH-NS kilonovae at 0.5 days after the merger falls in the range [-10, -15.5]. The simulated luminosity function contains potential information on the viewing-angle distribution of the anisotropic kilonova emission. We simulate the GW detection rates, detectable distances, and signal duration for future networks of 2nd/2.5th/3rd generation GW detectors. BH-NSs tend to produce brighter kilonovae and afterglows if the BH has a higher aligned spin, and a less massive NS with a stiffer equation of state. The detectability of kilonovae is especially sensitive to the BH spin. If BHs typically have low spins, the BH-NS EM counterparts are hard to discover. For 2nd generation GW detector networks, a limiting magnitude of m<SUB>limit</SUB> ~ 23-24 mag is required to detect kilonovae even if high BH spin is assumed. Thus, a plausible explanation for the lack of BH-NS-associated kilonova detection during LIGO/Virgo O3 is that either there is no EM counterpart (plunging events) or the current follow-ups are too shallow. These observations still have the chance to detect the on-axis jet afterglow associated with a short GRB or an orphan afterglow. Follow-up observations can detect possible associated short GRB afterglows, from which kilonova signatures may be studied. For time-domain observations, a high-cadence search in redder filters is recommended to detect more BH-NS-associated kilonovae and afterglows.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...917...24Z,[]
Discovery of a Fast Iron Low-ionization Outflow in the Early Evolution of the Nearby Tidal Disruption Event AT 2019qiz,"We report the results of ultraviolet (UV) and optical photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT 2019qiz. Our follow-up observations started <10 days after the source began to brighten in the optical and lasted for a period of six months. Our late-time host-dominated spectrum indicates that the host galaxy likely harbors a weak active galactic nucleus. The initial Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectrum of AT 2019qiz exhibits an iron and low-ionization broad absorption line (FeLoBAL) system that is seen for the first time in a TDE. This spectrum also bears a striking resemblance to that of Gaia16apd, a superluminous supernova. Our observations provide insights into the outflow properties in TDEs and show evidence for a connection between TDEs and engine-powered supernovae at early phases, as originally suggested by Metzger & Stone. In a time frame of 50 days, the UV spectra of AT 2019qiz started to resemble those of previous TDEs with only high-ionization broad absorption lines. The change in UV spectral signatures is accompanied by a decrease in the outflow velocity, which began at 15,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and decelerated to ~10,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. A similar evolution in the H&agr; emission-line width further supports the speculation that the broad Balmer emission lines are formed in TDE outflows. In addition, we detect narrow absorption features on top of the FeLoBAL signatures in the early HST UV spectrum of AT 2019qiz. The measured H I column density corresponds to a Lyman-limit system, whereas the metal absorption lines (such as N V, C IV, Fe II, and Mg II) are likely probing the circumnuclear gas and interstellar medium in the host galaxy.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...917....9H,[]
Accretion-modified Stars in Accretion Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei: Gravitational-wave Bursts and Electromagnetic Counterparts from Merging Stellar Black Hole Binaries,"The recent advanced LIGO/Virgo detections of gravitational waves (GWs) from stellar binary black hole (BBH) mergers, in particular GW190521, which is potentially associated with a quasar, have stimulated renewed interest in active galactic nuclei as factories of merging BBHs. Compact objects evolving from massive stars are unavoidably enshrouded by a massive envelope to form accretion-modified stars (AMSs) in the dense gaseous environment of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion disk. We show that most AMSs form binaries due to gravitational interaction with each other during radial migration in the SMBH disk, forming BBHs inside the AMS. When a BBH is born, its orbit is initially governed by the tidal torque of the SMBH. Bondi accretion onto a BBH at a hyper-Eddington rate naturally develops and then controls the evolution of its orbits. We find that Bondi accretion leads to efficient removal of the orbital angular momentum of the binary, whose final merger produces a GW burst. Meanwhile, the Blandford-Znajek mechanism pumps the spin energy of the merged BH to produce an electromagnetic counterpart (EMC). Moreover, hyper-Eddington accretion onto the BBH develops powerful outflows and triggers a Bondi explosion, which manifests itself as an EMC of the GW burst, depending on the viscosity of the accretion flow. Thermal emission from the Bondi sphere appears as one of the EMCs. The BBHs radiate GWs with frequencies of ~10<SUP>2</SUP> Hz, which are accessible to LIGO.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...916L..17W,[]
Cooling Models for the Most Massive White Dwarfs,"We present a set of ultramassive white dwarf models, focused on masses above 1.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Given the uncertainties about the formation and compositions of such objects, we construct parameterized model sequences, guided by evolutionary calculations including both single star and double white dwarf merger formation channels. We demonstrate that the cooling of objects with central densities in excess of 10<SUP>9</SUP> g cm<SUP>-3</SUP> is dominated by neutrino cooling via the Urca process in the first ≈100 Myr after formation. Our models indicate that the recently discovered ultramassive white dwarf ZTF J190132.9+145808.7 is likely to have experienced this Urca-dominated cooling regime. We also show that the high densities imply that diffusion is unlikely to significantly alter the core compositions of these objects before they crystallize.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...916..119S,[]
Zwicky Transient Facility and Globular Clusters: the Period-Luminosity and Period-Luminosity-Color Relations for Late-type Contact Binaries,"In this work, we aimed to derive the gri-band period-luminosity (PL) and period-luminosity-color (PLC) relations for late-type contact binaries, for the first time, located in globular clusters, using the homogeneous light curves collected by the Zwicky Transient Factory (ZTF). We started with 79 contact binaries in 15 globular clusters, and retained 30 contact binaries in 10 globular clusters that have adequate numbers of data points in the ZTF light curves and are unaffected by blending. Magnitudes at mean and maximum light of these contact binaries were determined using a fourth-order Fourier expansion, while extinction corrections were done using the Bayerstar2019 3D reddening map together with adopting the homogeneous distances to their host globular clusters. After removing early-type and ""anomaly"" contact binaries, our derived gri-band PL and period-Wesenheit (PW) relations exhibited a much larger dispersion with large errors on the fitted coefficients. Nevertheless, the gr-band PL and PW relations based on this small sample of contact binaries in globular clusters were consistent with those based on a larger sample of nearby contact binaries. Good agreements of the PL and PW relations suggested both samples of contact binaries in the local Solar neighborhood and in the distant globular clusters can be combined and used to derive and calibrate the PL, PW, and PLC relations. The final derived gr-band PL, PW, and PLC relations were much improved over those based on the limited sample of contact binaries in the globular clusters.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162...63N,[]
SN 2020bqj: A Type Ibn supernova with a long-lasting peak plateau,Context. Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn) are a rare class of stripped envelope supernovae interacting with a helium-rich circumstellar medium (CSM). The majority of the SNe Ibn reported in the literature display a surprising homogeneity in their fast-evolving lightcurves and are typically found in actively starforming spiral galaxies.,,[]
"Aims: We present the discovery and the study of SN 2020bqj (ZTF20aalrqbu), a SN Ibn with a long-duration peak plateau lasting 40 days and hosted by a faint low-mass galaxy. We aim to explain its peculiar properties using an extensive photometric and spectroscopic data set.",,,[]
"Methods: We compare the photometric and spectral evolution of SN 2020bqj with regular SNe Ibn from the literature, as well as with other outliers in the SN Ibn subclass. We fit the bolometric and multi-band lightcurves with powering mechanism models such as radioactive decay and CSM interaction. We also model the host galaxy of SN 2020bqj.",,,[]
"Results: The risetime, peak magnitude and spectral features of SN 2020bqj are consistent with those of most SNe Ibn, but the SN is a clear outlier in the subclass based on its bright, long-lasting peak plateau and the low mass of its faint host galaxy. We show through modeling that the lightcurve of SN 2020bqj can be powered predominantly by shock heating from the interaction of the SN ejecta and a dense CSM, combined with radioactive decay. The peculiar Type Ibn SN 2011hw is a close analog to SN 2020bqj in terms of lightcurve and spectral evolution, suggesting a similar progenitor and CSM scenario. In this scenario a very massive progenitor star in the transitional phase between a luminous blue variable and a compact Wolf-Rayet star undergoes core-collapse, embedded in a dense helium-rich CSM with an elevated opacity compared to normal SNe Ibn, due to the presence of residual hydrogen. This scenario is consistent with the observed properties of SN 2020bqj and the modeling results.",,,[]
"Conclusions: SN 2020bqj is a compelling example of a transitional SN Ibn/IIn based on not only its spectral features, but also its lightcurve, host galaxy properties and the inferred progenitor properties. The strong similarity with SN 2011hw suggests this subclass may be the result of a progenitor in a stellar evolution phase that is distinct from those of progenitors of regular SNe Ibn.",,,[]

"Aims: We present the Gaia Science Alerts project, which has been in operation since 1 June 2016. We describe the system which has been developed to enable the discovery and publication of transient photometric events as seen by Gaia.",,,[]
"Methods: We outline the data handling, timings, and performances, and we describe the transient detection algorithms and filtering procedures needed to manage the high false alarm rate. We identify two classes of events: (1) sources which are new to Gaia and (2) Gaia sources which have undergone a significant brightening or fading. Validation of the Gaia transit astrometry and photometry was performed, followed by testing of the source environment to minimise contamination from Solar System objects, bright stars, and fainter near-neighbours.",,,[]
"Results: We show that the Gaia Science Alerts project suffers from very low contamination, that is there are very few false-positives. We find that the external completeness for supernovae, C<SUB>E</SUB> = 0.46, is dominated by the Gaia scanning law and the requirement of detections from both fields-of-view. Where we have two or more scans the internal completeness is C<SUB>I</SUB> = 0.79 at 3 arcsec or larger from the centres of galaxies, but it drops closer in, especially within 1 arcsec.",,,[]
"Conclusions: The per-transit photometry for Gaia transients is precise to 1% at G = 13, and 3% at G = 19. The per-transit astrometry is accurate to 55 mas when compared to Gaia DR2.

The NAROO digitization center. Overview and scientific program,"The New Astrometric Reduction of Old Observations (NAROO) center can be found at the Paris Observatory in Meudon, and it is dedicated to the measurement of astrophotographic plates and the analysis of old observations. The NAROO digitizer consists of a granite-based Newport-Microcontrol open-frame air-bearing XY positioning table, a scientific sCMOS camera, and a telecentric optical system. The plate holder assembly is suited for mounting glass plates up to 350 mm squared. The machine positioning stability is better than 15 nm, and its repeatability is better than 40 nm. With real photographic plate data, we were able to produce measurements with an accuracy better than 65 nm. The renewed interest about photographic plates concerns the expansion of the database of transient objects evolving in time, since digitization now makes it possible to measure images with a high level of accuracy and to identify all the available objects. The information extracted from such materials can be of an astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic nature, when not purely imaging, with consequences in planetology, near-Earth asteroid risk assessment, astrophysical phenomena, and general relativity, to mention but a few. Through our scientific program in the Gaia era, we detail examples of current and upcoming uses for the community. We invite researchers to use our facilities and digitize their collection by answering our call for proposals.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...652A...3R,[]
The potential role of binary neutron star merger afterglows in multimessenger cosmology,"Binary neutron star mergers offer a new and independent means of measuring the Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB> by combining the gravitational-wave inferred source luminosity distance with its redshift obtained from electromagnetic follow-up. This method is limited by the intrinsic degeneracy between the system distance and orbital inclination in the gravitational-wave signal. Observing the afterglow counterpart to a merger can further constrain the inclination angle, allowing this degeneracy to be partially lifted and improving the measurement of H<SUB>0</SUB>. In the case of the binary neutron star merger GW170817, afterglow light-curve and imaging modeling thus allowed the H<SUB>0</SUB> measurement to be improved by a factor of three. However, systematic access to afterglow data is far from guaranteed. In fact, though each one allows a leap in H<SUB>0</SUB> precision, these afterglow counterparts should prove rare in forthcoming multimessenger campaigns. We combine models for emission and detection of gravitational-wave and electromagnetic radiation from binary neutron star mergers with realistic population models and estimates for afterglow inclination angle constraints. Using these models, we quantify how fast H<SUB>0</SUB> will be narrowed down by successive multimessenger events with and without the afterglow. We find that because of its rareness and though it greatly refines angle estimates, the afterglow counterpart should not significantly contribute to the measurement of H<SUB>0</SUB> in the long run.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...652A...1M,[]
Discovery and confirmation of the shortest gamma-ray burst from a collapsar,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the brightest and most energetic events in the Universe. The duration and hardness distribution of GRBs has two clusters<SUP>1</SUP>, now understood to reflect (at least) two different progenitors<SUP>2</SUP>. Short-hard GRBs (SGRBs; T<SUB>90</SUB> < 2 s) arise from compact binary mergers, and long-soft GRBs (LGRBs; T<SUB>90</SUB> > 2 s) have been attributed to the collapse of peculiar massive stars (collapsars)<SUP>3</SUP>. The discovery of SN 1998bw/GRB 980425 (ref. <SUP>4</SUP>) marked the first association of an LGRB with a collapsar, and AT 2017gfo (ref. <SUP>5</SUP>)/GRB 170817A/GW170817 (ref. <SUP>6</SUP>) marked the first association of an SGRB with a binary neutron star merger, which also produced a gravitational wave. Here, we present the discovery of ZTF20abwysqy (AT2020scz), a fast-fading optical transient in the Fermi satellite and the Interplanetary Network localization regions of GRB 200826A; X-ray and radio emission further confirm that this is the afterglow. Follow-up imaging (at rest-frame 16.5 days) reveals excess emission above the afterglow that cannot be explained as an underlying kilonova, but which is consistent with being the supernova. Although the GRB duration is short (rest-frame T<SUB>90</SUB> of 0.65 s), our panchromatic follow-up data confirm a collapsar origin. GRB 200826A is the shortest LGRB found with an associated collapsar; it appears to sit on the brink between a successful and a failed collapsar. Our discovery is consistent with the hypothesis that most collapsars fail to produce ultra-relativistic jets.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatAs...5..917A,[]
A peculiarly short-duration gamma-ray burst from massive star core collapse,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been phenomenologically classified into long and short populations based on the observed bimodal distribution of duration<SUP>1</SUP>. Multi-wavelength and multi-messenger observations in recent years have revealed that in general long GRBs originate from massive star core collapse events<SUP>2</SUP>, whereas short GRBs originate from binary neutron star mergers<SUP>3</SUP>. It has been known that the duration criterion is sometimes unreliable, and multi-wavelength criteria are needed to identify the physical origin of a particular GRB<SUP>4</SUP>. Some apparently long GRBs have been suggested to have a neutron star merger origin<SUP>5</SUP>, whereas some apparently short GRBs have been attributed to genuinely long GRBs<SUP>6</SUP> whose short, bright emission is slightly above the detector's sensitivity threshold. Here, we report the comprehensive analysis of the multi-wavelength data of the short, bright GRB 200826A. Characterized by a sharp pulse, this burst shows a duration of 1 second and no evidence of an underlying longer-duration event. Its other observational properties such as its spectral behaviours, total energy and host galaxy offset are, however, inconsistent with those of other short GRBs believed to originate from binary neutron star mergers. Rather, these properties resemble those of long GRBs. This burst confirms the existence of short-duration GRBs with stellar core-collapse origin<SUP>4</SUP>, and presents some challenges to the existing models.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatAs...5..911Z,[]
Hierarchical mergers of stellar-mass black holes and their gravitational-wave signatures,"While most of the compact-binary mergers detected by LIGO and Virgo are expected to consist of first-generation black holes formed from the collapse of stars, others might instead be of second (or higher) generation, containing the remnants of previous black-hole mergers. We review theoretical findings, astrophysical modelling and current gravitational-wave evidence of hierarchical stellar-mass black-hole mergers. Such a subpopulation of hierarchically assembled black holes presents distinctive gravitational-wave signatures, namely higher masses, possibly within the pair-instability mass gap, and dimensionless spins clustered at the characteristic value of ~0.7. To produce hierarchical mergers, astrophysical environments need to overcome the relativistic recoils imparted to black-hole merger remnants, a condition that prefers hosts with escape speeds of ≳100 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>. Promising locations for efficient production of hierarchical mergers include nuclear star clusters and accretion disks surrounding active galactic nuclei, though environments that are less efficient at retaining merger products such as globular clusters may still contribute significantly to the detectable population of repeated mergers. While GW190521 is the single most promising hierarchical-merger candidate to date, constraints from large population analyses are becoming increasingly more powerful.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatAs...5..749G,[]
The observable supernova rate in galaxy-galaxy lensing systems with the TESS satellite,"The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is the latest observational effort to find exoplanets and map bright transient optical phenomena. Supernovae (SNe) are particularly interesting as cosmological standard candles for cosmological distance measures. The limiting magnitude of TESS strongly constrains SN detection to the very nearby Universe (m ~ 19, z < 0.05). We explore the possibility that more distant SNe that are gravitationally lensed and magnified by a foreground galaxy can be detected by TESS, an opportunity to measure the time delay between light paths and constrain the Hubble constant independently. We estimate the rate of occurrence of such systems, assuming reasonable distributions of magnification, host dust attenuation, and redshift. There are approximately 16 Type Ia SNe (SNIa) and 43 core-collapse SNe (SNcc) expected to be observable with TESS each year, which translates to 18 and 43 per cent chance of detection per year, respectively. Monitoring the largest collections of known strong galaxy-galaxy lenses from Petrillo et al., this translates into 0.6 and 1.3 per cent chances of an SNIa and an SNcc per year. The TESS all-sky detection rates are lower than those of the Zwicky Transient Facility and Vera Rubin Observatory. However, on the ecliptic poles, TESS performs almost as well as its all-sky search, thanks to its continuous coverage: 2 and 4 per cent chance of an observed SN (Ia or cc) each year. These rates argue for timely processing of full-frame TESS imaging to facilitate follow-up and should motivate further searches for low-redshift lensing system.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.1316H,[]
"Year 1 of the ZTF high-cadence Galactic plane survey: strategy, goals, and early results on new single-mode hot subdwarf B-star pulsators","We present the goals, strategy, and first results of the high-cadence Galactic plane survey using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The goal of the survey is to unveil the Galactic population of short-period variable stars, including short-period binaries, and stellar pulsators with periods less than a few hours. Between 2018 June and 2019 January, we observed 64 ZTF fields resulting in 2990 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of high stellar density in the ZTF-r band along the Galactic plane. Each field was observed continuously for 1.5 to 6 h with a cadence of 40 sec. Most fields have between 200 and 400 observations obtained over 2-3 continuous nights. As part of this survey, we extract a total of ≈230 million individual objects with at least 80 epochs obtained during the high-cadence Galactic plane survey reaching an average depth of ZTF-r ≈ 20.5 mag. For four selected fields with 2-10 million individual objects per field, we calculate different variability statistics and find that ≈1-2 per cent of the objects are astrophysically variable over the observed period. We present a progress report on recent discoveries, including a new class of compact pulsators, the first members of a new class of Roche lobe filling hot subdwarf binaries as well as new ultracompact double white dwarfs and flaring stars. Finally, we present a sample of 12 new single-mode hot subdwarf B-star pulsators with pulsation amplitudes between ZTF-r = 20-76 mmag and pulsation periods between P = 5.8-16 min with a strong cluster of systems with periods ≈6 min.

A novel bivariate autoregressive model for predicting and forecasting irregularly observed time series,"In several disciplines, it is common to find time series measured at irregular observational times. In particular, in astronomy there are a large number of surveys that gather information over irregular time gaps and in more than one passband. Some examples are Pan-STARRS, ZTF, and also the LSST. However, current commonly used time series models that estimate the time dependence in astronomical light curves consider the information of each band separately (e.g, CIAR, IAR, and CARMA models) disregarding the dependence that might exist between different passbands. In this paper, we propose a novel bivariate model for irregularly sampled time series, called the Bivariate Irregular Autoregressive (BIAR) model. The BIAR model assumes an autoregressive structure on each time series; it is stationary, and it allows to estimate the autocorrelation, the cross-correlation and the contemporary correlation between two unequally spaced time series. We implemented the BIAR model on light curves, in the g and r bands, obtained from the ZTF alerts processed by the ALeRCE broker. We show that if the light curves of the two bands are highly correlated, the model has more accurate forecast and prediction using the bivariate model than a similar method that uses only univariate information. Further, the estimated parameters of the BIAR are useful to characterize long-period variable stars and to distinguish between classes of stochastic objects, providing promising features that can be used for classification purposes.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505.1105E,[]
The outburst of a 60 min AM CVn reveals peculiar colour evolution: implications for outbursts in long-period double white dwarfs,"We report on multiwavelength observations during quiescence and of the first detected outburst of the ≈60 min orbital period AM CVn SDSS J113732+405458. Using X-ray and UV observations, we determined an upper limit duration of the event of about 1 yr. The amplitude of the outburst was remarkably small, of around 1 mag in r and 0.5 mag in g. We have also investigated the colour variations of SDSS J113732+405458 and other long-period AM CVns in outbursts and identified a track on the colour-magnitude diagram that is not compatible with the predictions of the disc instability model, suggesting that some outbursts in long-period AM CVns are caused by enhanced mass-transfer. To our knowledge, these are the first studies of the colour evolution in AM CVns. During quiescence we measured an X-ray luminosity for SDSS J113732+405458 of ≈3 × 10<SUP>29</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> in the 0.5-10 keV band. This indicates a very low accretion rate, in agreement with the disc instability model for long-period systems. However, such a model predicts stable discs at somewhat long periods. The discovery of this system outburst, along with similarities to the long-period system SDSS J080710+485259 with a comparably long, weak outburst, indicates that these enhanced mass-transfer events may be more common in long-period AM CVns. A larger sample would be needed to determine empirically at what period, if any, the disc instability stops functioning entirely. Finally, we identified an infrared excess in the quiescence spectrum attributable to the donor. This makes SDSS J113732+405458 the second AM CVn to have a directly detected donor.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.505..215R,[]
Correlated time variability of multicomponent high-velocity outflows in J162122.54+075808.4,"We present a detailed analysis of time variability of two distinct C IV broad absorption line (BAL) components seen in the spectrum of J162122.54+075808.4 (z<SUB>em</SUB> = 2.1394) using observations from SDSS, NTT, and SALT taken at seven different epochs spanning about 15 yr. The blue-BAL component (with an ejection velocity, $v_{\rm e}\sim 37\, 500$ km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) is an emerging absorption that shows equivalent width variations and kinematic shifts consistent with acceleration. The red-BAL component ($v_{\rm e} \sim 15\, 400$ km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) is a three-component absorption. One of the components is emerging and subsequently disappearing. The two other components show kinematic shifts consistent with acceleration coupled with equivalent width variability. Interestingly, we find the kinematic shifts and equivalent width variability of the blue- and red-BAL components to be correlated. While the C IV emission-line flux varies by more than 17 per cent during our monitoring period, the available light curves (covering rest frame 1300-2300 Å) do not show more than a 0.1 mag variability in the continuum. This suggests that the variations in the ionizing flux are larger than that of the near-ultraviolet flux. However, the correlated variability seen between different BAL components cannot be explained solely by photoionization models without structural changes. In the framework of disc wind models, any changes in the radial profiles of density and/or velocity triggered either by disc instabilities or by changes in the ionizing radiation can explain our observations. High-resolution spectroscopic monitoring of J1621+0758 is important to understand the physical conditions of the absorbing gas and thereby to constrain the parameters of disc wind models.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.5975A,[]
Double common envelope jets supernovae (CEJSNe) by triple-star systems,"I propose a new type of common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) events where instead of a single neutron star (NS; or a black hole; BH) a tight binary system of an NS and a main-sequence star enters a common envelope evolution (CEE) with a red supergiant. The NS and the main-sequence star of the tight binary system merge inside the red supergiant envelope and enter a CEE of their own. The NS accretes some mass through an accretion disc and launches jets that explodes the main-sequence star. I estimate that the two jets that the NS launches at this phase carry an energy of $\approx 10^{52} {~\rm erg}$, about the same order of magnitude as the energy that the jets will carry when the NS or its BH remnant will enter the core in a later phase. For that, I term the entire event a double CEJSN. The outcome of the double CEJSN is a very long, months to years, and very energetic event, a total energy of $\approx 10^{52} \!-\! 10^{53} {~\rm erg}$, that will be observationally classified as a peculiar superenergetic event. I crudely estimate that new transient surveys should detect about one CEJSN event from a triple-star system per year.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.5967S,[]
Search for dormant black holes in ellipsoidal variables - III. The OGLE BULGE short-period sample,"This is the third of a series of papers that presents an algorithm to search for close binaries with massive, possibly compact, unseen secondaries. The detection of such a binary is based on identifying a star that displays a large ellipsoidal periodic modulation, induced by tidal interaction with its companion. In the second paper of the series, we presented a simple approach to derive a robust modified minimum mass ratio (mMMR), based on the observed ellipsoidal amplitude, without knowing the primary mass and radius, assuming the primary fills its Roche lobe. The newly defined mMMR is always smaller than the actual mass ratio. Therefore, a binary with an mMMR larger than unity is a good candidate for having a massive secondary, which might be a black hole or a neutron star. This paper considers 10 956 OGLE short-period ellipsoidals observed towards the Galactic bulge. We re-analyse their modulation and identify 136 main-sequence systems with mMMR significantly larger than unity as candidates for having compact-object secondaries, assuming their observed periodic modulations reflect indeed the ellipsoidal effect. Obviously, one needs follow-up observations to find out the true nature of these companions.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.5907G,[]
The double-peaked Type Ic supernova 2019cad: another SN 2005bf-like object,"We present the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of supernova (SN) 2019cad during the first ~100 d from explosion. Based on the light-curve morphology, we find that SN 2019cad resembles the double-peaked Type Ib/c SN 2005bf and the Type Ic PTF11mnb. Unlike those two objects, SN 2019cad also shows the initial peak in the redder bands. Inspection of the g-band light curve indicates the initial peak is reached in ~8 d, while the r-band peak occurred ~15 d post-explosion. A second and more prominent peak is reached in all bands at ~45 d past explosion, followed by a fast decline from ~60 d. During the first 30 d, the spectra of SN 2019cad show the typical features of a Type Ic SN, however, after 40 d, a blue continuum with prominent lines of Si II λ6355 and C II λ6580 is observed again. Comparing the bolometric light curve to hydrodynamical models, we find that SN 2019cad is consistent with a pre-SN mass of 11 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and an explosion energy of 3.5 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg. The light-curve morphology can be reproduced either by a double-peaked <SUP>56</SUP>Ni distribution with an external component of 0.041 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and an internal component of 0.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> or a double-peaked <SUP>56</SUP>Ni distribution plus magnetar model (P ~ 11 ms and B ~ 26 × 10<SUP>14</SUP> G). If SN 2019cad were to suffer from significant host reddening (which cannot be ruled out), the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni model would require extreme values, while the magnetar model would still be feasible.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.4907G,[]
Galactic open cluster Cepheids - a census based on Gaia EDR3,"In the Gaia era, the membership analysis and parameter determination of open clusters (OCs) are more accurate.

"PyTorchDIA: a flexible, GPU-accelerated numerical approach to Difference Image Analysis","We present a GPU-accelerated numerical approach for fast kernel and differential background solutions. The model image proposed in the Bramich Difference Image Analysis (DIA) algorithm is analogous to a very simple convolutional neural network (CNN), with a single convolutional filter (i.e. the kernel) and an added scalar bias (i.e. the differential background). Here, we do not solve for the discrete pixel array in the classical, analytical linear least-squares sense. Instead, by making use of PyTorch tensors (GPU compatible multidimensional matrices) and associated deep learning tools, we solve for the kernel via an inherently massively parallel optimization. By casting the DIA problem as a GPU-accelerated optimization that utilizes automatic differentiation tools, our algorithm is both flexible to the choice of scalar objective function, and can perform DIA on astronomical data sets at least an order of magnitude faster than its classical analogue. More generally, we demonstrate that tools developed for machine learning can be used to address generic data analysis and modelling problems.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.3561H,[]
On the role of resonances in polluting white dwarfs by asteroids,"Pollution of white dwarf atmospheres may be caused by asteroids that originate from the locations of secular and mean-motion resonances in planetary systems. Asteroids in these locations experience increased eccentricity, leading to tidal disruption by the white dwarf. We examine how the ν<SUB>6</SUB> secular resonance shifts outwards into a previously stable region of the asteroid belt, as the star evolves to a white dwarf. Analytic secular models require a planet to be engulfed in order to shift the resonance. We show with numerical simulations that as a planet gets engulfed by the evolving star, the secular resonance shifts and the rate of tidal disruption events increases with the engulfed planet's mass and its orbital separation. We also investigate the behaviour of mean-motion resonances. The width of a mean-motion resonance increases as the star loses mass and becomes a white dwarf. The ν<SUB>6</SUB> secular resonance is more efficient at driving tidal disruptions than mean-motion resonances with Jupiter. By examining 230 observed exoplanetary systems whose central star will evolve into a white dwarf, we find that along with an Earth mass planet at $1\, \rm au$, hot Jupiters at a semimajor axis $arsim 0.05\, \rm au$ and super-Earths of mass $10\, \rm M_\oplus$ at $arsim 0.3\, \rm au$ represent planet types whose engulfment shifts resonances enough to cause pollution of the white dwarfs to a degree in agreement with observations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.3375S,[]
In the realm of the Hubble tension-a review of solutions,"The simplest ΛCDM model provides a good fit to a large span of cosmological data but harbors large areas of phenomenology and ignorance. With the improvement of the number and the accuracy of observations, discrepancies among key cosmological parameters of the model have emerged. The most statistically significant tension is the 4σ to 6σ disagreement between predictions of the Hubble constant, H <SUB>0</SUB>, made by the early time probes in concert with the 'vanilla' ΛCDM cosmological model, and a number of late time, model-independent determinations of H <SUB>0</SUB> from local measurements of distances and redshifts. The high precision and consistency of the data at both ends present strong challenges to the possible solution space and demands a hypothesis with enough rigor to explain multiple observations-whether these invoke new physics, unexpected large-scale structures or multiple, unrelated errors. A thorough review of the problem including a discussion of recent Hubble constant estimates and a summary of the proposed theoretical solutions is presented here. We include more than 1000 references, indicating that the interest in this area has grown considerably just during the last few years. We classify the many proposals to resolve the tension in these categories: early dark energy, late dark energy, dark energy models with 6 degrees of freedom and their extensions, models with extra relativistic degrees of freedom, models with extra interactions, unified cosmologies, modified gravity, inflationary models, modified recombination history, physics of the critical phenomena, and alternative proposals. Some are formally successful, improving the fit to the data in light of their additional degrees of freedom, restoring agreement within 1-2σ between Planck 2018, using the cosmic microwave background power spectra data, baryon acoustic oscillations, Pantheon SN data, and R20, the latest SH0ES Team Riess, et al (2021 Astrophys. J. 908 L6) measurement of the Hubble constant (H <SUB>0</SUB> = 73.2 ± 1.3 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> at 68% confidence level). However, there are many more unsuccessful models which leave the discrepancy well above the 3σ disagreement level. In many cases, reduced tension comes not simply from a change in the value of H <SUB>0</SUB> but also due to an increase in its uncertainty due to degeneracy with additional physics, complicating the picture and pointing to the need for additional probes. While no specific proposal makes a strong case for being highly likely or far better than all others, solutions involving early or dynamical dark energy, neutrino interactions, interacting cosmologies, primordial magnetic fields, and modified gravity provide the best options until a better alternative comes along. * In honor of the seminal work by E Hubble []",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021CQGra..38o3001D,[]
On the Binary Neutron Star Post-merger Magnetar Origin of XRT 210423,"XRT 201423 is an X-ray transient with a nearly flat plateau lasting 4.1 ks followed by a steep decay. This feature indicates that it might come from a magnetar formed through a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, similar to CDF-S XT2 and as predicted as a type of electromagnetic counterpart of BNS mergers. We test the compliance of the data with this model and use the observed duration and flux of the X-ray signal as well as upper limits of optical emission to pose constraints on the parameters of the underlying putative magnetar. Both the free zone and trapped zone geometric configurations are considered. We find that the data are generally consistent with such a model. The surface dipolar magnetic field and the ellipticity of the magnetar should satisfy B<SUB>p</SUB> < 7 × 10<SUP>14</SUP>G (B<SUB>p</SUB> < 4.9 × 10<SUP>14</SUP>G) and ϵ < 1.5 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> (ϵ < 1.1 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP>) under free zone (trapped zone) configurations, respectively. An upper limit on the distance (e.g., z < 0.55 with η<SUB>x</SUB> = 10<SUP>-4</SUP> or z < 3.5 with η<SUB>x</SUB> = 10<SUP>-2</SUP>) can be derived from the X-ray data, which depends on the X-ray dissipation efficiency η<SUB>x</SUB> of the spin-down luminosity. The nondetection of an optical counterpart places a conservative lower limit on the distance of the source, i.e., z > 0.045 regardless of the geometric configuration.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...915L..11A,[]
The Exotic Type Ic Broad-lined Supernova SN 2018gep: Blurring the Line between Supernovae and Fast Optical Transients,"In the last decade a number of rapidly evolving transients have been discovered that are not easily explained by traditional supernova models. We present optical and UV data on one such object, SN 2018gep, that displayed a fast rise with a mostly featureless blue continuum around peak, and evolved to develop broad features typical of an SN Ic-bl while retaining significant amounts of blue flux throughout its observations. This blue excess is most evident in its near-UV flux, which is over 4 mag brighter than other stripped-envelope supernovae, and is still visible in optical g-r colors. Its fast rise time of t<SUB>rise,V</SUB> = 5.6 ± 0.5 days puts it squarely in the emerging class of Fast Evolving Luminous Transients, or Fast Blue Optical Transients. With a peak absolute magnitude of M<SUB>v</SUB> = -19.53 ± 0.23 mag it is on the extreme end of both the rise time and peak magnitude distribution for SNe Ic-bl. These observations are consistent with a simple SN Ic-bl model that has an additional form of energy injection at early times that drives the observed rapid, blue rise. We show that SN 2018gep and the literature SN iPTF16asu have similar photometric and spectroscopic properties and that they overall share many similarities with both SNe Ic-bl and Fast Evolving Transients. Based on our SN 2018gep host galaxy data we derive a number of properties, and we show that the derived host galaxy properties for both SN 2018gep and iPTF16asu are consistent with the SNe Ic-bl and gamma-ray burst/supernova sample while being on the extreme edge of the observed Fast Evolving Transient sample.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...915..121P,[]
Fast Blue Optical Transients Due to Circumstellar Interaction and the Mysterious Supernova SN 2018gep,"The discovery of SN 2018gep (ZTF 18abukavn) challenged our understanding of the late-phase evolution of massive stars and their supernovae (SNe). The fast rise in luminosity of this SN (spectroscopically classified as a broad-lined Type Ic SN) indicates that the ejecta interacts with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM), while an additional energy source such as <SUP>56</SUP>Ni decay is required to explain the late-time light curve. These features hint at the explosion of a massive star with pre-SN mass loss. In this work, we examine the physical origins of rapidly evolving astrophysical transients like SN 2018gep. We investigate the wave-driven mass-loss mechanism and how it depends on model parameters such as progenitor mass and deposition energy, searching for stellar progenitor models that can reproduce the observational data. A model with an ejecta mass ~2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, explosion energy ~10<SUP>52</SUP> erg, a CSM of mass ~0.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and radius ~1000 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and a <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass ~0.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> provides a good fit to the bolometric light curve. We also examine how interaction-powered light curves depend more generally on these parameters and how ejecta velocities can help break degeneracies. We find both wave-driven mass loss and mass ejection via pulsational pair instability can plausibly create the dense CSM in SN 2018gep, but we favor the latter possibility.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...915...80L,[]

The challenge is that the datasets are so large that most data will never be seen by human eyes; currently the most robust instrument we have to detect relevant anomalies. Machine learning is a useful tool for anomaly detection in this regime. However, it struggles to distinguish between interesting anomalies and irrelevant data such as instrumental artefacts or rare astronomical sources that are simply not of interest to a particular scientist. Active learning combines the flexibility and intuition of the human brain with the raw processing power of machine learning. By strategically choosing specific objects for expert labelling, it minimises the amount of data that scientists have to look through while maximising potential scientific return. Here we introduce ASTRONOMALY: a general anomaly detection framework with a novel active learning approach designed to provide personalised recommendations. ASTRONOMALY can operate on most types of astronomical data, including images, light curves and spectra. We use the Galaxy Zoo dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of ASTRONOMALY, as well as simulated data to thoroughly test our new active learning approach. We find that for both datasets, ASTRONOMALY roughly doubles the number of interesting anomalies found in the first 100 objects viewed by the user. ASTRONOMALY is easily extendable to include new feature extraction techniques, anomaly detection algorithms and even different active learning approaches. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MichelleLochner/astronomaly.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&C....3600481L,[]
Fast period searches using the Lomb-Scargle algorithm on Graphics Processing Units for large datasets and real-time applications,"Computing the periods of variable objects is well-known to be computationally expensive. Modern astronomical catalogs contain a significant number of observed objects. Therefore, even if the period ranges for particular classes of objects are well-constrained due to expected physical properties, periods must be derived for a tremendous number of objects. In this paper, we propose a GPU-accelerated Lomb-Scargle period finding algorithm that computes periods for single objects or for batches of objects as is necessary in many data processing pipelines. We demonstrate the performance of several optimizations, including comparing the use of shared and global memory GPU kernels and using multiple CUDA streams to copy periodogram data from the GPU to the host. Also, we quantify the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit floating point precision on two classes of GPUs, and show that the performance degradation of using 64-bit over 32-bit is greater on the CPU than a GPU designed for scientific computing. We find that the GPU algorithm achieves superior performance over the baseline parallel CPU implementation, achieving a speedup of up to 174.53 ×. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will carry out the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We perform an analysis that shows we can derive the rotation periods of batches of Solar System objects at LSST scale in near real-time, which will be employed in a future LSST event broker.

HiSS-Cube: A scalable framework for Hierarchical Semi-Sparse Cubes preserving uncertainties,"A wide variety of approaches are available for big data cube visualization and analysis. However, few exploit the power of array databases and none preserve the scientific uncertainties in measurements when constructing lower resolutions. In machine learning applications, we often need to rapidly search data for regions of interest and then focus on these areas, but without having to retrain the model every time we change the resolution. However, the reliable verification of these areas also requires details of the accuracy of the measured values. In this study, we developed a new software infrastructure called Hierarchical Semi-Sparse Cube (HiSS-Cube) based on Hierarchical Data Format version 5. HiSS-Cube enables visualization and machine learning using combined heterogeneous data and it was designed to be scalable for big data. HiSS-Cube allows data from multiple domains (imaging, spectral, and time-series data) to be combined and the construction of a multi-resolution semi-sparse data cube that preserves the uncertainties of scientific measurement at all resolutions. The functionality of HiSS-Cube was verified based on a subset of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 survey. We compared the times and volumes for visualizations and machine learning data exported to HiSS-Cube and the original format (FITS). Using these data, we demonstrated that HiSS-Cube is faster by several orders of magnitude. HiSS-Cube supports export to the VOTable format and it is compatible with common Virtual Observatory tools. The source code for our prototype HiSS-Cube is available from GitHub and the data are available from Zenodo.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&C....3600463N,[]
A CHEOPS white dwarf transit search,"White dwarf spectroscopy shows that nearly half of white dwarf atmospheres contain metals that must have been accreted from planetary material that survived the red giant phases of stellar evolution. We can use metal pollution in white dwarf atmospheres as flags, signalling recent accretion, in order to prioritize an efficient sample of white dwarfs to search for transiting material. We present a search for planetesimals orbiting six nearby white dwarfs with the CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS). The targets are relatively faint for CHEOPS, 11 mag < G < 12.8 mag. We used aperture photometry data products from the CHEOPS mission as well as custom point-spread function photometry to search for periodic variations in flux due to transiting planetesimals. We detect no significant variations in flux that cannot be attributed to spacecraft systematics, despite reaching a photometric precision of < 2 ppt in 60 s exposures on each target. We simulate observations to show that the small survey is sensitive primarily to Moon-sized transiting objects with periods between 3 h < P < 10 h, with radii of R ≳ 1000 km.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...651L..12M,[]
Galactic spiral structure revealed by Gaia EDR3,"Using the astrometry and integrated photometry from the Gaia Early Data Release 3, we map the density variations in the distribution of young upper main sequence (UMS) stars, open clusters, and classical Cepheids in the Galactic disc within several kiloparsecs of the Sun. We derive maps of relative over- and under-dense regions for UMS stars in the Galactic disc using both bivariate kernel density estimators and wavelet transformations. The resulting overdensity maps exhibit large-scale arches that extend in a clumpy but coherent way over the entire sampled volume, indicating the location of the spiral arm segments in the vicinity of the Sun. Peaks in the UMS overdensity are well matched by the distribution of young and intrinsically bright open clusters. By applying a wavelet transformation to a sample of classical Cepheids, we find that their overdensities possibly extend the spiral arm segments on a larger scale (≃10 kpc from the Sun). While the resulting map based on the UMS sample is generally consistent with previous models of the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm, the geometry of the arms in the III quadrant (galactic longitudes 180° < l < 270°) differs significantly from that suggested by many previous models. In particular, we find that our maps favour a larger pitch angle for the Perseus arm, and that the Local Arm extends into the III quadrant at least 4 kpc past the position of the Sun, giving it a total length of at least 8 kpc.",,[]

Prospects for kilonova signals in the gravitational-wave era,"The binary neutron star merger gravitational-wave signal GW170817 was followed by three electromagnetic counterparts, including a kilonova arising from the radioactivity of freshly synthesized r-process elements in ejecta from the merger. Finding kilonovae after gravitational-wave triggers is crucial for (i) the search for further counterparts, such as the afterglow, (ii) probing the diversity of kilonovae and their dependence on the system's inclination angle, and (iii) building a sample for multi-messenger cosmology. During the third observing run of the gravitational-wave interferometer network, no kilonova counterpart was found. We aim to predict the expected population of detectable kilonova signals for the upcoming O4 and O5 observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA instruments. Using a simplified criterion for gravitational-wave detection and a simple GW170817-calibrated model for the kilonova peak magnitude, we determine the rate of kilonovae in reach of follow-up campaigns and their distributions in magnitude for various bands. We briefly consider the case of GW190425, the only binary neutron star merger confirmed since GW170817, and obtain constraints on its inclination angle from the non-detection of its kilonova, assuming the source was below the follow-up thresholds. We also show that non-gravitational-wave-triggered kilonovae can be a numerous class of sources in future surveys and briefly discuss associations with short bright gamma-ray bursts. We finally discuss the detection of the jetted outflow afterglow in addition to the kilonova.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...651A..83M,[]
Type Ic supernovae from the (intermediate) Palomar Transient Factory,"Context.

"Aims: We present an analysis of 44 spectroscopically normal Type Ic supernovae, with focus on the light curves. The photometric data were obtained over 7 years with the Palomar Transient Factory and its continuation, the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory. This is the first homogeneous and large sample of SNe Ic from an untargeted survey, and we aim to estimate explosion parameters for the sample.",,,[]
"Methods: We present K-corrected Bgriz light curves of these SNe, obtained through photometry on template-subtracted images.

Peak r-band absolute magnitudes have an average of −17.71 ± 0.85 mag. To derive the explosion epochs, we fit the r-band lightcurves to a template derived from a well-sampled light curve. We computed the bolometric light curves using r and g band data, g − r colors and bolometric corrections. Bolometric light curves and Fe II λ5169 velocities at peak were used to fit to the Arnett semianalytic model in order to estimate the ejecta mass M<SUB>ej</SUB>, the explosion energy E<SUB>K</SUB> and the mass of radioactive nickel M(<SUP>56</SUP>Ni) for each SN.",,,[]

Removing Atmospheric Fringes from Zwicky Transient Facility i-band Images using Principal Component Analysis,"The Zwicky Transient Facility is a time-domain optical survey that has substantially increased our ability to observe and construct massive catalogs of astronomical objects by use of its 47 square degree camera that can observe in multiple filters. However the telescope's i-band filter suffers from significant atmospheric fringes that reduce photometric precision, especially for faint sources and in multi-epoch co-additions. Here we present a method for constructing models of these atmospheric fringes using Principal Component Analysis that can be used to identify and remove these artifacts from contaminated images. In addition, we present the Uniform Background Indicator as a quantitative measurement of the reduced correlated background noise and photometric error present after removing fringes. We conclude by evaluating the effect of our method on measuring faint sources through the injection and recovery of artificial stars in both single-image epochs and co-additions. Our method for constructing atmospheric fringe models and applying those models to produce cleaned images is available for public download in the open source Python package fringez (https://github.com/MichaelMedford/fringez).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASP..133f4503M,[]
Spectroscopic and photometric observations of dwarf nova superoutbursts by the 3.8 m telescope Seimei and the Variable Star Network,"We present spectroscopic and photometric observations of 17 dwarf-nova superoutbursts obtained by KOOLS-IFU mounted on the 3.8 m telescope Seimei at the Okayama Observatory of Kyoto University and through the Variable Star Network collaboration (VSNET). Our spectroscopic observations for six outbursts were performed within 1 d of their optical peak. 11 objects (TCP J00590972+3438357, ASASSN-19ado, TCP J06073081-0101501, ZTF20aavnpug, ASASSN-19ady, MASTER OT J061642.05+435617.9, TCP J20034647+1335125, ASASSN-20kv, ASASSN-20kw, MASTER OT J213908.79+161240.2, and ASASSN-20mf) were previously unknown systems, and our observations enabled quick classification of their transient type. These results illustrate that the Seimei telescope has the capability to conduct quick follow-up observations of unknown transients. Our photometric observations yielded that 11 of the objects are WZ Sge-type dwarf novae and their candidates, and the other six are SU UMa-type dwarf novae and their candidates. The He II 4686 Å emission line was clearly detected among ASASSN-19ado, TCP J06073081-0101501 and MASTER OT J213908.79+161240.2, the association of which with a spiral arm structure in an accretion disk has been suggested in previous studies.

Processing GOTO survey data with the Rubin Observatory LSST Science Pipelines II: Forced Photometry and lightcurves,"We have adapted the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Science Pipelines to process data from the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) prototype. In this paper, we describe how we used the LSST Science Pipelines to conduct forced photometry measurements on nightly GOTO data. By comparing the photometry measurements of sources taken on multiple nights, we find that the precision of our photometry is typically better than 20 mmag for sources brighter than 16 mag. We also compare our photometry measurements against colour-corrected Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System photometry and find that the two agree to within 10 mmag (1 $σ$ ) for bright (i.e., $∼ 14th mag$ ) sources to 200 mmag for faint (i.e., $∼ 18th mag$ ) sources. Additionally, we compare our results to those obtained by GOTO's own in-house pipeline, GOTOPHOTO, and obtain similar results. Based on repeatability measurements, we measure a $5σ$ L-band survey depth of between 19 and 20 magnitudes, depending on observing conditions. We assess, using repeated observations of non-varying standard Sloan Digital Sky Survey stars, the accuracy of our uncertainties, which we find are typically overestimated by roughly a factor of two for bright sources (i.e., $< 15th mag$ ), but slightly underestimated (by roughly a factor of 1.25) for fainter sources ( $> 17th mag$ ). Finally, we present lightcurves for a selection of variable sources and compare them to those obtained with the Zwicky Transient Factory and GAIA. Despite the LSST Software Pipelines still undergoing active development, our results show that they are already delivering robust forced photometry measurements from GOTO data.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASA...38...25M,[]

Gamma-ray burst jets in supernovae,"We review the current observational status and theoretical interpretations for the class of broad lines type Ic supernovae. They are characterized by fast photospheric expansion and lack of H and He absorption. They have a larger than normal energy budget, suggesting that they are powered or, at least, augmented by a central engine, like a magnetar or an accreting black hole. There appears therefore to be a link between these supernovae and long-duration gamma-ray bursts. However, its nature has not been satisfactorily demystified.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NewAR..9201614C,[]
A highly magnetized and rapidly rotating white dwarf as small as the Moon,"White dwarfs represent the last stage of evolution of stars with mass less than about eight times that of the Sun and, like other stars, are often found in binaries<SUP>1,2</SUP>. If the orbital period of the binary is short enough, energy losses from gravitational-wave radiation can shrink the orbit until the two white dwarfs come into contact and merge<SUP>3</SUP>. Depending on the component masses, the merger can lead to a supernova of type Ia or result in a massive white dwarf<SUP>4</SUP>. In the latter case, the white dwarf remnant is expected to be highly magnetized<SUP>5,6</SUP> because of the strong magnetic dynamo that should arise during the merger, and be rapidly spinning from the conservation of the orbital angular momentum<SUP>7</SUP>. Here we report observations of a white dwarf, ZTF J190132.9+145808.7, that exhibits these properties, but to an extreme: a rotation period of 6.94 minutes, a magnetic field ranging between 600 megagauss and 900 megagauss over its surface, and a stellar radius of 2140<SUB>−230</SUB><SUP>+160</SUP>? kilometres, only slightly larger than the radius of the Moon. Such a small radius implies that the star's mass is close to the maximum white dwarf mass, or Chandrasekhar mass. ZTF J190132.9+145808.7 is likely to be cooling through the Urca processes (neutrino emission from electron capture on sodium) because of the high densities reached in its core.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021Natur.595...39C,[]
Infrared spectropolarimetric detection of intrinsic polarization from a core-collapse supernova,"Massive stars die an explosive death as a core-collapse supernova (CCSN). The exact physical processes that cause the collapsing star to rebound into an explosion are not well understood<SUP>1-3</SUP>, and the key to resolving this issue may lie in the measurement of the shape of CCSNe ejecta. Spectropolarimetry is the only way to perform this measurement for CCSNe outside the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. We present the infrared spectropolarimetric detection of a CCSN enabled by the new highly sensitive WIRC+Pol instrument at Palomar Observatory, which can observe CCSNe (magnitude M = −17 mag) out to 20 Mpc at ~0.1% polarimetric precision. Infrared spectropolarimetry is less affected than optical spectropolarimetry by dust scattering in the circumstellar and interstellar media, thereby providing a less biased probe of the intrinsic geometry of the supernova ejecta. SN 2018hna, a SN 1987A-like explosion, shows 2.0 ± 0.3% continuum polarization in the J band oriented at ~160° on sky 182 days after the explosion. Assuming a prolate geometry as in SN 1987A, we infer an ejecta axis ratio of <0.48 with the axis of symmetry pointing at a 70° position angle. The axis ratio is similar to that of SN 1987A, suggesting that the two CCSNe may share intrinsic geometry and inclination angles. Our data do not rule out oblate ejecta. We also observe one other CCSN and two thermonuclear supernovae in the J band. Supernova 2020oi, a stripped-envelope type Ic SN in Messier 100 has broadband p = 0.37 ± 0.09% at peak light, indicative of either a 10% asymmetry or host interstellar polarization. The type Ia SNe 2019ein and 2020ue have <0.33% and <1.08% polarization near peak light, indicative of asymmetries of less than 10% and 20%, respectively.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatAs...5..544T,[]
Optimizing serendipitous detections of kilonovae: cadence and filter selection,"The rise of multimessenger astronomy has brought with it the need to exploit all available data streams and learn more about the astrophysical objects that fall within its breadth. One possible avenue is the search for serendipitous optical/near-infrared counterparts of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and gravitational-wave (GW) signals, known as kilonovae. With surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which observes the sky with a cadence of ~3 d, the existing counterpart locations are likely to be observed; however, due to the significant amount of sky to explore, it is difficult to search for these fast-evolving candidates. Thus, it is beneficial to optimize the survey cadence for realtime kilonova identification and enable further photometric and spectroscopic observations. We explore how the cadence of wide field-of-view surveys like ZTF can be improved to facilitate such identifications. We show that with improved observational choices, e.g. the adoption of three epochs per night on a ~ nightly basis, and the prioritization of redder photometric bands, detection efficiencies improve by about a factor of two relative to the nominal cadence. We also provide realistic hypothetical constraints on the kilonova rate as a form of comparison between strategies, assuming that no kilonovae are detected throughout the long-term execution of the respective observing plan. These results demonstrate how an optimal use of ZTF increases the likelihood of kilonova discovery independent of GWs or GRBs, thereby allowing for a sensitive search with less interruption of its nominal cadence through Target of Opportunity programs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.2822A,[]
The first Hubble diagram and cosmological constraints using superluminous supernovae,"We present the first Hubble diagram of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) out to a redshift of two, together with constraints on the matter density, Ω<SUB>M</SUB>, and the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, w(≡p/ρ). We build a sample of 20 cosmologically useful SLSNe I based on light curve and spectroscopy quality cuts. We confirm the robustness of the peak-decline SLSN I standardization relation with a larger data set and improved fitting techniques than previous works. We then solve the SLSN model based on the above standardization via minimization of the χ<SUP>2</SUP> computed from a covariance matrix that includes statistical and systematic uncertainties. For a spatially flat Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model, we find $\Omega _{\rm M}=0.38^{+0.24}_{-0.19}$, with an rms of 0.27 mag for the residuals of the distance moduli. For a w<SUB>0</SUB>w<SUB>a</SUB>CDM cosmological model, the addition of SLSNe I to a 'baseline' measurement consisting of Planck temperature together with Type Ia supernovae, results in a small improvement in the constraints of w<SUB>0</SUB> and w<SUB>a</SUB> of 4 per cent. We present simulations of future surveys with 868 and 492 SLSNe I (depending on the configuration used) and show that such a sample can deliver cosmological constraints in a flat ΛCDM model with the same precision (considering only statistical uncertainties) as current surveys that use Type Ia supernovae, while providing a factor of 2-3 improvement in the precision of the constraints on the time variation of dark energy, w<SUB>0</SUB> and w<SUB>a</SUB>. This paper represents the proof of concept for superluminous supernova cosmology, and demonstrates they can provide an independent test of cosmology in the high-redshift (z > 1) universe.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.2535I,[]
Towards a volumetric census of close white dwarf binaries - I. Reference samples,"Close white dwarf binaries play an important role across a range of astrophysics, including thermonuclear supernovae, the Galactic low-frequency gravitational wave signal, and the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. Progress in developing a detailed understanding of the complex, multithreaded evolutionary pathways of these systems is limited by the lack of statistically sound observational constraints on the relative fractions of various sub-populations and their physical properties. The available samples are small, heterogeneous, and subject to a multitude of observational biases. Our overarching goal is to establish a volume-limited sample of all types of white dwarf binaries that is representative of the underlying population as well as sufficiently large to serve as a benchmark for future binary population models. In this first paper, we provide an overview of the project, and assemble reference samples within a distance limit of 300 pc of known white dwarf binaries spanning the most common sub-classes: post-common envelope binaries containing a white dwarf plus a main-sequence star, cataclysmic variables, and double-degenerate binaries. We carefully vet the members of these ""Gold"" samples, which span most of the evolutionary parameter space of close white dwarf binary evolution. We also explore the differences between magnitude and volume limited close white dwarf binary samples, and discuss how these systems evolve in their observational properties across the Gaia Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.2420I,[]
A cool and inflated progenitor candidate for the Type Ib supernova 2019yvr at 2.6 yr before explosion,"We present Hubble Space Telescope imaging of a pre-explosion counterpart to SN 2019yvr obtained 2.6 yr before its explosion as a type Ib supernova (SN Ib). Aligning to a post-explosion Gemini-S/GSAOI image, we demonstrate that there is a single source consistent with being the SN 2019yvr progenitor system, the second SN Ib progenitor candidate after iPTF13bvn. We also analysed pre-explosion Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) imaging, but we do not detect any counterparts at the SN location. SN 2019yvr was highly reddened, and comparing its spectra and photometry to those of other, less extinguished SNe Ib we derive $E(B-V)=0.51\substack{+0.27\\ -0.16}$ mag for SN 2019yvr. Correcting photometry of the pre-explosion source for dust reddening, we determine that this source is consistent with a log (L/L<SUB>⊙</SUB>) = 5.3 ± 0.2 and $T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 6800\substack{+400\\ -200}$ K star. This relatively cool photospheric temperature implies a radius of 320$\substack{+30\\ -50}~\mathrm{ R}_{\odot}$, much larger than expectations for SN Ib progenitor stars with trace amounts of hydrogen but in agreement with previously identified SN IIb progenitor systems. The photometry of the system is also consistent with binary star models that undergo common envelope evolution, leading to a primary star hydrogen envelope mass that is mostly depleted but still seemingly in conflict with the SN Ib classification of SN 2019yvr. SN 2019yvr had signatures of strong circumstellar interaction in late-time (>150 d) spectra and imaging, and so we consider eruptive mass-loss and common envelope evolution scenarios that explain the SN Ib spectroscopic class, pre-explosion counterpart, and dense circumstellar material. We also hypothesize that the apparent inflation could be caused by a quasi-photosphere formed in an extended, low-density envelope, or circumstellar matter around the primary star.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.2073K,[]
Detectability of kilonovae in optical surveys: post-mortem examination of the LVC O3 run follow-up,"The detection of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and the associated electromagnetic (EM) counterpart, the 'kilonova' (kN) AT2017gfo, opened a new era in multimessenger astronomy. However, despite many efforts, it has been proven very difficult to find additional kNe, even though LIGO/Virgo has reported at least one BNS event during their latest run, O3. The focus of this work is the exploration of the sensitivity of the adopted optical surveys searching for kNe during O3. We propose ways to optimize the choices of filters and survey depth to boost the detection efficiency for these faint and fast-evolving transients in the future. In particular, we use kN models to explore the dependence on ejecta mass, geometry, viewing angle, wavelength coverage, and source distance. We find that the kN detection efficiency has a strong viewing-angle dependence, especially for filters blueward of i-band. This loss of sensitivity can be mitigated by early, deep, observations. Efficient gri counterpart searches for kNe at ~200 Mpc would require reaching a limiting magnitude m<SUB>lim</SUB> = 23 mag, to ensure good sensitivity over a wide range of the model phase-space. We conclude that kN searches during O3 were generally too shallow to detect BNS optical counterparts, even under optimistic assumptions.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504.1294S,[]
Accretion disc cooling and narrow absorption lines in the tidal disruption event AT 2019dsg,"We present the results of a large multiwavelength follow-up campaign of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT 2019dsg, focusing on low to high resolution optical spectroscopy, X-ray, and radio observations. The galaxy hosts a super massive black hole of mass $\rm (5.4\pm 3.2)\times 10^6\, M_\odot$ and careful analysis finds no evidence for the presence of an active galactic nucleus, instead the TDE host galaxy shows narrow optical emission lines that likely arise from star formation activity. The transient is luminous in the X-rays, radio, UV, and optical. The X-ray emission becomes undetected after ~100 d, and the radio luminosity density starts to decay at frequencies above 5.4 GHz by ~160 d. Optical emission line signatures of the TDE are present up to ~200 d after the light-curve peak. The medium to high resolution spectra show traces of absorption lines that we propose originate in the self-gravitating debris streams. At late times, after ~200 d, narrow Fe lines appear in the spectra. The TDE was previously classified as N-strong, but after careful subtraction of the host galaxy's stellar contribution, we find no evidence for these N lines in the TDE spectrum, even though O Bowen lines are detected. The observed properties of the X-ray emission are fully consistent with the detection of the inner regions of a cooling accretion disc. The optical and radio properties are consistent with this central engine seen at a low inclination (i.e. seen from the poles).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504..792C,[]
On the AGN nature of broad balmer emission in four low-redshift metal-poor galaxies,"We report on continued, ~15-yr long, broad Balmer emission lines in three metal-poor dwarf emission-line galaxies selected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy. The persistent luminosity of the broad Balmer emission indicates the galaxies are active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with virial black hole masses of ~10<SUP>6.7</SUP>-10<SUP>7.0</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The lack of observed hard X-ray emission and the possibility that the Balmer emission could be due to a long-lived stellar transient motivated additional follow-up spectroscopy. We also identify a previously unreported blueshifted narrow absorption line in the broad H α feature in one of the AGNs, indicating an AGN-driven outflow with hydrogen column densities of order 10<SUP>17</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. We also extract light curves from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey and the Zwicky Transient Facility. We detect probable AGN-like variability in three galaxies, further supporting the AGN scenario. This also suggests the AGNs are not strongly obscured. This sample of galaxies are among the most metal-poor that host an AGN (Z = 0.05-0.16 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>). We speculate they may be analogues to seed black holes which formed in unevolved galaxies at high redshift. Given the rarity of metal-poor AGNs and small sample size available, we investigate prospects for their identification in future spectroscopic and photometric surveys.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504..543B,[]
Dipper-like variability of the Gaia alerted young star V555 Ori,"V555 Ori is a T Tauri star, whose 1.5 mag brightening was published as a Gaia science alert in 2017. We carried out optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometric, and optical spectroscopic observations to understand the light variations. The light curves show that V555 Ori was faint before 2017, entered a high state for about a year, and returned to the faint state by mid-2018. In addition to the long-term flux evolution, quasi-periodic brightness oscillations were also evident, with a period of about 5 d. At optical wavelengths both the long-term and short-term variations exhibited colourless changes, while in the NIR they were consistent with changing extinction. We explain the brightness variations as the consequence of changing extinction. The object has a low accretion rate whose variation in itself would not be enough to reproduce the optical flux changes. This behaviour makes V555 Ori similar to the pre-main sequence star AA Tau, where the light changes are interpreted as periodic eclipses of the star by a rotating inner disc warp. The brightness maximum of V555 Ori was a moderately obscured (A<SUB>V</SUB> = 2.3 mag) state, while the extinction in the low state was A<SUB>V</SUB> = 6.4 mag. We found that while the Gaia alert hinted at an accretion burst, V555 Ori is a standard dipper, similar to the prototype AA Tau. However, unlike in AA Tau, the periodic behaviour was also detectable in the faint phase, implying that the inner disc warp remained stable in both the high and low states of the system.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.504..185N,[]
No velocity-kicks are required to explain large-distance offsets of Ca-rich supernovae and short-GRBs,"Environments of supernovae (SNe) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) link their progenitors to the underlying stellar population, providing critical clues for their origins. However, various transients including Ca-rich SNe and short-GRBs, appear to be located at remote locations, far from the stellar population of their host galaxy, challenging our understanding of their origin and/or physical evolution. These findings instigated models suggesting that either large velocity-kicks were imparted to the transient progenitors, allowing them to propagate to large distances and attain their remote locations; or that they formed in dense globular-clusters residing in the haloes. Here we show that instead, large spatial-offsets of such transients are naturally explained by observations of highly extended stellar populations in (mostly early-type) galaxy haloes, typically missed since they can only be identified through ultra-deep/stacked images. Consequently, no large velocity kicks, nor halo globular-cluster environments are required in order to explain the origin of these transients. These findings support thermonuclear explosions on white-dwarfs, for the origins of Ca-rich SNe progenitors, and the existence of small (or zero) kick-velocities given to short-GRB progenitors. Furthermore, since stacked/ultra-deep imaging show that early-type galaxies are more extended than late-type galaxies, studies of transients' offset-distribution (e.g. type Ia SNe or FRBs) should account for host galaxy-type. Since early-type galaxies contain older stellar populations, transient arising from older stellar populations would have larger fractions of early-type hosts, and consequently larger fractions of large-offset transients. In agreement with our results for short-GRBs and Ca-rich SNe showing different offset distributions in early versus late-type galaxies.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.5997P,[]
Thermonuclear explosion of a massive hybrid HeCO white dwarf triggered by a He detonation on a companion,"Normal type Ia supernovae (SNe) are thought to arise from the thermonuclear explosion of massive (>0.8 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (WDs), although the exact mechanism is debated. In some models, helium accretion on to a carbon-oxygen (CO) WD from a companion was suggested to dynamically trigger a detonation of the accreted helium shell. The helium detonation then produces a shock that after converging on itself close to the core of the CO WD, triggers a secondary carbon detonation, and gives rise to an energetic explosion. However, most studies of such scenarios have been done in one or two dimensions, and/or did not consider self-consistent models for the accretion and the He donor. Here, we make use of detailed 3D simulation to study the interaction of a He-rich hybrid $0.69\, \mathrm{M_\odot }$ HeCO WD with a more massive $0.8\, \mathrm{M_\odot }$ CO WD. We find that accretion from the hybrid WD on to the CO WD gives rise to a helium detonation. However, the helium detonation does not trigger a carbon detonation in the CO WD. Instead, the helium detonation burns through the accretion stream to also burn the helium shell of the donor hybrid HeCO WD. The detonation of its massive helium shell then compresses its CO core, and triggers its detonation and full destruction. The explosion gives rise to a faint, likely highly reddened transient, potentially observable by the Vera Rubin survey, and the high-velocity ( $\sim \! 1000\, \mathrm{km s^{-1}}$ ) ejection of the heated surviving CO WD companion. Pending on uncertainties in stellar evolution, we estimate the rate of such transient to be up to $\sim \! 10{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the rate of type Ia SNe.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.4734P,[]
IceCube-Gen2: the window to the extreme Universe,"The observation of electromagnetic radiation from radio to γ-ray wavelengths has provided a wealth of information about the Universe. However, at PeV (10<SUP>15</SUP> eV) energies and above, most of the Universe is impenetrable to photons. New messengers, namely cosmic neutrinos, are needed to explore the most extreme environments of the Universe where black holes, neutron stars, and stellar explosions transform gravitational energy into non-thermal cosmic rays. These energetic particles have millions of times higher energies than those produced in the most powerful particle accelerators on Earth. As neutrinos can escape from regions otherwise opaque to radiation, they allow an unique view deep into exploding stars and the vicinity of the event horizons of black holes. The discovery of cosmic neutrinos with IceCube has opened this new window on the Universe. IceCube has been successful in finding first evidence for cosmic particle acceleration in the jet of an active galactic nucleus. Yet, ultimately, its sensitivity is too limited to detect even the brightest neutrino sources with high significance, or to detect populations of less luminous sources. In this white paper, we present an overview of a next-generation instrument, IceCube-Gen2, which will sharpen our understanding of the processes and environments that govern the Universe at the highest energies.

MeerCRAB: MeerLICHT classification of real and bogus transients using deep learning,"Astronomers require efficient automated detection and classification pipelines when conducting large-scale surveys of the (optical) sky for variable and transient sources. Such pipelines are fundamentally important, as they permit rapid follow-up and analysis of those detections most likely to be of scientific value. We therefore present a deep learning pipeline based on the convolutional neural network architecture called MeerCRAB. It is designed to filter out the so called ""bogus"" detections from true astrophysical sources in the transient detection pipeline of the MeerLICHT telescope. Optical candidates are described using a variety of 2D images and numerical features extracted from those images. The relationship between the input images and the target classes is unclear, since the ground truth is poorly defined and often the subject of debate. This makes it difficult to determine which source of information should be used to train a classification algorithm. We therefore used two methods for labelling our data (i) thresholding and (ii) latent class model approaches. We deployed variants of MeerCRAB that employed different network architectures trained using different combinations of input images and training set choices, based on classification labels provided by volunteers. The deepest network worked best with an accuracy of 99.5% and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value of 0.989. The best model was integrated to the MeerLICHT transient vetting pipeline, enabling the accurate and efficient classification of detected transients that allows researchers to select the most promising candidates for their research goals.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ExA...tmp...61H,[]
"MASTER OT J172758.09+380021.5: a peculiar ER UMa-type dwarf nova, probably a missed nova in the recent past","A CCD photometry of the dwarf nova MASTER OT J172758.09+380021.5 was carried out in 2019 during 134 nights. Observations covered three superoutbursts, five normal outbursts and quiescence between them. The available ASASSN and ZTF data for 2014 -- 2020 were also examined. Spectral observations were done in 2020 when the object was in quiescence. Spectra and photometry revealed that the star is an H-rich active ER UMa-type dwarf nova with a highly variable supercycle (time interval between two successive superoutbursts) of ∼ 50 -- 100 d that implies a high and variable mass-transfer rate. MASTER OT J172758.09+380021.5 demonstrated peculiar behaviour: short-lasted superoutbursts (a week); a slow superoutburst decline and cases of rebrightenings; low frequency (from none to a few) of the normal outbursts during the supercycle. In 2019 a mean period of positive superhumps was found to be 0.05829 d during the superoutbursts. Late superhumps with a mean period of 0.057915 d which lasted about ∼ 20 d after the end of superoutburst and were replaced by an orbital period of 0.057026 d or its orbital-negative superhump beat period were detected. An absence of eclipse in the orbital light curve and its moderate amplitude are consistent with the orbital inclination of about 40\degr found from spectroscopy. The blue peaks of the V-Ic and B-Rc colour indices of superhumps during the superoutburst coincided with minima of the light curves, while B-Rc of the late superhumps coincided with a rising branch of the light curves. We found that a low mass ratio q = 0.08 could explain most of the peculiarities of MASTER OT J172758.09+380021.5. The mass-transfer rate should be accordingly higher than what is expected from gravitational radiation only, this assumes the object is in a post-nova state and underwent a nova eruption relatively recently -- hundreds of years ago. This object would provide probably the first observational evidence that a nova eruption can occur even in CVs near the period minimum.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021CoSka..51..138P,[]

Performed multicolor CCD observations permit us to follow its fading from an outburst in August and an entire superoutburst in October 2020. The duration of the superoutburst is 13 days.

SPICY: The Spitzer/IRAC Candidate YSO Catalog for the Inner Galactic Midplane,"We present ∼120,000 Spitzer/IRAC candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) based on surveys of the Galactic midplane between ℓ ∼ 255° and 110°, including the GLIMPSE I, II, and 3D, Vela-Carina, Cygnus X, and SMOG surveys (613 square degrees), augmented by near-infrared catalogs. We employed a classification scheme that uses the flexibility of a tailored statistical learning method and curated YSO data sets to take full advantage of Spitzer's spatial resolution and sensitivity in the mid-infrared ∼3-9 μm range. Multiwavelength color/magnitude distributions provide intuition about how the classifier separates YSOs from other red IRAC sources and validate that the sample is consistent with expectations for disk/envelope-bearing pre-main-sequence stars. We also identify areas of IRAC color space associated with objects with strong silicate absorption or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission. Spatial distributions and variability properties help corroborate the youthful nature of our sample. Most of the candidates are in regions with mid-IR nebulosity, associated with star-forming clouds, but others appear distributed in the field. Using Gaia DR2 distance estimates, we find groups of YSO candidates associated with the Local Arm, the Sagittarius-Carina Arm, and the Scutum-Centaurus Arm. Candidate YSOs visible to the Zwicky Transient Facility tend to exhibit higher variability amplitudes than randomly selected field stars of the same magnitude, with many high-amplitude variables having light-curve morphologies characteristic of YSOs. Given that no current or planned instruments will significantly exceed IRAC's spatial resolution while possessing its wide-area mapping capabilities, Spitzer-based catalogs such as ours will remain the main resources for mid-infrared YSOs in the Galactic midplane for the near future.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..254...33K,[]
Do LIGO/Virgo Black Hole Mergers Produce AGN Flares? The Case of GW190521 and Prospects for Reaching a Confident Association,"The recent report of an association of the gravitational-wave (GW) binary black hole (BBH) merger GW190521 with a flare in the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) J124942.3 344929 has generated tremendous excitement. However, GW190521 has one of the largest localization volumes among all of the GW events detected so far. The 90 localization volume likely contains 7400 unobscured AGNs brighter than g 20.5 AB mag, and it results in a 70 probability of chance coincidence for an AGN flare consistent with the GW event. We present a Bayesian formalism to estimate the confidence of an AGN association by analyzing a population of BBH events with dedicated follow-up observations. Depending on the fraction of BBHs arising from AGNs, counterpart searches of ${ \mathcal O }(1)-{ \mathcal O }(100)$ GW events are needed to establish a confident association, and more than an order of magnitude more for searches without follow-up (i.e., using only the locations of AGN and GW events). Follow-up campaigns of the top 5 (based on volume localization and binary mass) of BBH events with total rest-frame mass 50 M are expected to establish a confident association during the next LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing run (O4), as long as the true value of the fraction of BBHs giving rise to AGN flares is >0.1. Our formalism allows us to jointly infer cosmological parameters from a sample of BBH events that include chance coincidence flares. Until the confidence of AGN associations is established, the probability of chance coincidence must be taken into account to avoid biasing astrophysical and cosmological constraints.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...914L..34P,[]
Thermonuclear Explosions and Accretion-induced Collapses of White Dwarfs in Active Galactic Nucleus Accretion Disks,"White dwarfs (WDs) embedded in the gaseous disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can rapidly accrete materials from these disks and grow in mass to reach, or even exceed, the Chandrasekhar limit. Binary WD (BWD) mergers are also believed to occur in AGN accretion disks. We study observational signatures from these events. We suggest that mass-accreting WDs and BWD mergers in AGN disks can lead to thermonuclear explosions that drive an ejecta shock breakout from the disk surface and power a slow-rising, relatively dim Type Ia supernova (SN). It is possible that such SNe Ia may be outshone by the emission of the AGN disk around a supermassive black hole (BH) with a mass of M<SUB>SMBH</SUB> ≳ 10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. In addition, accretion-induced collapses (AICs) of WDs in AGN disks may sometimes occur, which may form highly magnetized millisecond neutron stars (NSs). The subsequent spindown process of this nascent magnetar can deposit its rotational energy into the disk materials, resulting in a magnetar-driven shock breakout and a luminous magnetar-powered transient. We show that such an AIC event could power a rapidly evolving and luminous transient for a magnetic field of B ∼ 10<SUP>15</SUP> G. The rising time and peak luminosity of the transient, powered by a magnetar with B ∼ 10<SUP>14</SUP> G, are predicted to have similar properties to those of superluminous SNe. AIC events taking place in the inner parts of disks around relatively less massive supermassive BHs (M<SUB>SMBH</SUB> ≲ 10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) are more likely to power transients that are much brighter than the AGN disk emission, and hence easily identified.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...914L..19Z,[]
The Gaia-ASAS-SN Classical Cepheid Sample. I. Sample Selection,"We present a well-defined and characterized all-sky sample of classical Cepheids in the Milky Way, obtained by combining two time-domain all-sky surveys: Gaia DR2 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018) and All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN; Shappee et al. 2014). We first use parallax and variability information from Gaia to select ~30,000 bright (G < 17) Cepheid candidates with M<SUB>K</SUB> < - 1. We then analyze their ASAS-SN V-band light curves, determining periods and classifying the light curves using their Fourier parameters. This results in ~1900 likely Galactic Cepheids, which we estimate to be ≳90% complete and pure within our adopted selection criteria. This is the largest all-sky sample of Milky Way Cepheids that has such a well-characterized selection function, needed for population modeling and for systematic spectroscopic follow-up foreseen with Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V. About 130 of these potential Cepheids have not been documented in the literature even as possible candidates.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...914..127I,[]
Light Curves of Partial Tidal Disruption Events,"Tidal disruption events (TDEs) can uncover the quiescent black holes (BHs) at the center of galaxies and also offer a promising method to study them. In a partial TDE (PTDE), the BH's tidal force cannot fully disrupt the star, so the stellar core survives and only a varied portion of the stellar mass is bound to the BH and feeds it. We calculate the event rate of PTDEs and full TDEs (FTDEs). In general, the event rate of PTDEs is higher than that of FTDEs, especially for the larger BHs, and the detection rate of PTDEs is approximately dozens per year, as observed by the Zwicky Transient Factory. During the circularization process of the debris stream in PTDEs, no outflow can be launched due to the efficient radiative diffusion. The circularized debris ring then experiences viscous evolution and forms an accretion disk. We calculate the light curves of PTDEs contributed by these two processes, along with their radiation temperature evolution. The light curves have double peaks and peak in the UV spectra. Without obscuration or reprocessing of the radiation by an outflow, PTDEs provide a clean environment to study the circularization and transient disk formation in TDEs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...914...69C,[]
SN 2019yvq Does Not Conform to SN Ia Explosion Models,"We present new photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2019yvq, a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) exhibiting several peculiar properties including an excess of UV/optical flux within days of explosion, a high Si II velocity, and a low peak luminosity. Photometry near the time of first light places new constraints on the rapid rise of the UV/optical flux excess. A near-infrared spectrum at +173 days after maximum light places strict limits on the presence of H or He emission, effectively excluding the presence of a nearby nondegenerate star at the time of explosion. New optical spectra, acquired at +128 and +150 days after maximum light, confirm the presence of [Ca II] λ7300 and persistent Ca II NIR triplet emission as SN 2019yvq transitions into the nebular phase. The lack of [O I] $\lambda 6300$ emission disfavors the violent merger of two C/O white dwarfs (WDs) but the merger of a C/O WD with a He WD cannot be excluded. We compare our findings with several models in the literature postulated to explain the early flux excess including double-detonation explosions, <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mixing into the outer ejecta during ignition, and interaction with H- and He-deficient circumstellar material. Each model may be able to explain both the early flux excess and the nebular [Ca II] emission, but none of the models can reconcile the high photospheric velocities with the low peak luminosity without introducing new discrepancies.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...914...50T,[]
The Luminous and Double-peaked Type Ic Supernova 2019stc: Evidence for Multiple Energy Sources,"We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2019stc (=ZTF19acbonaa), an unusual Type Ic supernova (SN Ic) at a redshift of z = 0.117. SN 2019stc exhibits a broad double-peaked light curve, with the first peak having an absolute magnitude of M<SUB>r</SUB> = -20.0 mag, and the second peak, about 80 rest-frame days later, M<SUB>r</SUB> = -19.2 mag. The total radiated energy is large, E<SUB>rad</SUB> ≈ 2.5 × 10<SUP>50</SUP> erg. Despite its large luminosity, approaching those of Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), SN 2019stc exhibits a typical SN Ic spectrum, bridging the gap between SLSNe and SNe Ic. The spectra indicate the presence of Fe-peak elements, but modeling of the first light-curve peak with radioactive heating alone leads to an unusually high nickel mass fraction of f<SUB>Ni</SUB> ≈ 0.31 (M<SUB>Ni</SUB> ≈ 3.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). Instead, if we model the first peak with a combined magnetar spin-down and radioactive heating model we find a better match with M<SUB>ej</SUB> ≈ 4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, a magnetar spin period of P<SUB>spin</SUB> ≈ 7.2 ms, and magnetic field of B ≈ 10<SUP>14</SUP> G, and f<SUB>Ni</SUB> ≲ 0.2 (consistent with SNe Ic). The prominent second peak cannot be naturally accommodated with radioactive heating or magnetar spin-down, but instead can be explained as circumstellar interaction with ≈0.7 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of hydrogen-free material located ≈400 au from the progenitor. Accounting for the ejecta mass, circumstellar shell mass, and remnant neutron star mass, we infer a CO core mass prior to explosion of ≈6.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The host galaxy has a metallicity of ≈0.26 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>, low for SNe Ic but consistent with SLSNe. Overall, we find that SN 2019stc is a transition object between normal SNe Ic and SLSNe.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...913..143G,[]
Minimum Orbital Periods of H-rich Bodies,"In this work we derive the minimum allowed orbital periods of H-rich bodies ranging in mass from Saturn's mass to 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, emphasizing gas giants and brown dwarfs (BDs) over the range 0.0003-0.074 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Analytic fitting formulae for ${P}_{\min }$ as a function of the mass of the body and as a function of the mean density are presented. We assume that the density of the host star is sufficiently high so as not to limit the minimum period. In many instances this implies that the host star is a white dwarf. This work is aimed, in part, toward distinguishing BDs from planets that are found transiting the host white dwarf without recourse to near-infrared or radial velocity measurements. In particular, orbital periods of ≲100 minutes are very likely to be BDs. The overall minimum period over this entire mass range is ≃37 minutes.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...913..118R,[]
AGNs on the Move: A Search for Off-nuclear AGNs from Recoiling Supermassive Black Holes and Ongoing Galaxy Mergers with the Zwicky Transient Facility,"A supermassive black hole (SMBH) ejected from the potential well of its host galaxy via gravitational wave recoil carries important information about the mass ratio and spin alignment of the pre-merger SMBH binary. Such a recoiling SMBH may be detectable as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) broad-line region offset by up to 10 kpc from a disturbed host galaxy. We describe a novel methodology using forward modeling with The Tractor to search for such offset AGNs in a sample of 5493 optically variable AGNs detected with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We present the discovery of nine AGNs that may be spatially offset from their host galaxies and are candidates for recoiling SMBHs. Five of these offset AGNs exhibit double-peaked broad Balmer lines, which may have arisen from unobscured accretion disk emission, and four show radio emission indicative of a relativistic jet. The fraction of double-peaked emitters in our spatially offset AGN sample is significantly larger than the 16% double-peaked emitter fraction observed for ZTF AGNs overall. In our sample of variable AGNs we also identified 52 merging galaxies, including a new spectroscopically confirmed dual AGN. Finally, we detected the dramatic rebrightening of SDSS 1133, a previously discovered variable object and recoiling SMBH candidate, in ZTF. The flare was accompanied by the reemergence of strong P Cygni line features, indicating that SDSS 1133 may be an outbursting luminous blue variable star.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...913..102W,[]
The ZTF Source Classification Project. I. Methods and Infrastructure,"The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) has been observing the entire northern sky since the start of 2018 down to a magnitude of 20.5 (5σ for 30 s exposure) in the g, r, and i filters. Over the course of two years, ZTF has obtained light curves of more than a billion sources, each with 50-1000 epochs per light curve in g and r, and fewer in i. To be able to use the information contained in the light curves of variable sources for new scientific discoveries, an efficient and flexible framework is needed to classify them. In this paper, we introduce the methods and infrastructure that will be used to classify all ZTF light curves. Our approach aims to be flexible and modular and allows the use of a dynamical classification scheme and labels, continuously evolving training sets, and the use of different machine-learning classifier types and architectures.

SN 2018ijp: the explosion of a stripped-envelope star within a dense H-rich shell?,"In this paper, we discuss the outcomes of the follow-up campaign of SN 2018ijp, discovered as part of the Zwicky Transient Facility survey for optical transients. Its first spectrum shows similarities to broad-lined Type Ic supernovae around maximum light, whereas later spectra display strong signatures of interaction between rapidly expanding ejecta and a dense H-rich circumstellar medium, coinciding with a second peak in the photometric evolution of the transient. This evolution, along with the results of modeling of the first light-curve peak, suggests a scenario where a stripped star exploded within a dense circumstellar medium. The two main phases in the evolution of the transient could be interpreted as a first phase dominated by radioactive decays, and a later interaction-dominated phase where the ejecta collide with a pre-existing shell. We therefore discuss SN 2018jp within the context of a massive star depleted of its outer layers exploding within a dense H-rich circumstellar medium.",,[]

"A search for distant, pulsating red giants in the southern halo","To investigate the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) population in the Galactic halo, we search for pulsating AGB stars at a heliocentric distance D > 50 kpc. Our research is based on the Catalina Southern Survey (CSS) catalogue of variables, comprising 1286 long-period variables (LPVs) with δ < −20°. We first focus on the 77 stars in the cap |b| > 30° for which spectral M-type or C-type classification can be derived from Hamburg-ESO objective prism spectra. Most of these are oxygen-rich (M-type) and very few are carbon rich. The periods are in the range 100-500 days, and CSS amplitudes are up to 3 mag. In this small sample, no halo AGB star is fainter than K<SUB>s</SUB><SUB>0</SUB> = 12.5. This may be due to the scarcity of AGBs in the outer halo, or insufficient instrumental depth. Leaving aside spectral information, we then searched for even fainter pulsators (K<SUB>s</SUB> > 12.5) in the entire CSS catalogue. Gaia astrometry makes it possible to identify some contaminants. Our final result is the identification of ten candidate distant LPVs. If these ten stars obey the fundamental mode K-band period-luminosity relation used for Miras and small-amplitude Miras, their distances are between 50 and 120 kpc from the Sun. In a diagram showing distance versus Gaia tangential velocity, these ten stars have positions consistent with that of other objects in the halo, such as globular clusters and dwarf galaxies. We detect some underluminous AGBs that deserve further study. Finally, the halo LPVs ressemble the slow redder variable of globular clusters when colour and periods are compared.",,[]

Spectral separation of the stochastic gravitational-wave background for LISA: Observing both cosmological and astrophysical backgrounds,"With the goal of observing a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) with LISA, the spectral separability of the cosmological and astrophysical backgrounds is important to estimate. We attempt to determine the level with which a cosmological background can be observed given the predicted astrophysical background level. We predict detectable limits for the future LISA measurement of the SGWB. Adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used to produce estimates with the simulated data from the LISA Data Challenge. We also calculate the Cramer-Rao lower bound on the variance of the SGWB parameter estimates based on the inverse Fisher information using the Whittle likelihood.

J-GEM optical and near-infrared follow-up of gravitational wave events during LIGO's and Virgo's third observing run,"The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration (LVC) sent out 56 gravitational-wave (GW) notices during the third observing run (O3). The Japanese Collaboration for Gravitational wave ElectroMagnetic follow-up (J-GEM) performed optical and near-infrared observations to identify and observe an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. We constructed a web-based system that enabled us to obtain and share information on candidate host galaxies for the counterpart, and the status of our observations. Candidate host galaxies were selected from the GLADE catalog with a weight based on the 3D GW localization map provided by LVC. We conducted galaxy-targeted and wide-field blind surveys, real-time data analysis, and visual inspection of observed galaxies. We performed galaxy-targeted follow-ups to 23 GW events during O3, and the maximum probability covered by our observations reached 9.8$\%$. Among these, we successfully started observations for 10 GW events within 0.5 days after the detection. This result demonstrates that our follow-up observation has the potential to constrain EM radiation models for a merger of binary neutron stars at a distance of up to $\sim$100 Mpc with a probability area of $\leq$ 500 deg$^2$.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PTEP.2021eA104S,[]
A Morphological Classification Model to Identify Unresolved PanSTARRS1 Sources. II. Update to the PS1 Point Source Catalog,"We present an update to the PanSTARRS-1 Point Source Catalog (PS1 PSC), which provides morphological classifications of PS1 sources. The original PS1 PSC adopted stringent detection criteria that excluded hundreds of millions of PS1 sources from the PSC. Here, we adapt the supervised machine learning methods used to create the PS1 PSC and apply them to different photometric measurements that are more widely available, allowing us to add ∼144 million new classifications while expanding the the total number of sources in PS1 PSC by ∼10%. We find that the new methodology, which utilizes PS1 forced photometry, performs ∼6%-8% worse than the original method. This slight degradation in performance is offset by the overall increase in the size of the catalog. The PS1 PSC is used by time-domain surveys to filter transient alert streams by removing candidates coincident with point sources that are likely to be Galactic in origin. The addition of ∼144 million new classifications to the PS1 PSC will improve the efficiency with which transients are discovered.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASP..133e4502M,[]
SkyMapper optical follow-up of gravitational wave triggers: Alert science data pipeline and LIGO/Virgo O3 run,"We present an overview of the SkyMapper optical follow-up programme for gravitational-wave event triggers from the LIGO/Virgo observatories, which aims at identifying early GW170817-like kilonovae out to $∼200 Mpc$ distance. We describe our robotic facility for rapid transient follow-up, which can target most of the sky at $δ<+10\deg $ to a depth of $i_AB≈ 20 mag$ . We have implemented a new software pipeline to receive LIGO/Virgo alerts, schedule observations and examine the incoming real-time data stream for transient candidates. We adopt a real-bogus classifier using ensemble-based machine learning techniques, attaining high completeness ( $∼98%$ ) and purity ( $∼91%$ ) over our whole magnitude range. Applying further filtering to remove common image artefacts and known sources of transients, such as asteroids and variable stars, reduces the number of candidates by a factor of more than 10. We demonstrate the system performance with data obtained for GW190425, a binary neutron star merger detected during the LIGO/Virgo O3 observing campaign. In time for the LIGO/Virgo O4 run, we will have deeper reference images allowing transient detection to $i_AB≈ 21 mag$.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASA...38...24C,[]
Optical and electrical correlation effects in ZnO nanostructures: Role of pulsed laser annealing,"This paper reports the preparation and characterization of some high quality polycrystalline ZnO nanofilms (ZNFs) deposited on silicon (Si) substrates via sol gel allied spin coating process. The properties of such deposited ZNFs were modified by Nd:YAG pulsed laser annealing at varied wavelengths. The impact of pulse laser wavelengths on the structural, morphological, optical and electrical characteristics of these nanofilms was evaluated. Annealing at third harmonic generation wavelength of 355 nm was found to produce ZNFs with much better polycrystallinity and strong lattice orientation than the one annealed at the fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm. Furthermore, annealing at the second harmonic generation wavelength of 532 nm could produce a typical ZnO crystal with apparent orientation. The observed modifications in the films structure and morphology were attributed to the laser treatment-mediated thermal effect. FESEM analysis of the films revealed the existence of varied nanostructures depending on the laser wavelength. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of ZNFs exhibited a broad UV excitonic band and a narrow visible band related to defects. The laser irradiation induced generation of the oxygen vacancies were observed to reduce the electrical resistivity of the films and altered the optical band gap energies. Sample annealed at 355 nm disclosed the lowest resistivity of 23.532 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> Ω cm. Raman spectra of ZNFs confirmed the existence of hexagonal ZnO wurtzite structure. The narrowing of the E<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>high</SUP> (437 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>) Raman phonon mode due to further annealing indicated an improvement in the films crystallinity and reduction in the local atomic defects related to the oxygen vacancy (V<SUB>O</SUB><SUP>+2</SUP>). XPS analyses showed an improvement crystallinity and chemisorption of oxygen into the grain boundaries of the films due to the laser treatment in air at lower wavelength. In short, the pulsed laser annealing of ZNFs were established to be far more efficient process for the oxidation of Zn to ZnO than conventional annealing procedures.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021OptMa.11511028A,[]
Search for period changes in Mira stars,"We reobserved in the RC and i(Sloan) bands, during the years 2020-2021, seven Mira variables in Cassiopeia, for which historical i(Sloan) light curves were available from Asiago Observatory plates taken in the years 1967-84. The aim was to check if any of them had undergone a substantial change in the period or in the light curve shape. Very recent public data form ZTF-DR5 were also used to expand our time base window. A marked color change was detected for all the stars along their variability cycle. The star V890 Cas showed a significant period decrease of 12% from 483 to 428 days, one of the largest known to date. All the stars, save AV Cas, showed a smaller variation amplitude in the recent CCD data, possibly due to a photometric accuracy higher than that of the photographic plates.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021OEJV..216....1N,[]
A concordance scenario for the observed neutrino from a tidal disruption event,"During a tidal disruption event, a star is torn apart by the tidal forces of a supermassive black hole, with about 50% of the star's mass eventually accreted by the black hole. The resulting flare can, in extreme cases of super-Eddington mass accretion, result in a relativistic jet<SUP>1-4</SUP>. While tidal disruption events have been theoretically proposed as sources of high-energy cosmic rays<SUP>5,6</SUP> and neutrinos<SUP>7-14</SUP>, stacking searches indicate that their contribution to the diffuse extragalactic neutrino flux is very low<SUP>15</SUP>. However, a recent association of a track-like astrophysical neutrino (IceCube-191001A<SUP>16</SUP>) with a tidal disruption event (AT2019dsg<SUP>17</SUP>) indicates that some tidal disruption events can accelerate cosmic rays to petaelectronvolt energies. Here we introduce a phenomenological concordance scenario with a relativistic jet to explain this association: an expanding cocoon progressively obscures the X-rays emitted by the accretion disk, while at the same time providing a sufficiently intense external target of backscattered X-rays for the production of neutrinos via proton-photon interactions. We also reproduce the delay (relative to the peak) of the neutrino emission by scaling the production radius with the black-body radius. Our energetics and assumptions for the jet and the cocoon are compatible with expectations from numerical simulations of tidal disruption events.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatAs...5..472W,[]
Transient-optimized real-bogus classification with Bayesian convolutional neural networks - sifting the GOTO candidate stream,"Large-scale sky surveys have played a transformative role in our understanding of astrophysical transients, only made possible by increasingly powerful machine learning-based filtering to accurately sift through the vast quantities of incoming data generated. In this paper, we present a new real-bogus classifier based on a Bayesian convolutional neural network that provides nuanced, uncertainty-aware classification of transient candidates in difference imaging, and demonstrate its application to the datastream from the GOTO wide-field optical survey. Not only are candidates assigned a well-calibrated probability of being real, but also an associated confidence that can be used to prioritize human vetting efforts and inform future model optimization via active learning. To fully realize the potential of this architecture, we present a fully automated training set generation method which requires no human labelling, incorporating a novel data-driven augmentation method to significantly improve the recovery of faint and nuclear transient sources. We achieve competitive classification accuracy (FPR and FNR both below 1 per cent) compared against classifiers trained with fully human-labelled data sets, while being significantly quicker and less labour-intensive to build. This data-driven approach is uniquely scalable to the upcoming challenges and data needs of next-generation transient surveys. We make our data generation and model training codes available to the community.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.4838K,[]
"Variability, periodicity, and contact binaries in WISE","The time-series component of Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is a valuable resource for the study of variable objects. We present an analysis of an all-sky sample of ~450 000 AllWISE+NEOWISE infrared light curves of likely variables identified in AllWISE. By computing periodograms of all these sources, we identify ~56 000 periodic variables. Of these, ~42 000 are short-period (P < 1 d), near-contact, or contact eclipsing binaries, many of which are on the main sequence. We use the periodic and aperiodic variables to test computationally inexpensive methods of periodic variable classification and identification, utilizing various measures of the probability distribution function of fluxes and of time-scales of variability. The combination of variability measures from our periodogram and non-parametric analyses with infrared colours from WISE and absolute magnitudes, colours, and variability amplitude from Gaia is useful for the identification and classification of periodic variables. Furthermore, we show that the effectiveness of non-parametric methods for the identification of periodic variables is comparable to that of the periodogram but at a much lower computational cost. Future surveys can utilize these methods to accelerate more traditional time-series analyses and to identify evolving sources missed by periodogram-based selections.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.3975P,[]
"Core-collapse, superluminous, and gamma-ray burst supernova host galaxy populations at low redshift: the importance of dwarf and starbursting galaxies","We present a comprehensive study of an unbiased sample of 150 nearby (median redshift, z = 0.014) core-collapse supernova (CCSN) host galaxies drawn from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) for direct comparison to the nearest long-duration gamma-ray burst (LGRB) and superluminous supernova (SLSN) hosts. We use public imaging surveys to gather multiwavelength photometry for all CCSN host galaxies and fit their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to derive stellar masses and integrated star formation rates (SFRs). CCSNe populate galaxies across a wide range of stellar masses, from blue and compact dwarf galaxies to large spiral galaxies. We find 33$^{+4}_{-4}$ per cent of CCSNe are in dwarf galaxies (M<SUB>*</SUB> < 10<SUP>9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) and 2$^{+2}_{-1}$ per cent are in dwarf starburst galaxies [specific star formation rate (sSFR) > 10<SUP>-8</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>]. We reanalyse low-redshift SLSN and LGRB hosts from the literature (out to z < 0.3) in a homogeneous way and compare against the CCSN host sample. The relative SLSN to CCSN supernova rate is increased in low-mass galaxies and at high sSFRs. These parameters are strongly covariant and we cannot break the degeneracy between them with our current sample, although there is some evidence that both factors may play a role. Larger unbiased samples of CCSNe from projects such as ZTF and LSST will be needed to determine whether host-galaxy mass (a proxy for metallicity) or sSFR (a proxy for star formation intensity and potential IMF variation) is more fundamental in driving the preference for SLSNe and LGRBs in unusual galaxy environments.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.3931T,[]
An early peak in the radio light curve of short-duration gamma-ray burst 200826A,"We present the results of radio observations from the eMERLIN telescope combined with X-ray data from Swift for the short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) 200826A, located at a redshift of 0.71. The radio light curve shows evidence of a sharp rise, a peak around 4-5 d post-burst, followed by a relatively steep decline. We provide two possible interpretations based on the time at which the light curve reached its peak. (1) If the light curve peaks earlier, the peak is produced by the synchrotron self-absorption frequency moving through the radio band, resulting from the forward shock propagating into a wind medium and (2) if the light curve peaks later, the turnover in the light curve is caused by a jet break. In the former case we find a minimum equipartition energy of ~3 × 10<SUP>47</SUP> erg and bulk Lorentz factor of ~5, while in the latter case we estimate the jet opening angle of ~9-16°. Due to the lack of data, it is impossible to determine which is the correct interpretation, however due to its relative simplicity and consistency with other multiwavelength observations which hint at the possibility that GRB 200826A is in fact a long GRB, we prefer the scenario one over scenario two.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.2966R,[]
GPU-accelerated periodic source identification in large-scale surveys: measuring P and P,"Many inspiraling and merging stellar remnants emit both gravitational and electromagnetic radiation as they orbit or collide. These gravitational wave events together with their associated electromagnetic counterparts provide insight about the nature of the merger, allowing us to further constrain properties of the binary. With the future launch of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), follow-up observations and models are needed of ultracompact binary (UCB) systems. Current and upcoming long baseline time domain surveys will observe many of these UCBs. We present a new fast periodic object search tool capable of searching for generic periodic signals based on the conditional entropy algorithm. This new implementation allows for a grid search over both the period (P) and the time derivative of the period ( $\dot{P}$ ). To demonstrate the usage of this tool, we use a small, hand-picked subset of a UCB population generated from the population synthesis code COSMIC , as well as a custom catalogue for varying periods at fixed intrinsic parameters. We simulate light curves as likely to be observed by future time domain surveys by using an existing eclipsing binary light-curve model accounting for the change in orbital period due to gravitational radiation. We find that a search with $\dot{P}$ values is necessary for detecting binaries at orbital periods less than ∼10 min. We also show it is useful in finding and characterizing binaries with longer periods, but at a higher computational cost. Our code is called GCE (GPU-accelerated Conditional Entropy). It is available on Github (https://github.com/mikekatz04/gce).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.2665K,[]
A self-lensing binary massive black hole interpretation of quasi-periodic eruptions,"Binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) systems result from galaxy mergers, and will eventually coalesce due to gravitational wave (GW) emission if the binary separation can be reduced to ≲0.1 pc by other mechanisms. Here, we explore a gravitational self-lensing binary SMBH model for the sharp (duration ~1 h), quasi-regular X-ray flares - dubbed quasi-periodic eruptions - recently observed from two low-mass active galactic nuclei: GSN 069 and RX J1301.9+2747. In our model, the binary is observed ~edge-on, such that each SMBH gravitationally lenses light from the accretion disc surrounding the other SMBH twice per orbital period. The model can reproduce the flare spacings if the current eccentricity of RX J1301.9+2747 is ϵ<SUB>0</SUB> ≳ 0.16, implying a merger within ~1000 yr. However, we cannot reproduce the observed flare profiles with our current calculations. Model flares with the correct amplitude are ~2/5 the observed duration, and model flares with the correct duration are ~2/5 the observed amplitude. Our modelling yields three distinct behaviours of self-lensing binary systems that can be searched for in current and future X-ray and optical time-domain surveys: (i) periodic lensing flares, (ii) partial eclipses (caused by occultation of the background mini-disc by the foreground mini-disc), and (iii) partial eclipses with a very sharp in-eclipse lensing flare. Discovery of such features would constitute very strong evidence for the presence of a supermassive binary, and monitoring of the flare spacings will provide a measurement of periastron precession.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.1703I,[]
Horizontal spreading of planetary debris accreted by white dwarfs,"White dwarfs with metal-polluted atmospheres have been studied widely in the context of the accretion of rocky debris from evolved planetary systems. One open question is the geometry of accretion and how material arrives and mixes in the white dwarf surface layers. Using the three-dimensional (3D) radiation hydrodynamics code CO<SUP>5</SUP>BOLD, we present the first transport coefficients in degenerate star atmospheres that describe the advection-diffusion of a passive scalar across the surface plane. We couple newly derived horizontal diffusion coefficients with previously published vertical diffusion coefficients to provide theoretical constraints on surface spreading of metals in white dwarfs. Our grid of 3D simulations probes the vast majority of the parameter space of convective white dwarfs, with pure-hydrogen atmospheres in the effective temperature range of 6000-18 000 K and pure-helium atmospheres in the range of 12 000-34 000 K. Our results suggest that warm hydrogen-rich atmospheres (DA; ${rsim} 13\, 000$ K) and helium-rich atmospheres (DB and DBA; ${rsim} 30\, 000$ K) are unable to efficiently spread the accreted metals across their surface, regardless of the time dependence of accretion. This result may be at odds with the current non-detection of surface abundance variations in white dwarfs with debris discs. For cooler hydrogen- and helium-rich atmospheres, we predict a largely homogeneous distribution of metals across the surface within a vertical diffusion time-scale. This is typically less than 0.1 per cent of disc lifetime estimates, a quantity that is revisited in this paper using the overshoot results. These results have relevance for studies of the bulk composition of evolved planetary systems and models of accretion disc physics.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.1646C,[]
Observational insights on the origin of giant low surface brightness galaxies,"Giant low surface brightness galaxies (gLSBGs) with dynamically cold stellar discs reaching the radius of 130 kpc challenge currently considered galaxy formation mechanisms. We analyse new deep long-slit optical spectroscopic observations, archival optical images, and published HI and optical spectroscopic data for a sample of seven gLSBGs, for which we performed mass modelling and estimated the parameters of dark matter haloes assuming the Burkert dark matter density profile. Our sample is not homogeneous by morphology, parameters of stellar populations, and total mass, however, six of seven galaxies sit on the high-mass extension of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. In UGC 1382, we detected a global counterrotation of the stellar high surface brightness (HSB) disc with respect to the extended LSB disc. In UGC 1922 with signatures of a possible merger, the gas counterrotation is seen in the inner disc. Six galaxies host active galactic nuclei, three of which have the estimated black hole masses substantially below those expected for their (pseudo-)bulge properties suggesting poor merger histories. Overall, the morphology, internal dynamics, and low star formation efficiency in the outer discs indicate that the three formation scenarios shape gLSBGs: (i) a two-stage formation when an HSB galaxy is formed first and then grows an LSB disc by accreting gas from an external supply; (ii) an unusual shallow and extended dark matter halo; (iii) a major merger with fine-tuned orbital parameters and morphologies of the merging galaxies.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503..830S,[]
RINGO3 polarimetry of very young ZTF supernovae,"The early phases of the observed evolution of the supernovae (SNe) are expected to be dominated by the shock breakout and 'flash' ionization of the surrounding circumstellar medium. This material arises from the last stages of the evolution of the progenitor, such that photometry and spectroscopy of SNe at early times can place vital constraints on the latest and fastest evolutionary phases leading up to stellar death. These signatures are erased by the expansion of the ejecta within ~5 d after explosion. Here we present the earliest constraints, to date, on the polarization of 10 transients discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), between 2018 June and 2019 August. Rapid polarimetric follow-up was conducted using the Liverpool Telescope RINGO3 instrument, including three SNe observed within <1 d of detection by the ZTF. The limits on the polarization within the first 5 d of explosion, for all SN types, is generally $ 2{ per\ cent}$, implying early asymmetries are limited to axial ratios >0.65 (assuming an oblate spheroidal configuration). We also present polarimetric observations of the Type I Superluminous SN 2018bsz and Type II SN 2018hna, observed around and after maximum light.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503..312M,[]
The ASAS-SN catalogue of variable stars IX: The spectroscopic properties of Galactic variable stars,"The All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae provides long baseline (~4 yr) V-band light curves for sources brighter than V≲ 17 mag across the whole sky. We produced V-band light curves for a total of ~61.5 million sources and systematically searched these sources for variability. We identified ~426 000 variables, including ~219 000 new discoveries. Most (${\sim }74{ per\ cent}$) of our discoveries are in the Southern hemisphere. Here, we use spectroscopic information from LAMOST, GALAH, RAVE, and APOGEE to study the physical and chemical properties of these variables. We find that metal-poor eclipsing binaries have orbital periods that are shorter than metal-rich systems at fixed temperature. We identified rotational variables on the main-sequence, red giant branch, and the red clump. A substantial fraction (${rsim }80{ per\ cent}$) of the rotating giants have large $v$<SUB>rot</SUB> or large near-ultraviolet excesses also indicative of fast rotation. The rotational variables have unusual abundances suggestive of analysis problems. Semiregular variables tend to be lower metallicity ($\rm [Fe/H]{\sim }-0.5$) than most giant stars.

Precovery Observations Confirm the Capture Time of Asteroid 2020 CD3 as Earth's Minimoon,"Asteroid 2020 CD3 was discovered on 2020 February 15 by the Catalina Sky Survey while it was temporarily captured in a geocentric orbit before escaping Earth's Hill sphere on 2020 March 7. We searched archival images and found precoveries of 2020 CD3 from the Dark Energy Camera and Catalina Sky survey. The Dark Energy Camera images yielded three observations on 2019 January 17, while the Catalina Sky Survey images yielded four observations on 2019 January 24 from the Mt.

Searches after Gravitational Waves Using ARizona Observatories (SAGUARO): Observations and Analysis from Advanced LIGO/Virgo's Third Observing Run,"With the conclusion of the third observing run for Advanced LIGO/Virgo (O3), we present a detailed analysis of both triggered and serendipitous observations of 17 gravitational-wave (GW) events (7 triggered and 10 purely serendipitous) from the Searches After Gravitational-waves Using ARizona Observatories (SAGUARO) program. We searched a total of 4935 deg<SUP>2</SUP> down to a median 5σ transient detection depth of 21.1 AB mag using the Mt. Lemmon 1.5 m telescope, the discovery engine for SAGUARO. In addition to triggered events within 24 hr, our transient search encompassed a time interval following GW events of <120 hr, providing observations on ∼1/2 of the events accessible to the Mt. Lemmon 1.5 m telescope. We covered 2.1%-86% of the LVC total probability (P<SUB>total</SUB>) for individual events, with a median P<SUB>total</SUB> ≈ 8% within <120 hr. Following improvements to our pipeline and the addition of serendipitous observations, we find a total of seven new optical candidates across five GW events, which we are unable to rule out after searching for additional information and comparing to kilonova models. Using both publicly available and our own late-time data, we investigated a total of 252 optical candidates for these 17 events, finding that only 65% were followed up in some capacity by the community. Of the total 252 candidates, we are able to rule out an additional 12 previously reported counterpart candidates. In light of these results, we discuss lessons learned from the SAGUARO GW counterpart search. We discuss how community coordination of observations and candidate follow-up, as well as the role of archival data, are crucial to improving the efficiency of follow-up efforts and preventing unnecessary duplication of effort with limited electromagnetic resources.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912..128P,[]
I Spy Transits and Pulsations: Empirical Variability in White Dwarfs Using Gaia and the Zwicky Transient Facility,"We present a novel method to detect variable astrophysical objects and transient phenomena using anomalous excess scatter in repeated measurements from public catalogs of Gaia DR2 and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) DR3 photometry. We first provide a generalized, all-sky proxy for variability using only Gaia DR2 photometry, calibrated to white dwarf stars. To ensure more robust candidate detection, we further employ a method combining Gaia with ZTF photometry and alerts. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply this latter technique to a sample of roughly 12,100 white dwarfs within 200 pc centered on the ZZ Ceti instability strip, where hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs are known to pulsate. By inspecting the top 1% of the samples ranked by these methods, we demonstrate that both the Gaia-only and ZTF-informed techniques are highly effective at identifying known and new variable white dwarfs, which we verify using follow-up, high-speed photometry. We confirm variability in all 33 out of 33 (100%) observed white dwarfs within our top 1% highest-ranked candidates, both inside and outside the ZZ Ceti instability strip. In addition to dozens of new pulsating white dwarfs, we also identify five white dwarfs highly likely to show transiting planetary debris; if confirmed, these systems would more than triple the number of white dwarfs known to host transiting debris.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912..125G,[]
A Large Fraction of Hydrogen-rich Supernova Progenitors Experience Elevated Mass Loss Shortly Prior to Explosion,"Spectroscopic detection of narrow emission lines traces the presence of circumstellar mass distributions around massive stars exploding as core-collapse supernovae. Transient emission lines disappearing shortly after the supernova explosion suggest that the material spatial extent is compact and implies an increased mass loss shortly prior to explosion. Here, we present a systematic survey for such transient emission lines (Flash Spectroscopy) among Type II supernovae detected in the first year of the Zwicky Transient Facility survey. We find that at least six out of ten events for which a spectrum was obtained within two days of the estimated explosion time show evidence for such transient flash lines. Our measured flash event fraction (>30% at 95% confidence level) indicates that elevated mass loss is a common process occurring in massive stars that are about to explode as supernovae.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912...46B,[]
"Late-time Radio and Millimeter Observations of Superluminous Supernovae and Long Gamma-Ray Bursts: Implications for Central Engines, Fast Radio Bursts, and Obscured Star Formation","We present the largest and deepest late-time radio and millimeter survey to date of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) to search for associated nonthermal synchrotron emission. Using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we observed 43 sources at 6 and 100 GHz on a timescale of ∼ 1-19 yr post-explosion. We do not detect radio/millimeter emission from any of the sources, with the exception of a 6 GHz detection of PTF10hgi, as well as the detection of 6 GHz emission near the location of the SLSN PTF12dam, which we associate with its host galaxy. We use our data to place constraints on central engine emission due to magnetar wind nebulae and off-axis relativistic jets. We also explore nonrelativistic emission from the SN ejecta, and place constraints on obscured star formation in the host galaxies. In addition, we conduct a search for fast radio bursts (FRBs) from some of the sources using VLA phased-array observations; no FRBs are detected to a limit of 16 mJy (7σ; 10 ms duration) in about 40 minutes on source per event. A comparison to theoretical models suggests that continued radio monitoring may lead to detections of persistent radio emission on timescales of ≳ a decade.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912...21E,[]
Probing the Disk-Corona Systems and Broad-line Regions of Changing-look Quasars with X-Ray and Optical Observations,"""Changing-look"" quasars are a new class of highly variable active galactic nuclei that have changed their spectral type over surprisingly short timescales of just a few years. The origin of this phenomenon is debated, but is likely to reflect some change in the accretion flow. To investigate the disk-corona systems in these objects, we measure optical/UV-X-ray spectral indices ( ${\alpha }_{\mathrm{OX}}$ ) and Eddington ratios ( ${\lambda }_{\mathrm{Edd}}$ ) of 10 previously discovered changing-look quasars at two or more epochs. By comparing these data with simulated results based on the behavior of X-ray binaries, we find possible similarities in spectral indices below the 1% Eddington ratio. We further investigate the Eddington ratios of changing-look quasars before and after their spectral type changes, and find that changing-look quasars cross the 1% Eddington ratio boundary when their broad emission lines disappear/emerge. This is consistent with the disk-wind model as the origin of broad emission lines.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912...20J,[]
"A Population of Heavily Reddened, Optically Missed Novae from Palomar Gattini-IR: Constraints on the Galactic Nova Rate","The nova rate in the Milky Way remains largely uncertain, despite its vital importance in constraining models of Galactic chemical evolution as well as understanding progenitor channels for Type Ia supernovae. The rate has been previously estimated to be in the range of ≈10-300 yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, either based on extrapolations from a handful of very bright optical novae or the nova rates in nearby galaxies; both methods are subject to debatable assumptions. The total discovery rate of optical novae remains much smaller (≈5-10 yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) than these estimates, even with the advent of all-sky optical time-domain surveys. Here, we present a systematic sample of 12 spectroscopically confirmed Galactic novae detected in the first 17 months of Palomar Gattini-IR (PGIR), a wide-field near-infrared time-domain survey. Operating in the J band (≈1.2 μm), which is significantly less affected by dust extinction compared to optical bands, the extinction distribution of the PGIR sample is highly skewed to a large extinction values (>50% of events obscured by A<SUB>V</SUB> ≳ 5 mag). Using recent estimates for the distribution of Galactic mass and dust, we show that the extinction distribution of the PGIR sample is commensurate with dust models. The PGIR extinction distribution is inconsistent with that reported in previous optical searches (null-hypothesis probability <0.01%), suggesting that a large population of highly obscured novae have been systematically missed in previous optical searches. We perform the first quantitative simulation of a 3π time-domain survey to estimate the Galactic nova rate using PGIR, and derive a rate of $\approx {43.7}_{-8.7}^{+19.5}$ yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Our results suggest that all-sky near-infrared time-domain surveys are well poised to uncover the Galactic nova population.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912...19D,[]
"Detectability of ""Merger-nova"" Emission from a Long-lived Magnetar in Short Gamma-Ray Bursts","One possible progenitor of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is thought to be from a double neutron star (NS) merger, and the remnant of such a merger may be a supramassive NS, which is supported by rigid rotation and through its survival of hundreds of seconds before collapsing into a black hole (BH). If this is the case, an optical/infrared transient (namely merger-nova) is generated from the ejected materials and it is powered by radioactive decay from r-process, spin-down energy from a supramassive NS, as well as the magnetic wind from a newborn BH. In this paper, we systematically search for the signature of a supramassive NS central engine by analyzing the X-ray emission of short GRBs with internal plateau observed by Swift, and we find that five candidates of short GRBs have such a feature with redshift measurement. Then, we calculate the possible merger-nova emission from those candidates given the typical model parameters by considering the above three energy sources, and compare its brightness with the sensitivity of some optical telescopes. We find that the merger-nova emission of GRB 060801 in K-, r-, and U-bands with variations of M<SUB>ej</SUB> (10<SUP>-4</SUP>-10<SUP>-2</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), κ (0.1-10 cm<SUP>2</SUP> g<SUP>-1</SUP>), and β (0.1-0.3) is very difficult to detect using the Vera C. Rubin, Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS), the Zwicky Transient Facility, and the Roman Space Telescope (Roman), except for the case of large ejecta mass M<SUB>ej</SUB> = 10<SUP>-2</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. However, we are very hopeful to detect the merger-nova emission of GRBs 090515, 100625A, and 101219A using more sensitive instruments, such as Vera C. Rubin, Pan-STARRS, and Roman. Moreover, the merger-nova emission of GRB 160821B is bright enough to detect in our calculations, and it is also consistent with current real observations of merger-nova emission.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912...14Y,[]
The Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE) Alert Broker,"We introduce the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE) broker, an astronomical alert broker designed to provide a rapid and self-consistent classification of large etendue telescope alert streams, such as that provided by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and, in the future, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). ALeRCE is a Chilean-led broker run by an interdisciplinary team of astronomers and engineers working to become intermediaries between survey and follow-up facilities. ALeRCE uses a pipeline that includes the real-time ingestion, aggregation, cross-matching, machine-learning (ML) classification, and visualization of the ZTF alert stream. We use two classifiers: a stamp-based classifier, designed for rapid classification, and a light curve-based classifier, which uses the multiband flux evolution to achieve a more refined classification. We describe in detail our pipeline, data products, tools, and services, which are made public for the community (see https://alerce.science). Since we began operating our real-time ML classification of the ZTF alert stream in early 2019, we have grown a large community of active users around the globe. We describe our results to date, including the real-time processing of 1.5 × 10<SUP>8</SUP> alerts, the stamp classification of 3.4 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> objects, the light-curve classification of 1.1 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> objects, the report of 6162 supernova candidates, and different experiments using LSST-like alert streams.

Outbursting Young Stellar Object PGIR 20dci in the Perseus Arm,"We report the discovery of a likely outbursting Class I young stellar object, associated with the star-forming region NGC 281-W (distance ∼2.8 kpc). The source is currently seen only at infrared wavelengths, appearing in both the Palomar Gattini InfraRed (1.2 μm) and the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (3.4 and 4.6 μm) photometric time-domain surveys. Recent near-infrared imaging reveals a new, extended scattered light nebula. Recent near-infrared spectroscopy confirms the similarity of PGIR 20dci to FU Ori-type sources, based on strong molecular absorption in CO, H<SUB>2</SUB>O, and OH; weak absorption in several atomic lines; and a warm wind/outflow as indicated by a P Cygni profile in the He I λ10830 line.

Tails: Chasing Comets with the Zwicky Transient Facility and Deep Learning,"We present Tails, an open-source deep-learning framework for the identification and localization of comets in the image data of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), a robotic optical time-domain survey currently in operation at the Palomar Observatory in California, USA. Tails employs a custom EfficientDet-based architecture and is capable of finding comets in single images in near real time, rather than requiring multiple epochs as with traditional methods. The system achieves state-of-the-art performance with 99% recall, a 0.01% false-positive rate, and a 1-2 pixel rms error in the predicted position. We report the initial results of the Tails efficiency evaluation in a production setting on the data of the ZTF Twilight survey, including the first AI-assisted discovery of a comet (C/2020 T2) and the recovery of a comet (P/2016 J3 = P/2021 A3).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....161..218D,[]
The luminous and rapidly evolving SN 2018bcc. Clues toward the origin of Type Ibn SNe from the Zwicky Transient Facility,"Context. Supernovae (SNe) Type Ibn are rapidly evolving and bright (M<SUB>R, peak</SUB> ∼ −19) transients interacting with He-rich circumstellar material (CSM). SN 2018bcc, detected by the ZTF shortly after explosion, provides the best constraints on the shape of the rising light curve (LC) of a fast Type Ibn.",,[]
"Aims: We used the high-quality data set of SN 2018bcc to study observational signatures of the class. Additionally, the powering mechanism of SN 2018bcc offers insights into the debated progenitor connection of Type Ibn SNe.",,,[]
"Methods: We compared well-constrained LC properties obtained from empirical models with the literature. We fit the pseudo-bolometric LC with semi-analytical models powered by radioactive decay and CSM interaction. Finally, we modeled the line profiles and emissivity of the prominent He I lines, in order to study the formation of P-Cygni profiles and to estimate CSM properties.",,,[]
"Results: SN 2018bcc had a rise time to peak of the LC of 5.6<SUB>−0.1</SUB><SUP>+0.2</SUP> days in the restframe with a rising shape power-law index close to 2, and seems to be a typical rapidly evolving Type Ibn SN. The spectrum lacked signatures of SN-like ejecta and was dominated by over 15 He emission features at 20 days past peak, alongside Ca and Mg, all with V<SUB>FWHM</SUB> ∼ 2000 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>. The luminous and rapidly evolving LC could be powered by CSM interaction but not by the decay of radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni. Modeling of the He I lines indicated a dense and optically thick CSM that can explain the P-Cygni profiles.",,,[]
"Conclusions: Like other rapidly evolving Type Ibn SNe, SN 2018bcc is a luminous transient with a rapid rise to peak powered by shock interaction inside a dense and He-rich CSM. Its spectra do not support the existence of two Type Ibn spectral classes. We also note the remarkable observational match to pulsational pair instability SN models.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...649A.163K,,[]
Core-collapse supernova subtypes in luminous infrared galaxies,"The fraction of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) occurring in the central regions of galaxies is not well constrained at present. This is partly because large-scale transient surveys operate at optical wavelengths, making it challenging to detect transient sources that occur in regions susceptible to high extinction factors. Here we present the discovery and follow-up observations of two CCSNe that occurred in the luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) NGC 3256. The first, SN 2018ec, was discovered using the ESO HAWK-I/GRAAL adaptive optics seeing enhancer, and was classified as a Type Ic with a host galaxy extinction of A<SUB>V</SUB> = 2.1<SUB>−0.1</SUB><SUP>+0.3</SUP> mag. The second, AT 2018cux, was discovered during the course of follow-up observations of SN 2018ec, and is consistent with a subluminous Type IIP classification with an A<SUB>V</SUB> = 2.1 ± 0.4 mag of host extinction. A third CCSN, PSN J10275082−4354034 in NGC 3256, was previously reported in 2014, and we recovered the source in late-time archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging. Based on template light curve fitting, we favour a Type IIn classification for it with modest host galaxy extinction of A<SUB>V</SUB> = 0.3<SUB>−0.3</SUB><SUP>+0.4</SUP> mag. We also extend our study with follow-up data of the recent Type IIb SN 2019lqo and Type Ib SN 2020fkb that occurred in the LIRG system Arp 299 with host extinctions of A<SUB>V</SUB> = 2.1<SUB>−0.3</SUB><SUP>+0.1</SUP> and A<SUB>V</SUB> = 0.4<SUB>−0.2</SUB><SUP>+0.1</SUP> mag, respectively. Motivated by the above, we inspected, for the first time, a sample of 29 CCSNe located within a projected distance of 2.5 kpc from the host galaxy nuclei in a sample of 16 LIRGs. We find, if star formation within these galaxies is modelled assuming a global starburst episode and normal IMF, that there is evidence of a correlation between the starburst age and the CCSN subtype. We infer that the two subgroups of 14 H-poor (Type IIb/Ib/Ic/Ibn) and 15 H-rich (Type II/IIn) CCSNe have different underlying progenitor age distributions, with the H-poor progenitors being younger at 3σ significance. However, we note that the currently available sample sizes of CCSNe and host LIRGs are small, and the statistical comparisons between subgroups do not take into account possible systematic or model errors related to the estimated starburst ages.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...649A.134K,[]
A transmission spectrum of the planet candidate WD 1856+534 b and a lower limit to its mass,"The cool white dwarf WD 1856+534 was found to be transited by a Jupiter-sized object with a mass at or below 14 M<SUB>Jup</SUB>. We used the GTC telescope to obtain and analyse the photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy of six transits of WD 1856+534 b, with the intention of deriving the slope of the transmission spectrum. Such a slope, assuming a cloud-free atmosphere dominated by Rayleigh scattering of the particles in its atmosphere, could be translated into an estimation of the mass of WD 1856+534 b. However, the resultant transmission spectrum is essentially flat and therefore permits only the determination of lower mass limits of 2.4 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> at the 2σ level, or 1.6 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> at 3σ. These limits have implications for some of the formation scenarios proposed for the object. We elaborate on the potential effects of clouds and hazes in our estimations, based on previous studies of Jupiter and Titan. In addition, we detected an Hα absorption feature in the combined spectrum of the host white dwarf, which leads to the assignation of a DA classification and allows the derivation of an independent set of atmospheric parameters. Furthermore, the epochs of five transits were measured with sub-second precision, which demonstrates that additional objects more massive than ≈5 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> and with periods longer than O(100) days could be detected through the light-time effect.",,[]

Redshift evolution of the underlying type Ia supernova stretch distribution,"The detailed nature of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) remains uncertain, and as survey statistics increase, the question of astrophysical systematic uncertainties arises, notably that of the evolution of SN Ia populations. We study the dependence on redshift of the SN Ia SALT2.4 light-curve stretch, which is a purely intrinsic SN property, to probe its potential redshift drift. The SN stretch has been shown to be strongly correlated with the SN environment, notably with stellar age tracers. We modeled the underlying stretch distribution as a function of redshift, using the evolution of the fraction of young and old SNe Ia as predicted using the SNfactory dataset, and assuming a constant underlying stretch distribution for each age population consisting of Gaussian mixtures. We tested our prediction against published samples that were cut to have marginal magnitude selection effects, so that any observed change is indeed astrophysical and not observational in origin. In this first study, there are indications that the underlying SN Ia stretch distribution evolves as a function of redshift, and that the age drifting model is a better description of the data than any time-constant model, including the sample-based asymmetric distributions that are often used to correct Malmquist bias at a significance higher than 5σ. The favored underlying stretch model is a bimodal one, composed of a high-stretch mode shared by both young and old environments, and a low-stretch mode that is exclusive to old environments. The precise effect of the redshift evolution of the intrinsic properties of a SN Ia population on cosmology remains to be studied. The astrophysical drift of the SN stretch distribution does affect current Malmquist bias corrections, however, and thereby the distances that are derived based on SN that are affected by observational selection effects. We highlight that this bias will increase with surveys covering increasingly larger redshift ranges, which is particularly important for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...649A..74N,[]
Gravitational tuning forks and hierarchical triple systems,"We study gravitational wave (GW) emission in the strong-field regime by a hierarchical triple system composed of a binary system placed in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). The LIGO-Virgo Collaboration recently reported evidence for coalescences with this dynamical origin. These systems are common in galactic centers and thus, are a target for the space-based LISA mission as well as other advanced detectors. Doppler shifts, aberration, lensing, and strong amplitude modulations are features present in the GW signal from these systems, built into our framework and with no need for phenomenological patches. We find that the binary can resonantly excite the quasinormal modes of the SMBH, as in the resonant excitation of two tuning forks with matching frequencies. The flux of energy crossing the SMBH horizon can be significant, when compared with that from standard extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. Therefore, these triple systems are excellent probes of strong-field physics and of the BH nature of compact objects.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PhRvD.103h1501C,[]
Contemporaneous Multiwavelength and Precovery Observations of the Active Centaur P/2019 LD2 (ATLAS),"The Gateway Centaur and Jupiter co-orbital P/2019 LD2 (ATLAS) provides the first opportunity to observe the migration of a solar system small body from a Centaur orbit to a Jupiter Family Comet (JFC) four decades from now. The Gateway transition region is beyond where water ice can power cometary activity, and coma production there is as poorly understood as in all Centaurs. We present contemporaneous multiwavelength observations of LD2 from 2020 July 2-4: Gemini North visible imaging, NASA IRTF near-infrared spectroscopy, and ARO Submillimeter Telescope millimeter-wavelength spectroscopy. Precovery DECam images limit the nucleus's effective radius to ≤1.2 km and no large outbursts were seen in archival Catalina Sky Survey observations. LD2's coma has $g^{\prime} -r^{\prime} =0.70\pm 0.07$ , $r^{\prime} -i^{\prime} =0.26\pm 0.07$ , a dust-production rate of ∼10-20 kg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, and an outflow velocity between v ∼ 0.6-3.3 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>.

Near-infrared spectra show evidence for water ice at the 1%-10% level depending on grain size. Spatial profiles and archival data are consistent with sustained activity. The evidence supports the hypothesis that LD2 is a typical small Centaur that will become a typical JFC, and thus, it is critical to understanding the transition between these two populations.

Low-redshift Type Ia Supernova from the LSQ/LCO Collaboration,"This paper is the data release of a new sample of 140 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the LaSilla-QUEST/Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) collaboration. The discovery of the supernovae came from the LaSilla-QUEST variability survey, the ASASSN survey, as well as smaller low redshift supernova surveys. All of the supernovae in this sample were spectroscopically identified as SNe Ia using spectra from the PESSTO survey using the 3.5 m NTT telescope at LaSilla and spectra from the LCO 2 m Faulkes telescopes. The light-curves were obtained from a rapid cadence photometric follow up of the supernovae with the 9 LCO 1 m telescopes located at various observatories around the globe. Reference images of the host galaxies were taken approximately a year after the supernova have faded to allow precise galaxy background subtraction from the supernova magnitudes.

X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions from two previously quiescent galaxies,"Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are very-high-amplitude bursts of X-ray radiation recurring every few hours and originating near the central supermassive black holes of galactic nuclei<SUP>1,2</SUP>. It is currently unknown what triggers these events, how long they last and how they are connected to the physical properties of the inner accretion flows. Previously, only two such sources were known, found either serendipitously or in archival data<SUP>1,2</SUP>, with emission lines in their optical spectra classifying their nuclei as hosting an actively accreting supermassive black hole<SUP>3,4</SUP>. Here we report observations of QPEs in two further galaxies, obtained with a blind and systematic search of half of the X-ray sky. The optical spectra of these galaxies show no signature of black hole activity, indicating that a pre-existing accretion flow that is typical of active galactic nuclei is not required to trigger these events. Indeed, the periods, amplitudes and profiles of the QPEs reported here are inconsistent with current models that invoke radiation-pressure-driven instabilities in the accretion disk<SUP>5-9</SUP>. Instead, QPEs might be driven by an orbiting compact object. Furthermore, their observed properties require the mass of the secondary object to be much smaller than that of the main body<SUP>10</SUP>, and future X-ray observations may constrain possible changes in their period owing to orbital evolution.

Anomaly detection in the Zwicky Transient Facility DR3,"We present results from applying the SNAD anomaly detection pipeline to the third public data release of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF DR3). The pipeline is composed of three stages: feature extraction, search of outliers with machine learning algorithms, and anomaly identification with followup by human experts. Our analysis concentrates in three ZTF fields, comprising more than 2.25 million objects. A set of four automatic learning algorithms was used to identify 277 outliers, which were subsequently scrutinized by an expert. From these, 188 (68 per cent) were found to be bogus light curves - including effects from the image subtraction pipeline as well as overlapping between a star and a known asteroid, 66 (24 per cent) were previously reported sources whereas 23 (8 per cent) correspond to non-catalogued objects, with the two latter cases of potential scientific interest (e.g. one spectroscopically confirmed RS Canum Venaticorum star, four supernovae candidates, one red dwarf flare). Moreover, using results from the expert analysis, we were able to identify a simple bi-dimensional relation that can be used to aid filtering potentially bogus light curves in future studies. We provide a complete list of objects with potential scientific application so they can be further scrutinised by the community. These results confirm the importance of combining automatic machine learning algorithms with domain knowledge in the construction of recommendation systems for astronomy.

Hidden in plain sight: a double-lined white dwarf binary 26 pc away and a distant cousin,"We present high-resolution spectroscopy of two nearby white dwarfs with inconsistent spectroscopic and parallax distances. The first one, PG 1632+177, is a 13th magnitude white dwarf only 25.6 pc away. Previous spectroscopic observations failed to detect any radial velocity changes in this star. Here, we show that PG 1632+177 is a 2.05-d period double-lined spectroscopic binary (SB2) containing a low-mass He-core white dwarf with a more-massive, likely CO-core white dwarf companion. After L 870-2, PG 1632+177 becomes the second closest SB2 white dwarf currently known. Our second target, WD 1534+503, is also an SB2 system with an orbital period of 0.71 d. For each system, we constrain the atmospheric parameters of both components through a composite model-atmosphere analysis. We also present a new set of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) synthetic spectra appropriate for modelling high-resolution observations of cool white dwarfs, and show that NLTE effects in the core of the H α line increase with decreasing effective temperature. We discuss the orbital period and mass distribution of SB2 and eclipsing double white dwarfs with orbital constraints, and demonstrate that the observed population is consistent with the predicted period distribution from the binary population synthesis models. The latter predict more massive CO + CO white dwarf binaries at short (<1 d) periods, as well as binaries with several day orbital periods; such systems are still waiting to be discovered in large numbers.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.4972K,[]
Evidence that short-period AM CVn systems are diverse in outburst behaviour,"We present results of our analysis of up to 15 yr of photometric data from eight AM CVn systems with orbital periods between 22.5 and 26.8 min. Our data have been collected from the GOTO, ZTF, Pan-STARRS, ASAS-SN, and Catalina all-sky surveys and amateur observations collated by the AAVSO. We find evidence that these interacting ultracompact binaries show a similar diversity of long-term optical properties as the hydrogen accreting dwarf novae. We found that AM CVn systems in the previously identified accretion disc instability region are not a homogenous group. Various members of the analysed sample exhibit behaviour reminiscent of Z Cam systems with long superoutbursts (SOs) and standstills, SU UMa systems with regular, shorter SOs, and nova-like systems that appear only in a high state. The addition of TESS full frame images of one of these systems, KL Dra, reveals the first evidence for normal outbursts appearing as a precursor to SOs in an AM CVn system. Our results will inform theoretical modelling of the outbursts of hydrogen deficient systems.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.4953D,[]
Magnetic white dwarfs in post-common-envelope binaries,"Magnitude-limited samples have shown that 20-25 per cent of cataclysmic variables contain white dwarfs with magnetic fields of Mega Gauss strength, in stark contrast to the approximately 5 per cent of single white dwarfs with similar magnetic field strengths. Moreover, the lack of identifiable progenitor systems for magnetic cataclysmic variables leads to considerable challenges when trying to understand how these systems form and evolve. Here, we present a sample of six magnetic white dwarfs in detached binaries with low-mass stellar companions where we have constrained the stellar and binary parameters including, for the first time, reliable mass estimates for these magnetic white dwarfs. We find that they are systematically more massive than non-magnetic white dwarfs in detached binaries. These magnetic white dwarfs generally have cooling ages of more than 1 Gyr and reside in systems that are very close to Roche lobe filling. Our findings are more consistent with these systems being temporarily detached cataclysmic variables, rather than pre-cataclysmic binaries, but we cannot rule out the latter possibility. We find that these systems can display unusual asymmetric light curves that may offer a way to identify them in larger numbers in future. Seven new candidate magnetic white dwarf systems are also presented, three of which have asymmetric light curves. Finally, we note that several newly identified magnetic systems have archival spectra where there is no clear evidence of magnetism, meaning that these binaries have been previously missed. Nevertheless, there remains a clear lack of younger detached magnetic white dwarf systems.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.4305P,[]
Exploring the diversity of double-detonation explosions for Type Ia supernovae: effects of the post-explosion helium shell composition,"The detonation of a helium shell on top of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf has been argued as a potential explosion mechanism for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The ash produced during helium shell burning can lead to light curves and spectra that are inconsistent with normal SNe Ia, but may be viable for some objects showing a light-curve bump within the days following explosion. We present a series of radiative transfer models designed to mimic predictions from double-detonation explosion models. We consider a range of core and shell masses, and systematically explore multiple post-explosion compositions for the helium shell. We find that a variety of luminosities and time-scales for early light-curve bumps result from those models with shells containing <SUP>56</SUP>Ni, <SUP>52</SUP>Fe, or <SUP>48</SUP>Cr. Comparing our models to SNe Ia with light-curve bumps, we find that these models can reproduce the shapes of almost all of the bumps observed, but only those objects with red colours around maximum light (B - V ≳ 1) are well matched throughout their evolution. Consistent with previous works, we also show that those models in which the shell does not contain iron-group elements provide good agreement with normal SNe Ia of different luminosities from shortly after explosion up to maximum light. While our models do not amount to positive evidence in favour of the double-detonation scenario, we show that provided the helium shell ash does not contain iron-group elements, it may be viable for a wide range of normal SNe Ia.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.3533M,[]
Limits on mass outflow from optical tidal disruption events,"The discovery of optical/UV (ultraviolet) tidal disruption events (TDEs) was surprising. The expectation was that, upon returning to the pericentre, the stellar-debris stream will form a compact disc that will emit soft X-rays. Indeed, the first TDEs were discovered in this energy band. A common explanation for the optical/UV events is that surrounding optically thick matter reprocesses the disc's X-ray emission and emits it from a large photosphere. If accretion follows the super-Eddington mass infall rate, it would inevitably result in an energetic outflow, providing naturally the reprocessing matter. We describe here a new method to estimate, using the observed luminosity and temperature, the mass and energy of outflows from optical transients. When applying this method to a sample of supernovae, our estimates are consistent with a more detailed hydrodynamic modelling. For the current sample of a few dozen optical TDEs, the observed luminosity and temperature imply outflows that are significantly more massive than typical stellar masses, posing a problem to this common reprocessing picture.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.3385M,[]
Discovering strongly lensed QSOs from unresolved light curves,"We present a new method of discovering galaxy-scale, strongly lensed QSO systems from unresolved light curves using the autocorrelation function. The method is tested on five rungs of simulated light curves from the Time Delay Challenge 1 that were designed to match the light-curve qualities from existing, ongoing, and forthcoming time-domain surveys such as the Medium Deep Survey of the Panoramic Survey Telescope And Rapid Response System 1, the Zwicky Transient Facility, and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time. Among simulated lens systems for which time delays can be successfully measured by current best algorithms, our method achieves an overall true-positive rate of 28-58 per cent for doubly imaged QSOs (doubles) and 36-60 per cent for quadruply imaged QSOs (quads) while maintains ≲10 per cent false-positive rates. We also apply the method to observed light curves of 22 known strongly lensed QSOs, and recover 20 per cent of doubles and 25 per cent of quads. The tests demonstrate the capability of our method for discovering strongly lensed QSOs from major time domain surveys. The performance of our method can be further improved by analysing multifilter light curves and supplementing with morphological, colour, and/or astrometric constraints. More importantly, our method is particularly useful for discovering small-separation strongly lensed QSOs, complementary to traditional imaging-based methods.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.2912S,[]
Improving estimates of the growth rate using galaxy-velocity correlations: a simulation study,"We present an improved framework for estimating the growth rate of large-scale structure, using measurements of the galaxy-velocity cross-correlation in configuration space. We consider standard estimators of the velocity autocorrelation function, ψ<SUB>1</SUB> and ψ<SUB>2</SUB>, the two-point galaxy correlation function, ξ<SUB>gg</SUB>, and introduce a new estimator of the galaxy-velocity cross-correlation function, ψ<SUB>3</SUB>. By including pair counts measured from random catalogues of velocities and positions sampled from distributions characteristic of the true data, we find that the variance in the galaxy-velocity cross-correlation function is significantly reduced. Applying a covariance analysis and χ<SUP>2</SUP> minimization procedure to these statistics, we determine estimates and errors for the normalized growth rate fσ<SUB>8</SUB> and the parameter β = f/b, where b is the galaxy bias factor. We test this framework on mock hemisphere data sets for redshift z < 0.1 with realistic velocity noise constructed from the L-PICOLA simulation code, and find that we are able to recover the fiducial value of fσ<SUB>8</SUB> from the joint combination of ψ<SUB>1</SUB> + ψ<SUB>2</SUB> + ψ<SUB>3</SUB> + ξ<SUB>gg</SUB>, with 15 per cent accuracy from individual mocks. We also recover the fiducial fσ<SUB>8</SUB> to within 1σ regardless of the combination of correlation statistics used. When we consider all four statistics together we find that the statistical uncertainty in our measurement of the growth rate is reduced by $59{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ compared to the same analysis only considering ψ<SUB>2</SUB>, by $53{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ compared to the same analysis only considering ψ<SUB>1</SUB>, and by $52{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ compared to the same analysis jointly considering ψ<SUB>1</SUB> and ψ<SUB>2</SUB>.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.2087T,[]
SN 2020ank: a bright and fast-evolving H-deficient superluminous supernova,"We investigate the observational properties of a hydrogen-deficient superluminous supernova (SLSN) SN 2020ank (at z = 0.2485), with the help of early phase observations carried out between -21 and +52 d since g-band maximum. Photometrically, SN 2020ank is one of the brightest SLSN ( $M_{\mathrm{ g,peak}}\, \sim$ -21.84 ± 0.10 mag), having fast pre-peak rising and post-peak decaying rates. The bolometric light curve of SN 2020ank exhibits a higher peak luminosity (L<SUB>max</SUB>) of ∼ (3.9 ± 0.7) × 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> and appears to be symmetric around the peak with $L^{\mathrm{ rise}}_{\mathrm{ max}}$ /e ${\approx}L^{\mathrm{ fall}}_{\mathrm{ max}}$ /e ≈ 15 d. The semi-analytical light-curve modelling using the minim code suggests a spin-down millisecond magnetar with $P_i\, \sim$ 2.2 ± 0.5 ms and $B\, \sim$ (2.9 ± 0.1) $\times \, 10^{14}$ G as a possible powering source for SN 2020ank. The possible magnetar origin and excess ultraviolet flux at early epochs indicate a central-engine based powering source for SN 2020ank. Near-peak spectra of SN 2020ank are enriched with the W-shaped O II features but with the weaker signatures of C II and Fe III. Using the estimated rise time of ∼ 27.9 d and the photospheric velocity of ∼ 12 050 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, we constrain the ejecta mass to ∼ 7.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and the kinetic energy of ∼6.3 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg. The near-peak spectrum of SN 2020ank exhibits a close spectral resemblance with that of fast-evolving SN 2010gx. The absorption features of SN 2020ank are blueshifted compared to Gaia16apd, suggesting a higher expansion velocity. The spectral similarity with SN 2010gx and comparatively faster spectral evolution than PTF12dam (a slow-evolving SLSN) indicate the fast-evolving behaviour of SN 2020ank.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.1678K,[]
Improved early warning of compact binary mergers using higher modes of gravitational radiation: a population study,"A gravitational wave early warning of a compact binary coalescence event, with a sufficiently tight localization skymap, would allow telescopes to point in the direction of the potential electromagnetic counterpart before its onset. Use of higher modes of gravitational radiation, in addition to the dominant mode typically used in templated real-time searches, was recently shown to produce significant improvements in early-warning times and skyarea localizations for a range of asymmetric mass binaries. We perform a large-scale study to assess the benefits of this method for a population of compact binary merger observations. In particular, we inject 100 000 such signals in Gaussian noise, with component masses $m_1 \in \left[1, 60 \right] \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$ and $m_2 \in \left[1, 3 \right] \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$ . We consider three scenarios involving ground-based detectors: the fifth (O5) observing run of the Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network, its projected Voyager upgrade, as well as a proposed third-generation (3G) network. We find that for fixed early-warning times of 20-60 s, the inclusion of the higher modes can provide localization improvements of a factor of ≳2 for up to ${\sim}60{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ ( $70 {{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ ) of the neutron star-black hole (NSBH) systems in the O5 (Voyager) scenario. Considering only those NSBH systems that can produce potential electromagnetic counterparts, such improvements in the localization can be expected for ${\sim}5\!-\!35{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ $(20\!-\!50{{\ \rm per\ cent}})$ binaries in O5 (Voyager). For the 3G scenario, a significant fraction of the events have time gains of a minute to several minutes, assuming fiducial target localization areas of 100-1000 deg<SUP>2</SUP>.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.1612S,[]
Simulations of Torus Reverberation Mapping Experiments with SPHEREx,"Reverberation mapping (RM) is an efficient method to investigate the physical sizes of the broad line region (BLR) and dusty torus in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) mission will provide multi-epoch spectroscopic data at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. These data can be used for RM experiments with bright AGNs. We present results of a feasibility test using SPHEREx data in the SPHEREx deep regions for torus RM measurements. We investigate the physical properties of bright AGNs in the SPHEREx deep field. Based on this information, we compute the efficiency of detecting torus time lags in simulated light curves. We demonstrate that, in combination with complementary optical data with a depth of ∼20 mag in B-band, lags of ≤ 750 days for tori can be measured for more than ∼200 bright AGNs. If high signal-to-noise ratio photometric data with a depth of ∼21-22 mag are available, RM measurements are possible for up to ∼900 objects. When complemented by well-designed early optical observations, SPHEREx can provide a unique dataset for studies of the physical properties of dusty tori in bright AGNs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JKAS...54...37K,[]
"Changes in the Period of SU Sct, a Population II Cepheid","The reduction of all the available photometry for the Cepheid SU Sct has allowed its $O-C$ diagram spanning a time interval of 60 years to be constructed. Six abrupt changes in the period have been detected. The pulsation stability test proposed by Lombard and Koen (1993) has confirmed that the changes in the period are real. The absolute magnitude of SU Sct is $M<SUB>V</SUB>∼eq{-}0\overset{\textrm{m}}{.}32$, confirming that it belongs to BL Her-type Population II Cepheids.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AstL...47..252B,[]
Chromospheric Activity of Periodic Variable Stars Based on the LAMOST Low- and Medium-resolution Spectral Survey,"We present a catalog of 75,867 periodic variable stars from data release 7 of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope. We calculated the chromospheric activity index, equivalent widths for 201,349 spectra, and excess fractional luminosity ( ${R}_{{\rm{H}}\alpha }^{{\prime} }$ ) for 130,796 spectra. Based on the intensity of the Hα line, we detected 30,719 F-, G-, and K-type variable stars with Hα fill-in or emission and 2521 M-type variable stars exhibiting Hα emission. Furthermore, 14,938 out of 30,573 periodic variable stars showed Hα variability. Analysis of samples with different spectral types confirmed that the activity fraction of stars with later spectral type clearly decreases as the absolute Galactic height increases away from the Galactic plane. The results also show that at the same absolute Galactic height, the activity fractions in eclipsing binaries are higher than those in single stars. In this study, we present the activity-rotation relations for F-, G-, K-, and M-type variable stars. The results of analysis show that rapid rotators keep a saturated value, and the absolute value of the power-law index exhibits an increasing trend from F- to K-type stars in the unsaturated regime. Moreover, we confirm that the angular momentum and magnetic momentum are positively correlated, which indicates that the α-ω dynamo may be working. In addition, we confirmed the correlations among the Hα, Hβ, Hγ, Hδ, Ca II H&K, and Ca II infrared triplet lines.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..253...51L,[]
"Time-series and Phase-curve Photometry of the Episodically Active Asteroid (6478) Gault in a Quiescent State Using APO, GROWTH, P200, and ZTF","We observed the episodically active asteroid (6478) Gault in 2020 with multiple telescopes in Asia and North America and found that it is no longer active after its recent outbursts at the end of 2018 and the start of 2019. The inactivity during this apparition allowed us to measure the absolute magnitude of Gault of H<SUB>r</SUB> = 14.63 ± 0.02, G<SUB>r</SUB> = 0.21 ± 0.02 from our secular phase-curve observations. In addition, we were able to constrain Gault's rotation period using time-series photometric lightcurves taken over 17 hr on multiple days in 2020 August, September, and October. The photometric lightcurves have a repeating ≲0.05 mag feature suggesting that (6478) Gault has a rotation period of ∼2.5 hr and may have a semispherical or top-like shape, much like the near-Earth asteroids Ryugu and Bennu. The rotation period of ∼2.5 hr is near the expected critical rotation period for an asteroid with the physical properties of (6478) Gault, suggesting that its activity observed over multiple epochs is due to surface mass shedding from its fast rotation spin-up by the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack effect.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...911L..35P,[]
Gaia EDR3 Parallax Zero-point Offset Based on W Ursae Majoris-type Eclipsing Binaries,"We independently determine the zero-point offset of the Gaia early Data Release-3 (EDR3) parallaxes based on ∼110,000 W Ursae Majoris (EW)-type eclipsing binary systems. EWs cover almost the entire sky and are characterized by a relatively complete coverage in magnitude and color. They are an excellent proxy for Galactic main-sequence stars. We derive a W1-band period-luminosity relation with a distance accuracy of 7.4%, which we use to anchor the Gaia parallax zero-point. The final, global parallax offsets are -28.6 ± 0.6 μas and -25.4 ± 4.0 μas (before correction) and 4.2 ± 0.5 μas and 4.6 ± 3.7 μas (after correction) for the five- and six-parameter solutions, respectively. The total systematic uncertainty is 1.8 μas. The spatial distribution of the parallax offsets shows that the bias in the corrected Gaia EDR3 parallaxes is less than 10 μas across 40% of the sky. Only 15% of the sky is characterized by a parallax offset greater than 30 μas. Thus, we have provided independent evidence that the parallax zero-point correction provided by the Gaia team significantly reduces the prevailing bias. Combined with literature data, we find that the overall Gaia EDR3 parallax offsets for Galactic stars are [-20, -30] μas and 4-10 μas, respectively, before and after correction. For specific regions, an additional deviation of about 10 μas is found.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...911L..20R,[]
Accretion-modified Stars in Accretion Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei: Slowly Transient Appearance,"Compact objects are expected to exist in the accretion disks of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and in the presence of such a dense environment (∼10<SUP>14</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>), they will form a new kind of stellar population denoted as accretion-modified stars (AMSs). This hypothesis is supported by recent LIGO/Virgo detection of the mergers of very high-mass stellar binary black holes (BHs). We show that the AMSs will be trapped by the SMBH disk within a typical AGN lifetime. In the context of SMBH disks, the rates of Bondi accretion onto BHs are ∼10<SUP>9</SUP>L<SUB>Edd</SUB>/c<SUP>2</SUP>, where L<SUB>Edd</SUB> is the Eddington luminosity and c is the speed of light. Outflows developed from the hyper-Eddington accretion strongly impact the Bondi sphere and induce episodic accretion. We show that the hyper-Eddington accretion will be halted after an accretion interval of t<SUB>a</SUB> ∼ 10<SUP>5</SUP>m<SUB>1</SUB> s, where m<SUB>1</SUB> = m<SUB>•</SUB>/10M<SUB>⊙</SUB> is the BH mass. The kinetic energy of the outflows accumulated during t<SUB>a</SUB> is equivalent to 10 supernovae driving an explosion of the Bondi sphere and developing blast waves. We demonstrate that a synchrotron flare from relativistic electrons accelerated by the blast waves peaks in the soft X-ray band (∼0.1 keV), significantly contributing to the radio, optical, UV, and soft X-ray emission of typical radio-quiet quasars. External inverse Compton scattering of the electrons peaks around 40 GeV and is detectable through Fermi-LAT. The flare, decaying with t<SUP>-6/5</SUP> with a few months, will appear as a slowly varying transient. The flares, occurring at a rate of a few per year in radio-quiet quasars, provide a new mechanism for explaining AGN variability.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...911L..14W,[]
Magnetar-driven Shock Breakout Revisited and Implications for Double-peaked Type I Superluminous Supernovae,"The discovery of early bumps in some type-I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) before the main peaks offers an important clue to their energy source mechanisms. In this paper, we updated an analytic magnetar-powered model for fitting the multiband light curves of double-peaked SLSNe-I. The early bump is powered by magnetar-driven shock-breakout thermal emission, and the main peak is powered by a radiative diffusion through the supernova (SN) ejecta as in the standard magnetar-powered model. Generally, the diffusive luminosity is greater than the shock-breakout luminosity at the early time, which usually makes the shock-breakout bumps unclear to observe. To obtain a clear double-peaked light curve, inefficient magnetar heating at early times is required. This model is applied to three well-observed double-peaked SLSNe-I (i.e., SN2006oz, LSQ14bdq, and DES14Xtaz). We find that a relatively massive SN ejecta with M<SUB>ej</SUB> ≃ 10.2-18.1M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and relatively large kinetic energy of SN ejecta ${E}_{\mathrm{sn}}\simeq (3.8\mbox{--}6.5)\times {10}^{51}$ erg are required, and the thermalization efficiency of the magnetar heating is suppressed before t<SUB>delay</SUB>, which is in the range of ≃15-43 days. The model can reproduce the observed light curves well, with a reasonable and similar set of physical parameters for both the early bump and the main peak, strengthening support for the magnetar-powered model. In the future, modeling of the double-peaked SLSNe-I will become more feasible as more events are discovered before the early bump.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...911..142L,[]
Fast Optical Transients from Stellar-mass Black Hole Tidal Disruption Events in Young Star Clusters,"Observational evidence suggests that the majority of stars may have been born in stellar clusters or associations. Within these dense environments, dynamical interactions lead to high rates of close stellar encounters. A variety of recent observational and theoretical indications suggest stellar-mass black holes may be present and play an active dynamical role in stellar clusters of all masses. In this study, we explore the tidal disruption of main-sequence stars by stellar-mass black holes in young star clusters. We compute a suite of over 3000 independent N-body simulations that cover a range of cluster mass, metallicity, and half-mass radii. We find stellar-mass black hole tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur at an overall rate of up to roughly 200 Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> in young stellar clusters in the local universe. These TDEs are expected to have several characteristic features, namely, fast rise times of order a day, peak X-ray luminosities of at least 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, and bright optical luminosities (roughly 10<SUP>41</SUP>-10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) associated with reprocessing by a disk wind. In particular, we show these events share many features in common with the emerging class of Fast Blue Optical Transients.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...911..104K,[]
"HO Puppis: Not a Be Star, but a Newly Confirmed IW And-type Star","HO Puppis (HO Pup) was considered as a Be-star candidate based on its γ Cassiopeiae-type light curve, but lacked spectroscopic confirmation. Using distance measured from Gaia Data Release 2 and the spectral-energy-distribution fit on broadband photometry, the Be-star nature of HO Pup is ruled out. Furthermore, based on the 28,700 photometric data points collected from various time-domain surveys and dedicated intensive-monitoring observations, the light curves of HO Pup closely resemble those of IW And-type stars (as pointed out by Kimura et al.), exhibiting characteristics such as a quasi-standstill phase, brightening, and dips. The light curve of HO Pup displays various variability timescales, including brightening cycles ranging from 23 to 61 days, variations with periods between 3.9 days and 50 minutes during the quasi-standstill phase, and a semiregular ∼14 day period for the dip events. We have also collected time-series spectra (with various spectral resolutions), in which Balmer emission lines and other spectral lines expected for an IW And-type star were detected (even though some of these lines were also expected to be present for Be stars). We detect Bowen fluorescence near the brightening phase, and that can be used to discriminate between IW And-type stars and Be stars. Finally, despite only observing for four nights, the polarization variation was detected, indicating that HO Pup has significant intrinsic polarization.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...911...51L,[]
GRB 191016A: A Long Gamma-Ray Burst Detected by TESS,"The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) exoplanet-hunting mission detected the rising and decaying optical afterglow of GRB 191016A, a long gamma-ray burst (GRB) detected by Swift-BAT but without prompt XRT or UVOT follow-up due to proximity to the Moon. The afterglow has a late peak at least 1000 s after the BAT trigger, with a brightest-detected TESS data point at 2589.7 s post-trigger. The burst was not detected by Fermi-LAT, but was detected by Fermi-GBM without triggering, possibly due to the gradual nature of the rising light curve. Using ground-based photometry, we estimate a photometric redshift of z<SUB>phot</SUB> = 3.29 ± 0.40. Combined with the high-energy emission and optical peak time derived from TESS, estimates of the bulk Lorentz factor Γ<SUB>BL</SUB> range from 90 to 133. The burst is relatively bright, with a peak optical magnitude in ground-based follow-up of R = 15.1 mag. Using published distributions of GRB afterglows and considering the TESS sensitivity and sampling, we estimate that TESS is likely to detect ∼1 GRB afterglow per year above its magnitude limit.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...911...43S,[]
Infrared Echoes of Optical Tidal Disruption Events: ∼1% Dust-covering Factor or Less at Subparsec Scale,"The past decade has experienced an explosive increase of optically discovered tidal disruption events (TDEs) with the advent of modern time-domain surveys. However, we still lack a comprehensive observational view of their infrared (IR) echoes in spite of individual detections. To this end, we have conducted a statistical study of the IR variability of the 23 optical TDEs discovered between 2009 and 2018 using the full public data set of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. The detection of variability is performed on the difference images, yielding 11 objects with significant (>3σ) variability in at least one band, while dust emission can be only fit in 8 objects. Their peak dust luminosity is around 10<SUP>41</SUP>-10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, corresponding to a dust-covering factor f<SUB>c</SUB> ∼ 0.01 at a subparsec scale. The only exception is the disputed source ASASSN-15lh, which shows an ultra-high dust luminosity (∼10<SUP>43.5</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>), and this makes its nature even more elusive. Other nondetected objects show even lower f<SUB>c</SUB>, which could be lower by one more order of magnitude. The derived f<SUB>c</SUB> is generally much lower than those of dusty tori in active galactic nuclei, suggesting either a dearth of dust or a geometrically thin and flat disk in the vicinity of supermassive black holes. Our results also indicate that the optical TDE sample (post-starburst galaxies overrepresented) is seriously biased to events with little dust at subparsec scale, while TDEs in dusty star-forming systems could be more efficiently unveiled by IR echoes.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...911...31J,[]
Census of R Coronae Borealis Stars. I. Infrared Light Curves from Palomar Gattini IR,"We are undertaking the first systematic infrared (IR) census of R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars in the Milky Way, beginning with IR light curves from the Palomar Gattini IR (PGIR) survey. The PGIR is a 30 cm J-band telescope with a 25 deg<SUP>2</SUP> camera that is surveying 18,000 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of the northern sky (δ > -28°) at a cadence of 2 days. We present PGIR light curves for 922 RCB candidates selected from a mid-IR color-based catalog. Of these 922, 149 are promising RCB candidates, as they show pulsations or declines similar to RCB stars. The majority of the candidates that are not RCB stars are either long-period variables (LPVs) or RV Tauri stars. We identify IR color-based criteria to better distinguish between RCB stars and LPVs. As part of a pilot spectroscopic run, we obtain NIR spectra for 26 of the 149 promising candidates and spectroscopically confirm 11 new RCB stars. We detect strong He I λ10830 features in the spectra of all RCB stars, likely originating within high-velocity (200-400 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) winds in their atmospheres. Nine of these RCB stars show <SUP>12</SUP>C<SUP>16</SUP>O and <SUP>12</SUP>C<SUP>18</SUP>O molecular absorption features, suggesting that they are formed through a white dwarf merger. We detect quasiperiodic pulsations in the light curves of five RCB stars. The periods range between 30 and 125 days and likely originate from the strange-mode instability in these stars. Our pilot run results motivate a dedicated IR spectroscopic campaign to classify all RCB candidates.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...910..132K,[]
Forward Modeling Populations of Flares from Tidal Disruptions of Stars by Supermassive Black Holes,"Detections of the tidal disruption flares (TDFs) of stars by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are rapidly accumulating as optical surveys improve. These detections may provide constraints on SMBH demographics, stellar dynamics, and stellar evolution in galaxies. To maximize this scientific impact, we require a better understanding of how astrophysical parameters interact with survey selection effects in setting the properties of detected flares. We develop a framework for modeling the distributions of optical TDF detections in surveys across attributes of the host galaxies and the flares themselves. This model folds in effects of the stellar disruption rate in each galaxy, the flare luminosity and temperature distributions, the effects of obscuration and reddening by dust in the host galaxy, and survey selection criteria. We directly apply this model to the sample of TDFs detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility, and find that the overall flare detection rate is in line with simple theoretical expectation. The model can also reproduce the distribution of total stellar mass and redshift of the host galaxies, but fails to match all details of the detected flares, such as their luminosity and temperature distributions. We also find that dust obscuration likely plays an important role in suppressing the TDF detection rate in star-forming galaxies. While we do not find that the unusual preference of TDFs to have hosts in post-starburst galaxies in the ""green valley"" can be entirely explained by selection effects, our model can help to quantify the true rate enhancement in those galaxies.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...910...93R,[]
A Swift Fix for Nuclear Outbursts,"In November 2020, the Swift team announced an update to the UltraViolet and Optical Telescope calibration to correct for the loss of sensitivity over time. This correction affects observations in the three near-ultraviolet (UV) filters, by up to 0.3 mag in some cases. As UV photometry is critical to characterizing tidal disruption events (TDEs) and other peculiar nuclear outbursts, we recomputed published Swift data for TDEs and other singular nuclear outbursts with Swift photometry in 2015 or later as a service to the community. Using archival UV, optical, and infrared photometry, we ran host SED fits for each host galaxy. From these, we computed synthetic host magnitudes and host-galaxy properties. We calculated host-subtracted magnitudes for each transient and computed blackbody fits. In addition to the nuclear outbursts, we include the ambiguous transient ATLAS18qqn (AT2018cow), which has been classified as a potential TDE on an intermediate-mass black hole. Finally, with updated bolometric light curves, we recover the relationship of Hinkle et al., where more-luminous TDEs decay more slowly than less-luminous TDEs, with decreased scatter compared to the original relationship.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...910...83H,[]
Second Data Release of the All-sky NOIRLab Source Catalog,"We announce the second data release (DR2) of the NOIRLab Source Catalog (NSC), using 412,116 public images from CTIO-4 m+DECam, the KPNO-4 m+Mosaic3, and the Bok-2.3 m+90Prime. NSC DR2 contains over 3.9 billion unique objects, 68 billion individual source measurements, covers ≈35,000 square degrees of the sky, has depths of ≈23 mag in most broadband filters with ≈1%-2% photometric precision, and astrometric accuracy of ≈7 mas. Approximately 1.9 billion objects within ≈30,000 square degrees of sky have photometry in three or more bands. There are several improvements over NSC DR1. DR2 includes 156,662 (61%) more exposures extending over 2 more years than in DR1. The southern photometric zero-points in griz are more accurate by using the Skymapper DR1 and ATLAS-Ref2 catalogs, and improved extinction corrections were used for high-extinction regions. In addition, the astrometric accuracy is improved by taking advantage of Gaia DR2 proper motions when calibrating the astrometry of individual images. This improves the NSC proper motions to ∼2.5 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP> (precision) and ∼0.2 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP> (accuracy). The combination of sources into unique objects is performed using a DBSCAN algorithm and mean parameters per object (such as mean magnitudes, proper motion, etc.) are calculated more robustly with outlier rejection. Finally, eight multi-band photometric variability indices are calculated for each object and variable objects are flagged (23 million objects). NSC DR2 will be useful for exploring solar system objects, stellar streams, dwarf satellite galaxies, quasi-stellar objects, variable stars, high proper-motion stars, and transients. Several examples of these science use cases are presented. The NSC DR2 catalog is publicly available via the NOIRLab's Astro Data Lab science platform.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....161..192N,[]
On the Classification and Feature Relevance of Multiband Light Curves,"With an expected torrent of data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), the need for automated identification of noisy and sparse light curves will increase drastically. In this paper, we performed classification of multiband astronomical light curves from the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) data set via boosted neural nets, boosted decision trees, and a voted classifier for 14 astronomical categories. In order to deal with noisy features, we used wavelet decomposition together with feature selection. We also performed a feature ranking method using a neural network. Our method may be considered an alternative to random forests, which is known to favor features with more categories as relevant. We also investigated the class importance with neural nets using a one-versus-all approach which reduces the multiclass problem to a binary class problem.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....161..168E,[]
Photometric data-driven classification of Type Ia supernovae in the open Supernova Catalog,"We propose a novel approach for a machine-learning-based detection of the type Ia supernovae using photometric information. Unlike other approaches, only real observation data is used during training. Despite being trained on a relatively small sample, the method shows good results on real data from the Open Supernovae Catalog. We also investigate model transfer from the PLAsTiCC simulations train dataset to real data application, and the reverse, and find the performance significantly decreases in both cases, highlighting the existing differences between simulated and real data.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&C....3500451D,[]
Machine learning technique for morphological classification of galaxies from the SDSS. I. Photometry-based approach,Context. Machine learning methods are effective tools in astronomical tasks for classifying objects by their individual features. One of the promising utilities is related to the morphological classification of galaxies at different redshifts.,,[]
Aims: We use the photometry-based approach for the SDSS data (1) to exploit five supervised machine learning techniques and define the most effective among them for the automated galaxy morphological classification; (2) to test the influence of photometry data on morphology classification; (3) to discuss problem points of supervised machine learning and labeling bias; and (4) to apply the best fitting machine learning methods for revealing the unknown morphological types of galaxies from the SDSS DR9 at z < 0.1.,,,[]
"Methods: We used different galaxy classification techniques: human labeling, multi-photometry diagrams, naive Bayes, logistic regression, support-vector machine, random forest, k-nearest neighbors.",,,[]
"Results: We present the results of a binary automated morphological classification of galaxies conducted by human labeling, multi-photometry, and five supervised machine learning methods. We applied it to the sample of galaxies from the SDSS DR9 with redshifts of 0.02 < z < 0.1 and absolute stellar magnitudes of −24<SUP>m</SUP> < M<SUB>r</SUB> < −19.4<SUP>m</SUP>. For the analysis we used absolute magnitudes M<SUB>u</SUB>, M<SUB>g</SUB>, M<SUB>r</SUB>, M<SUB>i</SUB>, M<SUB>z</SUB>; color indices M<SUB>u</SUB> − M<SUB>r</SUB>, M<SUB>g</SUB> − M<SUB>i</SUB>, M<SUB>u</SUB> − M<SUB>g</SUB>, M<SUB>r</SUB> − M<SUB>z</SUB>; and the inverse concentration index to the center R50/R90. We determined the ability of each method to predict the morphological type, and verified various dependencies of the method's accuracy on redshifts, human labeling, morphological shape, and overlap of different morphological types for galaxies with the same color indices. We find that the morphology based on the supervised machine learning methods trained over photometric parameters demonstrates significantly less bias than the morphology based on citizen-science classifiers.",,,[]
"Conclusions: The support-vector machine and random forest methods with Scikit-learn software machine learning library in Python provide the highest accuracy for the binary galaxy morphological classification. Specifically, the success rate is 96.4% for support-vector machine (96.1% early E and 96.9% late L types) and 95.5% for random forest (96.7% early E and 92.8% late L types). Applying the support-vector machine for the sample of 316 031 galaxies from the SDSS DR9 at z < 0.1 with unknown morphological types, we found 139 659 E and 176 372 L types among them.",,,[]

Large-amplitude variables in Gaia Data Release 2. Multi-band variability characterization,"Context. Photometric variability is an essential feature that sheds light on the intrinsic properties of celestial variable sources, the more so when photometry is available in various bands. In this respect, the all-sky Gaia mission is particularly attractive as it collects, among other quantities, epoch photometry measured quasi-simultaneously in three optical bands for sources ranging from a few magnitudes to fainter than magnitude 20.",,[]
"Aims: The second data release (DR2) of the mission provides mean G, G<SUB>BP</SUB>, and G<SUB>RP</SUB> photometry for ∼1.4 billion sources, but light curves and variability properties are available for only ∼0.5 million of them. Here, we provide a census of large-amplitude variables (LAVs) with amplitudes larger than ∼0.2 mag in the G band for objects with mean brightnesses between 5.5 and 19 mag.",,,[]
"Methods: To achieve this, we rely on variability amplitude proxies in G, G<SUB>BP</SUB>, and G<SUB>RP</SUB> computed from the uncertainties on the magnitudes published in DR2. We then apply successive filters to identify two subsets containing sources with reliable mean G<SUB>BP</SUB> and G<SUB>RP</SUB> (for studies using colours) and sources having compatible amplitude proxies in G, G<SUB>BP</SUB>, and G<SUB>RP</SUB> (for multi-band variability studies).",,,[]
"Results: The full catalogue gathers 23 315 874 LAV candidates, and the two subsets with increased levels of purity contain, respectively, 1 148 861 and 618 966 sources. A multi-band variability analysis of the catalogue shows that different types of variable stars can be categorized according to their colours and blue-to-red amplitude ratios as determined from the G, G<SUB>BP</SUB>, and G<SUB>RP</SUB> amplitude proxies. More specifically, four groups are globally identified. They include: long-period variables in a first group with amplitudes more than twice larger in the blue than in the red; hot compact variables in a second group with amplitudes smaller in the blue than in the red; classical instability strip pulsators in a third group with amplitudes larger in the blue than in the red by 50% to 80%; and other non-pulsating variables in a fourth group, mainly achromatic, but 10% of them still having 20% to 50% larger amplitudes in the blue than in the red.",,,[]
"Conclusions: The catalogue constitutes the first census of Gaia LAV candidates extracted from the public DR2 archive. The overview presented here illustrates the added value of the mission for multi-band variability studies, even at this stage when epoch photometry is not yet available for all sources.",,,[]

Multiwavelength Observations of Fast Radio Bursts,"The origin and phenomenology of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) remains unknown despite more than a decade of efforts. Though several models have been proposed to explain the observed data, none is able to explain alone the variety of events so far recorded. The leading models consider magnetars as potential FRB sources. The recent detection of FRBs from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 seems to support them. Still, emission duration and energetic budget challenge all these models. Like for other classes of objects initially detected in a single band, it appeared clear that any solution to the FRB enigma could only come from a coordinated observational and theoretical effort in an as wide as possible energy band. In particular, the detection and localisation of optical/NIR or/and high-energy counterparts seemed an unavoidable starting point that could shed light on the FRB physics. Multiwavelength (MWL) search campaigns were conducted for several FRBs, in particular for repeaters. Here we summarize the observational and theoretical results and the perspectives in view of the several new sources accurately localised that will likely be identified by various radio facilities worldwide. We conclude that more dedicated MWL campaigns sensitive to the millisecond--minute timescale transients are needed to address the various aspects involved in the identification of FRB counterparts. Dedicated instrumentation could be one of the key points in this respect. In the optical/NIR band, fast photometry looks to be the only viable strategy. Additionally, small/medium size radiotelescopes co-pointing higher energies telescopes look a very interesting and cheap complementary observational strategy.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021Univ....7...76N,[]
Discovery of the First Interstellar Comet and the Spatial Density of Interstellar Objects in the Solar Neighborhood,"The discovery of the first interstellar comet 2I/Borisov confirmed the astronomers' speculation that the passage through the solar system of relatively large objects (asteroids and comets) formed outside of it is a common occurrence. There may be many such objects, but their discovery is still a rare case. Large professional telescopes and existing observation programs with these telescopes have limitations that can be overcome with more modest instruments. The paper describes for the first time how comet 2I/Borisov was discovered with the 65-cm telescope designed by G.V. Borisov and those features of the observation program that made it possible to make this discovery. Recommendations are given for constructing future programs for detecting such bodies. The spatial density of interstellar objects (such as asteroid 1I/'Oumuamua or comet 2I/Borisov) in the solar neighborhood has been estimated. According to our estimate, there may be about 50 interstellar bodies >50 m in size in the Solar System in a sphere with a radius of 50 AU at any given time. Since the speeds of possible approach to the Earth of such objects can be very high, such probable approaches require special attention. The use of special space projects for their study is discussed.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021SoSyR..55..124B,[]
Detectable Environmental Effects in GW190521-like Black-Hole Binaries with LISA,"GW190521 is the compact binary with the largest masses observed to date, with at least one black hole in the pair-instability gap. This event has also been claimed to be associated with an optical flare observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility in an active galactic nucleus (AGN), possibly due to the postmerger motion of the merger remnant in the AGN gaseous disk. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) may detect up to ten such gas-rich black-hole binaries months to years before their detection by Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory or Virgo-like interferometers, localizing them in the sky within ≈1 °<SUP>2</SUP> . LISA will also measure directly deviations from purely vacuum and stationary waveforms arising from gas accretion, dynamical friction, and orbital motion around the AGN's massive black hole (acceleration, strong lensing, and Doppler modulation). LISA will therefore be crucial to enable us to point electromagnetic telescopes ahead of time toward this novel class of gas-rich sources, to gain direct insight on their physics, and to disentangle environmental effects from corrections to general relativity that may also appear in the waveforms at low frequencies.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PhRvL.126j1105T,[]
SNEWS 2.0: a next-generation supernova early warning system for multi-messenger astronomy,"The next core-collapse supernova in the Milky Way or its satellites will represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity to obtain detailed information about the explosion of a star and provide significant scientific insight for a variety of fields because of the extreme conditions found within. Supernovae in our galaxy are not only rare on a human timescale but also happen at unscheduled times, so it is crucial to be ready and use all available instruments to capture all possible information from the event. The first indication of a potential stellar explosion will be the arrival of a bright burst of neutrinos. Its observation by multiple detectors worldwide can provide an early warning for the subsequent electromagnetic fireworks, as well as signal to other detectors with significant backgrounds so they can store their recent data. The supernova early warning system (SNEWS) has been operating as a simple coincidence between neutrino experiments in automated mode since 2005. In the current era of multi-messenger astronomy there are new opportunities for SNEWS to optimize sensitivity to science from the next galactic supernova beyond the simple early alert. This document is the product of a workshop in June 2019 towards design of SNEWS 2.0, an upgraded SNEWS with enhanced capabilities exploiting the unique advantages of prompt neutrino detection to maximize the science gained from such a valuable event.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NJPh...23c1201A,[]
SuperWASP variable stars: classifying light curves using citizen science,"We present the first analysis of results from the SuperWASP variable stars Zooniverse project, which is aiming to classify 1.6 million phase-folded light curves of candidate stellar variables observed by the SuperWASP all sky survey with periods detected in the SuperWASP periodicity catalogue. The resultant data set currently contains >1 million classifications corresponding to >500 000 object-period combinations, provided by citizen-scientist volunteers. Volunteer-classified light curves have ~89 per cent accuracy for detached and semidetached eclipsing binaries, but only ~9 per cent accuracy for rotationally modulated variables, based on known objects. We demonstrate that this Zooniverse project will be valuable for both population studies of individual variable types and the identification of stellar variables for follow-up. We present preliminary findings on various unique and extreme variables in this analysis, including long-period contact binaries and binaries near the short-period cut-off, and we identify 301 previously unknown binaries and pulsators. We are now in the process of developing a web portal to enable other researchers to access the outputs of the SuperWASP variable stars project.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.1299T,[]
Testing the general theory of relativity using gravitational wave propagation from dark standard sirens,"Alternative theories of gravity predict modifications in the propagation of gravitational waves (GW) through space-time. One of the smoking-gun predictions of such theories is the change in the GW luminosity distance to GW sources as a function of redshift relative to the electromagnetic (EM) luminosity distance expected from EM probes. We propose a multimessenger test of the theory of general relativity from the propagation of GWs by combining EM and GW observations to resolve these issues from GW sources without EM counterparts (which are also referred to as dark standard sirens). By using the relation between the geometric distances accessible from baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, and luminosity distance measurements from the GW sources, we can measure any deviation from the general theory of relativity via the GW sources of unknown redshift that will be detectable by networks of GW detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. Using this technique, the fiducial value of the frictional term can be measured to a precision $\Xi _0=0.98^{+0.04}_{-0.23}$ after marginalizing over redshift dependence, cosmological parameters, and GW bias parameters with ~3500 dark standard sirens of masses $30\, \rm M_\odot$ each distributed up to redshift z = 0.5. For a fixed redshift dependence, a value of $\Xi _0=0.99^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ can be measured with a similar number of dark sirens. Application of our methodology to the far more numerous dark standard sirens detectable with next-generation GW detectors, such as LISA, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will allow achievement of higher accuracy than possible from use of bright standard sirens.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502.1136M,[]
Spectroscopy of the first resolved strongly lensed Type Ia supernova iPTF16geu,"We report the results from spectroscopic observations of the multiple images of the strongly lensed Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), iPTF16geu, obtained with ground-based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). From a single epoch of slitless spectroscopy with HST, we resolve spectra of individual lensed supernova images for the first time. This allows us to perform an independent measurement of the time-delay between the two brightest images, Δt = 1.4 ± 5.0 d, which is consistent with the time-delay measured from the light curves. We also present measurements of narrow emission and absorption lines characterizing the interstellar medium in the SN Ia host galaxy at z = 0.4087, as well as in the foreground lensing galaxy at z = 0.2163. We detect strong Na ID absorption in the host galaxy, indicating that iPTF16geu belongs to a subclass of SNe Ia displaying 'anomalously' large Na ID column densities compared to dust extinction derived from light curves. For the lens galaxy, we refine the measurement of the velocity dispersion, σ = 129 ± 4 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which significantly constrains the lens model. We use ground-based spectroscopy, boosted by a factor ∼70 from lensing magnification, to study the properties of a high-z SN Ia with unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio. The spectral properties of the supernova, such as pseudo-Equivalent widths of several absorption features and velocities of the Si II-line, indicate that iPTF16geu is a normal SN Ia. We do not detect any significant deviations of the SN spectral energy distribution from microlensing of the SN photosphere by stars and compact objects in the lensing galaxy.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.502..510J,[]
New insights into time-series analysis IV: panchromatic and flux-independent period finding methods,"New time-series analysis tools are needed in disciplines as diverse as astronomy, economics, and meteorology. In particular, the increasing rate of data collection at multiple wavelengths requires new approaches able to handle these data. The panchromatic correlated indices $K^{(s)}_{(fi)}$ and $L^{(s)}_{(pfc)}$ are adapted to quantify the smoothness of a phased light-curve resulting in new period-finding methods applicable to single- and multiband data. Simulations and observational data are used to test our approach. The results were used to establish an analytical equation for the amplitude of the noise in the periodogram for different false alarm probability values, to determine the dependency on the signal-to-noise ratio, and to calculate the yield rate for the different methods. The proposed method has similar efficiency to that found for the string length period method. The effectiveness of the panchromatic and flux-independent period finding methods in single as well as multiple wavebands that share a fundamental frequency is also demonstrated in real and simulated data.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.4123F,[]
"FINK, a new generation of broker for the LSST community","FINK is a broker designed to enable science with large time-domain alert streams such as the one from the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). It exhibits traditional astronomy broker features such as automatized ingestion, annotation, selection, and redistribution of promising alerts for transient science. It is also designed to go beyond traditional broker features by providing real-time transient classification that is continuously improved by using state-of-the-art deep learning and adaptive learning techniques. These evolving added values will enable more accurate scientific output from LSST photometric data for diverse science cases while also leading to a higher incidence of new discoveries which shall accompany the evolution of the survey. In this paper, we introduce FINK, its science motivation, architecture, and current status including first science verification cases using the Zwicky Transient Facility alert stream.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.3272M,[]

The H.E.S.S. gravitational wave rapid follow-up program,"Gravitational Wave (GW) events are physical processes that significantly perturbate space-time, e.g. compact binary coalescenses, causing the production of GWs. The detection of GWs by a worldwide network of advanced interferometers offers unique opportunities for multi-messenger searches and electromagnetic counterpart associations. While carrying extremely useful information, searches for associated electromagnetic emission are challenging due to large sky localisation uncertainties provided by the current GW observatories LIGO and Virgo. Here we present the methods and procedures used within the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) in searches for very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission associated to the emission of GWs from extreme events. To do so we create several algorithms dedicated to schedule GW follow-up observations by creating optimized pointing paterns. We describe algorithms using 2-dimensional GW localisation information and algorithms correlating the galaxy distribution in the local universe, by using galaxy catalogs, with the 3-dimensional GW localisation information and evaluate their performances. The H.E.S.S. automatic GW follow-up chain, described in this paper, is optimized to initiate GW follow-up observations within less than 1 minute after the alert reception. These developements allowed H.E.S.S. observations of 6 GW events out of the 67 non-retracted GW events detected during the first three observation runs of LIGO and Virgo reaching VHE γ-ray coverages of up to 70% of the GW localisation.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JCAP...03..045A,[]
Supermassive Black Holes with High Accretion Rates in Active Galactic Nuclei. XII. Reverberation Mapping Results for 15 PG Quasars from a Long-duration High-cadence Campaign,"In this work, we present the first results of the long-term high-cadence spectroscopic monitoring of 15 PG quasars with relatively strong Fe ii emission, as a part of a broader reverberation mapping campaign performed using the Calar Alto Observatory's 2.2 m telescope. The V-band, 5100 Å continuum, and Hβ broad emission line light curves are measured for a set of quasars for periods ranging from dozens to more than a hundred epochs between 2017 May and 2020 July. Accurate time lags between the variations of the Hβ broad-line fluxes and the optical continuum strength are obtained for all 15 quasars, ranging from ${17.0}_{-3.2}^{+2.5}$?--> 17.0 - 3.2 + 2.5 to ${95.9}_{-23.9}^{+7.1}$?--> 95.9 - 23.9 + 7.1 days in the rest frame. The virial masses of the central supermassive black holes are derived for all 15 quasars, ranging between ${0.50}_{-0.19}^{+0.18}$?--> 0.50 - 0.19 + 0.18 and ${19.17}_{-2.73}^{+2.98}$?--> 19.17 - 2.73 + 2.98 in units of 10<SUP>7</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. For 11 of the objects in our sample, this is the first reverberation analysis to be published. Of the rest, two objects have been the subject of previous reverberation studies, but we determine time lags for these that are only half as long as those found in the earlier investigations, which had only been able to sample much more sparsely. The remaining two objects have previously been monitored with high sampling rates. Our results here are consistent with the earlier findings, in the sense that the time lag and the line width vary inversely, consistent with virialization.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..253...20H,[]
Be It Unresolved: Measuring Time Delays from Lensed Supernovae,"Gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) may be the next frontier in cosmic probes, able to deliver independent constraints on dark energy, spatial curvature, and the Hubble constant. Measurements of time delays between the multiple images become more incisive due to the standardized candle nature of the source, monitoring for months rather than years, and partial immunity to microlensing. While currently extremely rare, hundreds of such systems should be detected by upcoming time domain surveys. Others will have the images spatially unresolved, with the observed lightcurve a superposition of time-delayed image fluxes. We investigate whether unresolved images can be recognized as lensed sources given only lightcurve information, and whether time delays can be extracted robustly. We develop a method that we show can identify these systems for the case of lensed SNe Ia with two images and time delays exceeding ten days. When tested on such an ensemble, without microlensing, the method achieves a false-positive rate of ≲5%, and measures the time delays with a completeness of ≳93% and with a bias of ≲0.5% for Δt<SUB>fit</SUB> ≳ 10 days. Since the method does not assume a template of any particular type of SN, the method has the (untested) potential to work on other types of lensed SNe systems and possibly on other transients as well.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...910...65B,[]
Lunar Gravitational-wave Antenna,"Monitoring of vibrational eigenmodes of an elastic body excited by gravitational waves was one of the first concepts proposed for the detection of gravitational waves. At laboratory scale, these experiments became known as resonant bar detectors first developed by Joseph Weber in the 1960s. Due to the dimensions of these bars, the targeted signal frequencies were in the kHz range. Weber also pointed out that monitoring of vibrations of Earth or the Moon could reveal gravitational waves in the mHz band. His Lunar Surface Gravimeter experiment deployed on the Moon by the Apollo 17 crew had a technical failure, which greatly reduced the science scope of the experiment. In this article, we revisit the idea and propose a Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA). We find that LGWA could become an important partner observatory for joint observations with the space-borne, laser-interferometric detector LISA and at the same time contribute an independent science case due to LGWA's unique features. Technical challenges need to be overcome for the deployment of the experiment, and development of inertial vibration sensor technology lays out a future path for this exciting detector concept.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...910....1H,[]
Swift Follow-up Observations of Gravitational-wave and High-energy Neutrino Coincident Signals,"Electromagnetic observations of gravitational-wave and high-energy neutrino events are crucial in understanding the physics of their astrophysical sources. X-ray counterparts are especially useful in studying the physics of the jet, the energy of the outflow, and the particle acceleration mechanisms in the system. Ultraviolet and optical observations can help us constrain the mass and velocity of the outflow and provide hints on the viewing angle. We present the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory prompt searches for X-ray and UV/optical counterparts to the joint gravitational-wave and high-energy neutrino coincident events that happened during the third observing run of LIGO/Virgo. Swift observed the overlap between gravitational-wave and neutrino error regions for three of the considerable (p-value < 1%) joint gravitational-wave and high-energy neutrino coincident alerts, which were generated by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in real time after triggering by the LIGO/Virgo gravitational-wave public alerts. The searches did not associate any X-ray or UV/optical counterparts with any of the joint gravitational-wave and high-energy neutrino coincident events; however, the follow-up of these alerts significantly improved the tiling techniques covering regions between the gravitational-wave sky maps and the neutrino's error regions, making the real-time system ready for future potential discoveries. We discuss the details of each follow-up procedure, the results of each search, and the plans for future searches.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...909..126K,[]
A Luminous X-Ray Transient in SDSS J143359.16+400636.0: A Likely Tidal Disruption Event,"We present the discovery of a luminous X-ray transient, serendipitously detected by Swift's X-ray Telescope on 2020 February 5, located in the nucleus of the galaxy SDSS J143359.16+400636.0 at z = 0.099 (luminosity distance D<SUB>L</SUB> = 456 Mpc). The transient was observed to reach a peak luminosity of ∼10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> in the 0.3-10 keV X-ray band, which was ∼20 times more than the peak optical/UV luminosity. Optical, UV, and X-ray light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility and Swift show a decline in flux from the source consistent with t<SUP>-5/3</SUP>, and observations with NuSTAR and Chandra show a soft X-ray spectrum with photon index Γ = 2.9 ± 0.1. The X-ray/UV properties are inconsistent with well-known active galactic nucleus properties and have more in common with known X-ray tidal disruption events (TDEs), leading us to conclude that it was likely a TDE. The broadband spectral energy distribution can be described well by a disk blackbody model with an inner disk temperature of ${7.3}_{-0.8}^{+0.3}\times {10}^{5}$ K, with a large fraction (>40%) of the disk emission upscattered into the X-ray band. An optical spectrum taken with Keck/LRIS after the X-ray detection reveals LINER line ratios in the host galaxy, suggesting low-level accretion onto the supermassive black hole prior to the event, but no broad lines or other indications of a TDE were seen. The stellar velocity dispersion implies that the mass of the supermassive black hole powering the event is log(M<SUB>BH</SUB>/M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) = 7.41 ± 0.41, and we estimate that at peak the Eddington fraction of this event was ∼50%. This likely TDE was not identified by wide-field optical surveys or optical spectroscopy, indicating that more events like this would be missed without wide-field UV or X-ray surveys.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...909..102B,[]
Detection of Tidal Disruption Events around Direct-collapse Black Holes at High Redshifts with the James Webb Space Telescope,"This is the third sequel in a series discussing the discovery of various types of extragalactic transients with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in a narrow-field (∼0.1 deg<SUP>2</SUP>), moderately deep (m<SUB>AB</SUB> ∼ 27 mag) survey. In this part we focus on the detectability and observational characteristics of direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs) around them. We use existing models for DCBH accretion luminosities and spectra, as well as for TDE light curves, and find that accreting DCBH seeds may be bright enough for detection up to z ∼ 7 with JWST NIRCam imaging. TDEs of massive (M ≳ 50 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stars around them can enhance the chance for discovering them as transient objects, although the rate of such events is low, a few per survey time. TDEs around nonaccreting black holes of M ∼ 10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> may also be detected at z < 7 redshifts in the redder NIRCam bands between 3 and 5 μs. It is also shown that accreting DCBHs appear separate from supernovae on the NIRCam color-color plot, but TDEs from quiescent black holes fall in nearly the same color range as superluminous supernovae, which makes them more difficult to identify.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...909...64R,[]
Correction to the Photometric Colors of the Gaia Data Release 2 with the Stellar Color Regression Method,"The second Gaia data release (DR2) delivers accurate and homogeneous photometry data of the whole sky of an exquisite quality, reaching down to the unprecedented millimagnitude (mmag) level for the G, G<SUB>RP</SUB>, and G<SUB>BP</SUB> passbands. However, the presence of magnitude-dependent systematic effects at the 10 mmag level limits its power in scientific exploitation. In this work, using about a half million stars in common with the LAMOST DR5, we apply the spectroscopy-based stellar color regression method to calibrate the Gaia G - G<SUB>RP</SUB> and G<SUB>BP</SUB> - G<SUB>RP</SUB> colors.

Color-dependent trends are found for the G<SUB>BP</SUB> - G<SUB>RP</SUB> color and for stars brighter than G ∼ 11.5 mag.

Possible Evidence of Hydrogen Emission in the First-overtone and Multimode RR Lyrae Variables,"The nature of shock waves in nonfundamental mode RR Lyrae stars remains a mystery because of limited spectroscopic observations. We apply a pattern recognition algorithm on spectroscopic data from SDSS and LAMOST and report the first evidence of hydrogen emission in first-overtone (RRc) and multimode (RRd) RR Lyrae stars showing the ""first apparition,"" which is the most prominent observational characteristic of shock in RR Lyrae variables. We find 10 RRc stars in SDSS, 10 RRc stars in LAMOST, and 3 RRd stars in LAMOST that show blueshifted Balmer emissions. The emission features possibly indicate the existence of shock waves. We calculate the radial velocities of the emission lines, which are related to the physical conditions occurring in the radiative zone of shock waves. Using photometric observations from ZTF, we present a detailed light-curve analysis for the frequency components in one of our RRd stars with hydrogen emission, RRdl3, for possible modulations. With the enormous volume of upcoming spectral observations of variable stars, our study raises the possibility of connecting the unexplained Blazhko effect to shock waves in nonfundamental mode RR Lyrae stars.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...909...25D,[]
Photometric and Spectroscopic Investigations of the Galactic Field RRc Candidates V764 Mon and HY Com,"By analyzing photometric and spectroscopic time series, we show that the pulsator V764 Mon, assumed to be the brightest RR Lyr star in the sky, is in fact a rapidly rotating δ Sct star with an unusually long dominant period (P<SUB>1</SUB>=0.29 d). Our spectroscopy confirmed the binarity of V764 Mon discovered by the Gaia satellite. In the case of HY Com, a bona fide RRc star, we present its first complete radial velocity curve.

Alert Classification for the ALeRCE Broker System: The Light Curve Classifier,"We present the first version of the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE) broker light curve classifier. ALeRCE is currently processing the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream, in preparation for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. The ALeRCE light curve classifier uses variability features computed from the ZTF alert stream and colors obtained from AllWISE and ZTF photometry. We apply a balanced random forest algorithm with a two-level scheme where the top level classifies each source as periodic, stochastic, or transient, and the bottom level further resolves each of these hierarchical classes among 15 total classes. This classifier corresponds to the first attempt to classify multiple classes of stochastic variables (including core- and host-dominated active galactic nuclei, blazars, young stellar objects, and cataclysmic variables) in addition to different classes of periodic and transient sources, using real data. We created a labeled set using various public catalogs (such as the Catalina Surveys and Gaia DR2 variable stars catalogs, and the Million Quasars catalog), and we classify all objects with ≥6 g-band or ≥6 r-band detections in ZTF (868,371 sources as of 2020 June 9), providing updated classifications for sources with new alerts every day. For the top level we obtain macro-averaged precision and recall scores of 0.96 and 0.99, respectively, and for the bottom level we obtain macro-averaged precision and recall scores of 0.57 and 0.76, respectively. Updated classifications from the light curve classifier can be found at the ALeRCE Explorer website (http://alerce.online).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....161..141S,[]
"Initial Characterization of Active Transitioning Centaur, P/2019 LD<SUB>2</SUB> (ATLAS), Using Hubble, Spitzer, ZTF, Keck, Apache Point Observatory, and GROWTH Visible and Infrared Imaging and Spectroscopy","We present visible and mid-infrared imagery and photometry of temporary Jovian co-orbital comet P/2019 LD<SUB>2</SUB> taken with Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3), Spitzer Space Telescope/Infrared Array Camera (Spitzer/IRAC), and the GROWTH telescope network, visible spectroscopy from Keck/Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS), and archival Zwicky Transient Facility observations taken between 2019 April and 2020 August. Our observations indicate that the nucleus of LD<SUB>2</SUB> has a radius between 0.2 and 1.8 km assuming a 0.08 albedo and a coma dominated by ∼100 μm-scale dust ejected at ∼1 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> speeds with a ∼1' jet pointing in the southwest direction. LD<SUB>2</SUB> experienced a total dust mass loss of ∼10<SUP>8</SUP> kg at a loss rate of ∼6 kg s<SUP>-1</SUP> with Afρ/cross section varying between ∼85 cm/125 km<SUP>2</SUP> and ∼200 cm/310 km<SUP>2</SUP> from 2019 April 9 to 2019 November 8. If the increase in Afρ/cross section remained constant, it implies LD<SUB>2</SUB>'s activity began ∼2018 November when within 4.8 au of the Sun, implying the onset of H<SUB>2</SUB>O sublimation.

"Mysterious, variable, and extremely hot: White dwarfs showing ultra-high excitation lines. I. Photometric variability","Context. About 10% of all stars exhibit absorption lines of ultra-highly excited (UHE) metals (e.g., O VIII) in their optical spectra when entering the white dwarf cooling sequence. This is something that has never been observed in any other astrophysical object, and poses a decades-long mystery in our understanding of the late stages of stellar evolution. The recent discovery of a UHE white dwarf that is both spectroscopically and photometrically variable led to the speculation that the UHE lines might be created in a shock-heated circumstellar magnetosphere.",,[]
"Aims: We aim to gain a better understanding of these mysterious objects by studying the photometric variability of the whole population of UHE white dwarfs, and white dwarfs showing only the He II line problem, as both phenomena are believed to be connected.",,,[]
Methods: We investigate (multi-band) light curves from several ground- and space-based surveys of all 16 currently known UHE white dwarfs (including one newly discovered) and eight white dwarfs that show only the He II line problem.,,,[]
"Results: We find that 75<SUB>−13</SUB><SUP>+8</SUP>% of the UHE white dwarfs, and 75<SUB>−19</SUB><SUP>+9</SUP>% of the He II line problem white dwarfs are significantly photometrically variable, with periods ranging from 0.22 d to 2.93 d and amplitudes from a few tenths to a few hundredths of a magnitude. The high variability rate is in stark contrast to the variability rate amongst normal hot white dwarfs (we find 9<SUB>−2</SUB><SUP>+4</SUP>%), marking UHE and He II line problem white dwarfs as a new class of variable stars. The period distribution of our sample agrees with both the orbital period distribution of post-common-envelope binaries and the rotational period distribution of magnetic white dwarfs if we assume that the objects in our sample will spin-up as a consequence of further contraction.",,,[]
"Conclusions: We find further evidence that UHE and He II line problem white dwarfs are indeed related, as concluded from their overlap in the Gaia HRD, similar photometric variability rates, light-curve shapes and amplitudes, and period distributions. The lack of increasing photometric amplitudes towards longer wavelengths, as well as the nondetection of optical emission lines arising from the highly irradiated face of a hypothetical secondary in the optical spectra of our stars, makes it seem unlikely that an irradiated late-type companion is the origin of the photometric variability. Instead, we believe that spots on the surfaces of these stars and/or geometrical effects of circumstellar material might be responsible.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...647A.184R,,[]
Forbidden hugs in pandemic times. II. The luminous red nova variety: AT 2020hat and AT 2020kog,"We present the results of our monitoring campaigns of the luminous red novae (LRNe) AT 2020hat in NGC 5068 and AT 2020kog in NGC 6106. The two objects were imaged (and detected) before their discovery by routine survey operations. They show a general trend of slow luminosity rise, lasting at least a few months. The subsequent major LRN outbursts were extensively followed in photometry and spectroscopy. The light curves present an initial short-duration peak, followed by a redder plateau phase. AT 2020kog is a moderately luminous event peaking at ∼7 × 10<SUP>40</SUP> erg s<SUP>−1</SUP>, while AT 2020hat is almost one order of magnitude fainter than AT 2020kog, although it is still more luminous than V838 Mon. In analogy with other LRNe, the spectra of AT 2020kog change significantly with time. They resemble those of type IIn supernovae at early phases, then they become similar to those of K-type stars during the plateau, and to M-type stars at very late phases. In contrast, AT 2020hat already shows a redder continuum at early epochs, and its spectrum shows the late appearance of molecular bands. A moderate-resolution spectrum of AT 2020hat taken at +37 d after maximum shows a forest of narrow P Cygni lines of metals with velocities of 180 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>, along with an Hα emission with a full-width at half-maximum velocity of 250 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>. For AT 2020hat, a robust constraint on its quiescent progenitor is provided by archival images of the Hubble Space Telescope. The progenitor is clearly detected as a mid-K type star, with an absolute magnitude of M<SUB>F606W</SUB> = −3.33 ± 0.09 mag and a colour of F606W − F814W = 1.14 ± 0.05 mag, which are inconsistent with the expectations from a massive star that could later produce a core-collapse supernova. Although quite peculiar, the two objects nicely match the progenitor versus light curve absolute magnitude correlations discussed in the literature.",,[]

AT 2019avd: a novel addition to the diverse population of nuclear transients,"We report on SRG/eROSITA, ZTF, ASAS-SN, Las Cumbres, NEOWISE-R, and Swift XRT/UVOT observations of the unique ongoing event AT 2019avd, located in the nucleus of a previously inactive galaxy at z = 0.029. eROSITA first observed AT 2019avd on 2020-04-28 during its first all sky survey, when it was detected as an ultra-soft X-ray source (kT ~ 85 eV) that was ≳90 times brighter in the 0.2-2 keV band than a previous 3σ upper flux detection limit (with no archival X-ray detection at this position). The ZTF optical light curve in the ~450 days preceding the eROSITA detection is double peaked, and the eROSITA detection coincides with the rise of the second peak. Follow-up optical spectroscopy shows the emergence of a Bowen fluorescence feature and high-ionisation coronal lines ([Fe X] 6375 Å, [Fe XIV] 5303 Å), along with persistent broad Balmer emission lines (FWHM ~ 1400 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). Whilst the X-ray properties make AT 2019avd a promising tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate, the optical properties are atypical for optically selected TDEs. We discuss potential alternative origins that could explain the observed properties of AT 2019avd, such as a stellar binary TDE candidate, or a TDE involving a super massive black hole binary.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...647A...9M,[]
"Zwicky Transient Facility Observations of Trojan Asteroids: A Thousand Colors, Rotation Amplitudes, and Phase Functions","We introduce a new method for analyzing sparse photometric data of asteroids and apply it to Zwicky Transient Facility observations of the Jupiter Trojan asteroids. This method relies on the creation of a likelihood model that includes the probability distribution of rotational brightness variations at an unknown rotation phase. The likelihood model is analyzed via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo to quantify the uncertainty in our parameter estimates. Using this method, we provide color, phase parameter, absolute magnitude, and amplitude of rotation measurements for 1049 Jupiter Trojans. We find that phase parameter is correlated with color and the distribution of Trojan asteroid rotational amplitudes is indistinguishable from that of main-belt asteroids.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PSJ.....2...40S,[]
Follow-up observations for IceCube-170922A: Detection of rapid near-infrared variability and intensive monitoring of TXS 0506+056,"We present our follow-up observations to search for an electromagnetic counterpart of the IceCube high-energy neutrino IceCube-170922A. Monitoring observations of a likely counterpart, TXS 0506+056, are also described. First, we quickly took optical and near-infrared images of seven flat-spectrum radio sources within the IceCube error region right after the neutrino detection and found a rapid flux decline of TXS 0506+056 in Kanata/HONIR J-band data. Motivated by this discovery, intensive follow-up observations of TXS 0506+056 were continuously performed, including our monitoring imaging observations, spectroscopic observations, and polarimetric observations in optical and near-infrared wavelengths. TXS 0506+056 showed a large-amplitude (~1.0 mag) variability in a time scale of several days or longer, although no significant variability was detected in a time scale of a day or shorter. TXS 0506+056 also showed a bluer-when-brighter trend in optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Structure functions of the variabilities were examined and indicate that TXS 0506+056 is not a special blazar in terms of optical variability. Polarization measurement results of TXS 0506+056 are also discussed.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASJ...73...25M,[]
A GPU-accelerated image reduction pipeline,"We developed a high-speed image reduction pipeline using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) as hardware accelerators. Astronomers desire to detect the emission measure counterpart of gravitational-wave sources as soon as possible and to share in the systematic follow-up observation. Therefore, high-speed image processing is important. We developed a new image-reduction pipeline for our robotic telescope system, which uses a GPU via the Python package CuPy for high-speed image processing.

A tidal disruption event coincident with a high-energy neutrino,"Cosmic neutrinos provide a unique window into the otherwise hidden mechanism of particle acceleration in astrophysical objects. The IceCube Collaboration recently reported the likely association of one high-energy neutrino with a flare from the relativistic jet of an active galaxy pointed towards the Earth. However a combined analysis of many similar active galaxies revealed no excess from the broader population, leaving the vast majority of the cosmic neutrino flux unexplained. Here we present the likely association of a radio-emitting tidal disruption event, AT2019dsg, with a second high-energy neutrino. AT2019dsg was identified as part of our systematic search for optical counterparts to high-energy neutrinos with the Zwicky Transient Facility. The probability of finding any coincident radio-emitting tidal disruption event by chance is 0.5%, while the probability of finding one as bright in bolometric energy flux as AT2019dsg is 0.2%. Our electromagnetic observations can be explained through a multizone model, with radio analysis revealing a central engine, embedded in a UV photosphere, that powers an extended synchrotron-emitting outflow. This provides an ideal site for petaelectronvolt neutrino production. Assuming that the association is genuine, our observations suggest that tidal disruption events with mildly relativistic outflows contribute to the cosmic neutrino flux.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatAs...5..510S,[]
Tidally excited oscillations in hot white dwarfs,"We study the flux variation in helium white dwarfs (WDs) induced by dynamical tides for a variety of WD models with effective temperatures ranging from $T=10\, {\rm kK}$ to $T=26\, {\rm kK}$. At linear order, we find the dynamical tide can significantly perturb the observed flux in hot WDs. If the temperature $Trsim 14\, {\rm kK}$, then the dynamical tide may induce a fractional change in the flux by $ 1{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ when the orbital period is $P_{\rm orb}\simeq 20{\!-\!}60\, {\rm min}$. The ratio between the flux modulation due to the dynamical tide and that due to the equilibrium tide (i.e. ellipsoidal variability) increases as the WD's radius decreases, and it could exceed $\mathcal {O}(10)$ if the WD has a radius R ≲ 0.03 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Unlike the ellipsoidal variability which is in phase with the orbital motion, the pulsation caused by the dynamical tide may have a substantial phase shift. A cold WD with $T\simeq 10\, {\rm kK}$, on the other hand, is unlikely to show observable pulsations due to the dynamical tide. At shorter orbital periods, the dynamical tide may break and become highly non-linear. We approximate this regime by treating the waves as one-way travelling waves and find the flux variation is typically reduced to 0.1-1 per cent and the excess phase is ~90° (though with large uncertainty). Even in the travelling-wave limit, the flux perturbation due to dynamical tide could still exceed the ellipsoidal variability for compact WDs with R ≲ 0.02 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We further estimate the non-linear flux perturbations oscillating at four times the orbital frequency dominated by a self-coupled parent g-mode driving low-order daughter p modes. The non-linear flux variation could be nearly $50{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the linear variation for very hot WD models with $Trsim 26\, {\rm kK}$ and $1{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ linear flux variation. We thus predict that both the linear and non-linear flux variations due to dynamical tides are likely to have significant observational signatures.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.1836Y,[]
"Low-luminosity Type II supernovae - III. SN 2018hwm, a faint event with an unusually long plateau","In this work, we present photometric and spectroscopic data of the low-luminosity (LL) Type IIP supernova (SN) 2018hwm. The object shows a faint (M<SUB>r</SUB> = -15 mag) and very long (~130 d) plateau, followed by a 2.7 mag drop in the r band to the radioactive tail. The first spectrum shows a blue continuum with narrow Balmer lines, while during the plateau the spectra show numerous metal lines, all with strong and narrow P-Cygni profiles. The expansion velocities are low, in the 1000-1400 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> range. The nebular spectrum, dominated by H α in emission, reveals weak emission from [O I] and [Ca II] doublets. The absolute light curve and spectra at different phases are similar to those of LL SNe IIP. We estimate that 0.002 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass were ejected, through hydrodynamical simulations. The best fit of the model to the observed data is found for an extremely low explosion energy of 0.055 foe, a progenitor radius of 215 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and a final progenitor mass of 9-10 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Finally, we performed a modelling of the nebular spectrum, to establish the amount of oxygen and calcium ejected. We found a low M(<SUP>16</SUP>O)$\approx 0.02\, \mathrm{ M}_{\odot }$, but a high M(<SUP>40</SUP>Ca) of 0.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The inferred low explosion energy, the low ejected <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass, and the progenitor parameters, along with peculiar features observed in the nebular spectrum, are consistent with both an electron-capture SN explosion of a superasymptotic giant branch star and with a low-energy, Ni-poor iron core-collapse SN from a 10-12 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> red supergiant.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.1059R,[]
"High-cadence, early-time observations of core-collapse supernovae from the TESS prime mission","We present observations from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) of twenty bright core-collapse supernovae with peak TESS-band magnitudes ≲18 mag. We reduce this data with an implementation of the image subtraction pipeline used by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) optimized for use with the TESS images. In empirical fits to the rising light curves, we do not find strong correlations between the fit parameters and the peak luminosity. Existing semi-analytic models fit the light curves of the Type II supernovae well, but do not yield reasonable estimates of the progenitor radius or explosion energy, likely because they are derived for use with ultraviolet observations while TESS observes in the near-infrared. If we instead fit the data with numerically simulated light curves, the rising light curves of the Type II supernovae are consistent with the explosions of red supergiants. While we do not identify shock breakout emission for any individual event, when we combine the fit residuals of the Type II supernovae in our sample, we do find a >5σ flux excess in the ~1 d before the start of the light-curve rise. It is likely that this excess is due to shock breakout emission, and that during its extended mission TESS will observe a Type II supernova bright enough for this signal to be detected directly.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.500.5639V,[]

Our APO data spans over 318 d and includes 13 primary eclipses, from which we precisely measure the system's orbital period and improve the time of mid-eclipse measurement.

Calibrating the binary black hole population in nuclear star clusters through tidal disruption events,"As the sensitivity of gravitational wave (GW) instruments improves and new networks start operating, hundreds of merging stellar-mass black holes (SBHs) and intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are expected to be observed in the next few years. The origin and distribution of SBH and IMBH binaries in various dynamical environments is a fundamental scientific question in GW astronomy. In this paper, we discuss ways tidal disruption events (TDEs) may provide a unique electromagnetic window into the assembly and merger of binary SBHs and IMBHs in nuclear star clusters (NSCs). We discuss how the host NSC mass and density and the slope of the BH mass function set the orbital properties and the masses of the binaries that undergo a TDE. For typical NSC properties, we predict a TDE rate of ~10<SUP>-6</SUP>-10<SUP>-7</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> per galaxy. The light curve of TDEs in NSCs could be interrupted and modulated by the companion BH on the orbital period of the binary.

Gravitational wave friction in light of GW170817 and GW190521,"We use the gravitational wave (GW) events GW170817 and GW190521, together with their proposed electromagnetic counterparts, to constrain cosmological parameters and theories of gravity beyond General Relativity (GR). In particular we consider models with a time-varying Planck mass, large extra-dimensions, and a phenomenological parametrization covering several beyond-GR theories. In all three cases, this introduces a friction term into the GW propagation equation, effectively modifying the GW luminosity distance. We set constraints on \LCDM parameters and GR deviation parameters using two sets of priors on the Hubble constant and matter energy density. With priors set to the measured Planck's mission values, we find that with the inclusion of GW190521, the two GR deviation parameters constraints improve by a factor ~ 10. We report a number of space-time dimensions compatible with 4 with an precision of 2.5% (at 95% CL) and an upper limit to the variation of Newton's constant at the epoch of GW170817 of <20%. With wide priors on the Hubble constant and matter energy density, we show that it is still possible to constrain the \LCDM parameters and GR deviation parameters conjointly from GW170817 and GW190521, obtaining constraints on GR deviation parameters which are a factor 2-6 worse than the results using restricted priors on \LCDM parameters.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JCAP...02..043M,[]
Electromagnetic bursts from mergers of oscillons in axion-like fields,"We investigate the bursts of electromagnetic and scalar radiation resulting from the collision, and merger of oscillons made from axion-like particles using 3+1 dimensional lattice simulations of the coupled axion-gauge field system. The radiation into photons is suppressed before the merger. However, it becomes the dominant source of energy loss after the merger if a resonance condition is satisfied. Conversely, the radiation in scalar waves is dominant during initial merger phase but suppressed after the merger. The backreaction of scalar and electromagnetic radiation is included in our simulations. We evolve the system long enough to see that the resonant photon production extracts a significant fraction of the initial axion energy, and again falls out of the resonance condition. We provide a parametric understanding of the time, and energy scales involved in the process and discuss observational prospects of detecting the electromagnetic signal.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JCAP...02..024A,[]
Mid-infrared Outbursts in Nearby Galaxies (MIRONG). I. Sample Selection and Characterization,"Optical time-domain astronomy has grown rapidly in the past decade, but the dynamic infrared sky is rarely explored. Aiming to construct a sample of mid-infrared outbursts in nearby galaxies (MIRONG), we have conducted a systematical search of low-redshift (z < 0.35) Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic galaxies that have experienced recent mid-infrared (MIR) flares using their Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) light curves. A total of 137 galaxies have been selected by requiring a brightening amplitude of 0.5 mag in at least one WISE band with respect to their quiescent phases. Only a small fraction (10.9%) has corresponding optical flares. Except for the four supernovae (SNe) in our sample, the MIR luminosities of the remaining sources (L<SUB>4.6 μm</SUB> > 10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) are markedly brighter than known SNe, and their physical locations are very close to the galactic center (median <0""1). Only four galaxies are radio-loud, indicating that synchrotron radiation from relativistic jets could contribute to MIR variability. We propose that these MIR outbursts are dominated by the dust echoes of transient accretion onto supermassive black holes, such as tidal disruption events (TDEs) and turn-on (changing-look) active galactic nuclei. Moreover, the inferred peak MIR luminosity function is generally consistent with the X-ray and optical TDEs at the high end, albeit with large uncertainties. Our results suggest that a large population of transients has been overlooked by optical surveys, probably due to dust obscuration or intrinsically optical weakness. Thus, a search in the infrared band is crucial for us to obtain a panoramic picture of nuclear outburst. The multiwavelength follow-up observations of the MIRONG sample are in progress and will be presented in a series of subsequent papers.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..252...32J,[]
Measuring the Hubble Constant with GW190521 as an Eccentric black hole Merger and Its Potential Electromagnetic Counterpart,"Gravitational-wave observations can be used to accurately measure the Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB> and could help understand the present discrepancy between constraints from Type Ia supernovae and the cosmic microwave background. Neutron star mergers are primarily used for this purpose as their electromagnetic emission can be used to greatly reduce measurement uncertainties. Here we quantify the implied H<SUB>0</SUB> using the recently observed black hole merger GW190521 and its candidate electromagnetic counterpart found by ZTF using a highly eccentric explanation of the properties of GW190521. As the electromagnetic association is currently uncertain, our main goal here is to determine the effect of eccentricity on the estimated H<SUB>0</SUB>. We obtain ${H}_{0}={68.8}_{-25.5}^{+45.7}$ km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Our results indicate that future H<SUB>0</SUB> computations using black hole mergers will need to account for possible eccentricity. For extreme cases, the orbital velocity of binaries in active galactic nucleus disks can represent a significant systematic uncertainty.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908L..34G,[]
Tidal Disruption Event Hosts Are Green and Centrally Concentrated: Signatures of a Post-merger System,"We study the properties of the galaxies hosting the first 19 tidal disruption events (TDEs) detected with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) within the context of a carefully constructed, representative host galaxy sample. We find that the ZTF sample of TDE hosts is dominated by compact ""green valley"" galaxies. After we restrict the comparison sample to galaxies with a similar concentration, as measured by the Sérsic index, we find this green valley overrepresentation is even larger. That is, concentrated red sequence galaxies are not producing TDEs at elevated levels. We present host galaxy spectra that show that E + A galaxies are overrepresented in the ZTF sample by a factor of ≈22, which is lower than previous TDE host galaxy studies have found. We find that this overrepresentation can be fully accounted for when taking into account the masses, colors, and Sérsic indices of the ZTF TDE hosts. The combination of both green colors and high Sérsic index of the typical TDE host galaxy could be explained if the TDE rate is temporarily enhanced following a merger that leads to a higher central concentration of stars.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908L..20H,[]
Constraints on the Rate of Supernovae Lasting for More Than a Year from Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam,"Some supernovae, such as pair-instability supernovae, are predicted to have a duration of more than a year in the observer frame. To constrain the rates of supernovae lasting for more than a year, we conducted a long-term deep transient survey using Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the 8.2 m Subaru telescope. HSC is a wide-field (a 1.75 deg<SUP>2</SUP> field-of-view) camera and it can efficiently conduct transient surveys. We observed the same 1.75 deg<SUP>2</SUP> field repeatedly using the g-, r-, i-, and z-band filters with the typical depth of 26 mag for four seasons (from late 2016 to early 2020). Using these data, we searched for transients lasting for more than a year. Two supernovae were detected in two continuous seasons, one supernova was detected in three continuous seasons, but no transients lasted for all four seasons searched. The discovery rate of supernovae lasting for more than a year with the typical limiting magnitudes of 26 mag is constrained to be ${1.4}_{-0.7}^{+1.3}$ $(\mathrm{stat}.){}_{-0.3}^{+0.2}(\mathrm{sys}.)\,\mathrm{events}\,{\deg }^{-2}\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$ . All the long-lasting supernovae we found are likely Type IIn supernovae and our results indicate that about 40% of Type IIn supernovae have long-lasting light curves. No plausible pair-instability supernova candidates lasting for more than a year are discovered. By comparing the survey results and survey simulations, we constrain the luminous pair-instability supernova rate up to z ≃ 3 is of the order of 100 Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> at most, which is 0.01-0.1% of the core-collapse supernova rate.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908..249M,[]
"Near-infrared and Optical Observations of Type Ic SN 2020oi and Broad-lined Type Ic SN 2020bvc: Carbon Monoxide, Dust, and High-velocity Supernova Ejecta","We present near-IR (NIR) and optical observations of the Type Ic supernova (SN Ic) SN 2020oi in the galaxy M100 and the broad-lined SN Ic SN 2020bvc in UGC 9379, using Gemini, Las Cumbres Observatory, Southern Astrophysical Telescope, and other ground-based telescopes. The NIR spectrum of SN 2020oi at day 63 since the explosion shows strong CO emissions and a rising K-band continuum, which is the first unambiguous dust detection from an SN Ic. Non-LTE CO modeling shows that CO is still optically thick and that the lower limit to the CO mass is 10<SUP>-3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The dust temperature is 810 K, and the dust mass is ∼10<SUP>-5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We explore the possibilities that the dust is freshly formed in the ejecta, heated dust in the preexisting circumstellar medium, and an infrared echo. The light curves of SN 2020oi are consistent with a STELLA model with canonical explosion energy, 0.07 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> Ni mass, and 0.7 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> ejecta mass. A model of high explosion energy of 10<SUP>52</SUP> erg, 0.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> Ni mass, and 6.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> ejecta mass with the circumstellar matter reproduces the double-peaked light curves of SN 2020bvc. We observe temporal changes of absorption features of the IR Ca II triplet, S I at 1.043 μm, and Fe II at 5169 Å. The blueshifted lines indicate high velocities, up to 60,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> for SN 2020bvc and 20,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> for SN 2020oi, and the expansion velocity rapidly declines before the optical maximum.

Identifying Candidate Optical Variables Using Gaia Data Release 2,"Gaia is undertaking a deep synoptic survey of the Galaxy, but photometry from individual epochs has, as of yet, only been released for a minimal number of sources. We show that it is possible to identify variable stars in Gaia Data Release 2 by selecting stars with unexpectedly large photometric uncertainties given their brightness and number of observations. By comparing our results to existing catalogs of variables, we show that information on the amplitude of variability is also implicitly present in the Gaia photometric uncertainties. We present a catalog of about 9.3 million candidate variable stars, and discuss its limitations and prospects for future tests and extensions.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908..180A,[]
GHOST: Using Only Host Galaxy Information to Accurately Associate and Distinguish Supernovae,"We present GHOST, a database of 16,175 spectroscopically classified supernovae (SNe) and the properties of their host galaxies. We have constructed GHOST using a novel host galaxy association method that employs deep postage stamps of the field surrounding a transient. Our gradient ascent method achieves fewer misassociations for low-z hosts and higher completeness for high-z hosts than previous methods. Using dimensionality reduction, we identify the host galaxy properties that distinguish SN classes. Our results suggest that the host galaxies of superluminous SNe, Type Ia SNe, and core-collapse SNe can be separated by brightness and derived extendedness measures. Next, we train a random forest model to predict SN class using only host galaxy information and the radial offset of the SN. We can distinguish Type Ia SNe and core-collapse SNe with ∼70% accuracy without any photometric or spectroscopic data from the event itself. Vera C. Rubin Observatory will usher in a new era of transient population studies, demanding improved photometric tools for rapid identification and classification of transient events. By identifying the host features with high discriminatory power, we will maintain SN sample purities and continue to identify scientifically relevant events as data volumes increase. The GHOST database and our corresponding software for associating transients with host galaxies are both publicly available through the astro_ghost package.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908..170G,[]
"The Young Supernova Experiment: Survey Goals, Overview, and Operations","Time-domain science has undergone a revolution over the past decade, with tens of thousands of new supernovae (SNe) discovered each year. However, several observational domains, including SNe within days or hours of explosion and faint, red transients, are just beginning to be explored. Here we present the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE), a novel optical time-domain survey on the Pan-STARRS telescopes. Our survey is designed to obtain well-sampled griz light curves for thousands of transient events up to z ≈ 0.2. This large sample of transients with four-band light curves will lay the foundation for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, providing a critical training set in similar filters and a well-calibrated low-redshift anchor of cosmologically useful SNe Ia to benefit dark energy science. As the name suggests, YSE complements and extends other ongoing time-domain surveys by discovering fast-rising SNe within a few hours to days of explosion. YSE is the only current four-band time-domain survey and is able to discover transients as faint as ∼21.5 mag in gri and ∼20.5 mag in z, depths that allow us to probe the earliest epochs of stellar explosions. YSE is currently observing approximately 750 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of sky every 3 days, and we plan to increase the area to 1500 deg<SUP>2</SUP> in the near future. When operating at full capacity, survey simulations show that YSE will find ∼5000 new SNe per year and at least two SNe within 3 days of explosion per month. To date, YSE has discovered or observed 8.3% of the transient candidates reported to the International Astronomical Union in 2020. We present an overview of YSE, including science goals, survey characteristics, and a summary of our transient discoveries to date.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908..143J,[]
Extremely Energetic Supernova Explosions Embedded in a Massive Circumstellar Medium: The Case of SN 2016aps,"We perform one-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of energetic supernova (SN) ejecta colliding with a massive circumstellar medium (CSM) aimed at explaining SN 2016aps, likely the brightest SN observed to date. SN 2016aps was a superluminous Type IIn SN, which released as much as $rsim 5\times {10}^{51}$ erg of thermal radiation. Our results suggest that the multiband light curve of SN 2016aps is well explained by the collision of a $30\,{M}_{\odot }$ SN ejecta with the explosion energy of 10<SUP>52</SUP> erg and a $\simeq 8\,{M}_{\odot }$ wind-like CSM with the outer radius of 10<SUP>16</SUP> cm, that is, a hypernova explosion embedded in a massive CSM. This finding indicates that very massive stars with initial masses larger than $40\,{M}_{\odot }$ , which supposedly produce highly energetic SNe, occasionally eject their hydrogen-rich envelopes shortly before the core collapse. We suggest that the pulsational pair-instability SNe may provide a natural explanation for the massive CSM and the energetic explosion. We also provide the relations among the peak luminosity, the radiated energy and the rise time for interacting SNe with the kinetic energy of 10<SUP>52</SUP> erg, which can be used for interpreting SN 2016aps-like objects in future surveys.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908...99S,[]
Early-time Light Curves of Type Ia Supernovae Observed with TESS,"We present the early-time light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observed in the first six sectors of Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data. Ten of these SNe were discovered by ASAS-SN, seven by ATLAS, six by ZTF, and one by Gaia. For nine of these objects with sufficient dynamic range (>3.0 mag from detection to peak), we fit power-law models and searched for signatures of companion stars. We found a diversity of early-time light-curve shapes, although most of our sources are consistent with fireball models where the flux increases as ∝t<SUP>2</SUP>. Three SNe displayed a flatter rise with flux ∝t. We did not find any obvious evidence for additional structures, such as multiple power-law components, in the early rising light curves. For assumptions about the SN properties and the observer viewing angle (ejecta mass of 1.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, expansion velocity of 10<SUP>4</SUP> km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, opacity of 0.2 cm<SUP>2</SUP> g<SUP>-1</SUP>, and viewing angle of 45°) and a further assumption that any companion stars would be in Roche lobe overflow, it is possible to place upper limits on the radii of any companion stars. Six of the nine SNe had complete coverage of the early-time light curves, and we placed upper limits on the radii of companion stars of ≲32 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> for these SNe, ≲20 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> for five of the six, and ≲4 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> for two of the six. The small sample size did not allow us to put limits on the occurrence rate of companion stars in the progenitors of SNe Ia. However, we expect that TESS observed enough SNe in its two-year primary mission (26 sectors) to either detect the signature of a large companion (R > 20 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>) or constrain the occurrence rate of such systems, at least for the fiducial SN properties adopted here. We also show that TESS is capable of detecting emission from a 1 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> companion for an SN Ia within 50 Mpc and has a reasonable chance of doing so after about six years.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908...51F,[]
Seventeen Tidal Disruption Events from the First Half of ZTF Survey Observations: Entering a New Era of Population Studies,"While tidal disruption events (TDEs) have long been heralded as laboratories for the study of quiescent black holes, the small number of known TDEs and uncertainties in their emission mechanism have hindered progress toward this promise. Here we present 17 new TDEs that have been detected recently by the Zwicky Transient Facility along with Swift UV and X-ray follow-up observations. Our homogeneous analysis of the optical/UV light curves, including 22 previously known TDEs from the literature, reveals a clean separation of light-curve properties with spectroscopic class. The TDEs with Bowen fluorescence features in their optical spectra have smaller blackbody radii, lower optical luminosities, and higher disruption rates compared to the rest of the sample. The small subset of TDEs that show only helium emission lines in their spectra have the longest rise times, the highest luminosities, and the lowest rates. A high detection rate of Bowen lines in TDEs with small photometric radii could be explained by the high density that is required for this fluorescence mechanism. The stellar debris can provide a source for this dense material. Diffusion of photons through this debris may explain why the rise and fade timescale of the TDEs in our sample are not correlated. We also report, for the first time, the detection of soft X-ray flares from a TDE on ∼day timescales. Based on the fact that the X-ray flares peak at a luminosity similar to the optical/UV blackbody luminosity, we attribute them to brief glimpses through a reprocessing layer that otherwise obscures the inner accretion flow.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...908....4V,[]
Search for Black Hole Merger Families,"The origin, environment, and evolution of stellar-mass black hole (BH) binaries are still a mystery. One of the proposed binary formation mechanisms is manifest in dynamical interactions between multiple BHs. A resulting framework of these dynamical interactions is the so-called hierarchical triple-merger scenario, which happens when three BHs become gravitationally bound, causing two successive BH mergers to occur. In such successive mergers, the BHs involved are directly related to each other, and hence this channel can be directly tested from the properties of the detected binary BH mergers. Here we present a search for hierarchical triple mergers among events within the first and second gravitational-wave transient catalogs of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory/Virgo, the eccentric localization of GW190521, and those found by the IAS-Princeton group. The search includes improved statistical quantification that also accounts for BH spins. We perform our analysis for different upper bounds on the mass distribution of first-generation BHs. Our results demonstrate the importance of the mass distributions' properties for constraining the hierarchical merger scenario. We present the individually significant merger pairs. The search yields interesting candidate families and hints of its future impact.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...907L..48V,[]
An Extraordinary Response of Iron Emission to the Central Outburst in a Tidal Disruption Event Candidate,"Understanding the origin of Fe II emission is important because it is crucial to construct the main sequence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Despite several decades of observational and theoretical effort, the location of the optical iron emitting region and the mechanism responsible for the positive correlation between the Fe II strength and the black hole accretion rate remain open questions. In this Letter, we report the optical Fe II response to the central outburst in PS1-10adi, a candidate tidal disruption event taking place in an AGN at z = 0.203 that has aroused extensive attention. For the first time, we observe that the Fe II response in the rising phase of its central luminosity is significantly more prominent than that in the decline phase, showing a hysteresis effect. We interpret this hysteresis effect as a consequence of the gradual sublimation of the dust grains situating at the inner surface of the torus into gas when the luminosity of the central engine increases. It is the iron element released from the sublimated dust that contributes evidently to the observed Fe II emission. This interpretation, together with the weak response of the Hβ emission as we observe, naturally explains the applicability of relative Fe II strength as a tracer of the Eddington ratio. In addition, optical iron emission of this origin renders the Fe II time lag a potential ""standard candle"" with cosmological implications.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...907L..29H,[]
"Bright, Months-long Stellar Outbursts Announce the Explosion of Interaction-powered Supernovae","Interaction-powered supernovae (SNe) explode within an optically thick circumstellar medium (CSM) that could be ejected during eruptive events. To identify and characterize such pre-explosion outbursts, we produce forced-photometry light curves for 196 interacting SNe, mostly of Type IIn, detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility between early 2018 and 2020 June. Extensive tests demonstrate that we only expect a few false detections among the 70,000 analyzed pre-explosion images after applying quality cuts and bias corrections. We detect precursor eruptions prior to 18 Type IIn SNe and prior to the Type Ibn SN 2019uo. Precursors become brighter and more frequent in the last months before the SN and month-long outbursts brighter than magnitude -13 occur prior to 25% (5-69%, 95% confidence range) of all Type IIn SNe within the final three months before the explosion. With radiative energies of up to 10<SUP>49</SUP> erg, precursors could eject ∼1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of material. Nevertheless, SNe with detected precursors are not significantly more luminous than other SNe IIn, and the characteristic narrow hydrogen lines in their spectra typically originate from earlier, undetected mass-loss events. The long precursor durations require ongoing energy injection, and they could, for example, be powered by interaction or by a continuum-driven wind. Instabilities during the neon- and oxygen-burning phases are predicted to launch precursors in the final years to months before the explosion; however, the brightest precursor is 100 times more energetic than anticipated.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...907...99S,[]
Improving Damped Random Walk Parameters for SDSS Stripe 82 Quasars with Pan-STARRS1,"We use the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1 Survey (Pan-STARRS1, PS1) data to extend the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 quasar light curves. Combining PS1 and SDSS light curves provides a 15 yr baseline for 9248 quasars—5 yr longer than prior studies that used only SDSS. We fit the light curves with the damped random walk (DRW) model—a statistical description of their variability. We correlate the resulting DRW model parameters: asymptotic variability amplitude SF<SUB>∞</SUB>, and characteristic timescale τ, with quasar physical properties—black hole mass, bolometric luminosity, and redshift. Using simulated light curves, we find that a longer baseline allows us to better constrain the DRW parameters. After adding PS1 data, the variability amplitude is a stronger function of the black hole mass and has a weaker dependence on quasar luminosity. In addition, the characteristic timescale τ dependence on quasar luminosity is marginally weaker. We also make predictions for the fidelity of DRW model parameter retrieval when light curves will be further extended with Zwicky Transient Facility and Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time data. Finally, we show how updated DRW parameters offer an independent method of discovering changing-look quasar candidates (CLQSOs). The candidates are outliers in terms of differences in magnitude and scatter between the SDSS and PS1 segments. We identify 40 objects (35 newly reported) with a tenfold increase in the variability timescale between SDSS and SDSS-PS1 data due to a large change in brightness (over 0.5 mag)—characteristic for CLQSOs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...907...96S,[]

"Forbidden hugs in pandemic times. I. Luminous red nova AT 2019zhd, a new merger in M 31","We present the follow-up campaign of the luminous red nova (LRN) <ASTROBJ>AT 2019zhd</ASTROBJ>, the third event of this class observed in <ASTROBJ>M 31</ASTROBJ>. The object was followed by several sky surveys for about five months before the outburst, during which it showed a slow luminosity rise. In this phase, the absolute magnitude ranged from M<SUB>r</SUB> = -2.8 ± 0.2 mag to M<SUB>r</SUB> = -5.6 ± 0.1 mag. Then, over a four to five day period, <ASTROBJ>AT 2019zhd</ASTROBJ> experienced a major brightening, reaching a peak of M<SUB>r</SUB> = -9.61 ± 0.08 mag and an optical luminosity of 1.4 × 10<SUP>39</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. After a fast decline, the light curve settled onto a short-duration plateau in the red bands. Although less pronounced, this feature is reminiscent of the second red maximum observed in other LRNe. This phase was followed by a rapid linear decline in all bands. At maximum, the spectra show a blue continuum with prominent Balmer emission lines. The post-maximum spectra show a much redder continuum, resembling that of an intermediate-type star. In this phase, Hα becomes very weak, Hβ is no longer detectable, and a forest of narrow absorption metal lines now dominate the spectrum. The latest spectra, obtained during the post-plateau decline, show a very red continuum (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ≈ 3000 K) with broad molecular bands of TiO, similar to those of M-type stars. The long-lasting, slow photometric rise observed before the peak resembles that of LRN <ASTROBJ>V1309 Sco</ASTROBJ>, which was interpreted as the signature of the common-envelope ejection. The subsequent outburst is likely due to the gas outflow following a stellar merging event. The inspection of archival HST images taken 22 years before the LRN discovery reveals a faint red source (M<SUB>F555W</SUB> = 0.21 ± 0.14 mag, with F555W - F814W = 2.96 ± 0.12 mag) at the position of <ASTROBJ>AT 2019zhd</ASTROBJ>, which is the most likely quiescent precursor.

"Aims: We demonstrate the great similarity between SN 2020faa and iPTF14hls during the first 6 months, and use this comparison to forecast the evolution of SN 2020faa and to reflect on the less well observed early evolution of iPTF14hls.",,,[]
"Methods: We present and analyse our observational data, consisting mainly of optical LCs from the Zwicky Transient Facility in the gri bands and of a sequence of optical spectra. We construct colour curves and a bolometric lc, and we compare ejecta-velocity and black-body radius evolutions for the two supernovae (SNe) and for more typical Type II SNe.",,,[]
"Results: The LCs show a great similarity with those of iPTF14hls over the first 6 months in luminosity, timescale, and colour. In addition, the spectral evolution of SN 2020faa is that of a Type II SN, although it probes earlier epochs than those available for iPTF14hls.",,,[]
"Conclusions: The similar LC behaviour is suggestive of SN 2020faa being a new iPTF14hls. We present these observations now to advocate follow-up observations, since most of the more striking evolution of SN iPTF14hls came later, with LC undulations and a spectacular longevity. On the other hand, for SN 2020faa we have better constraints on the explosion epoch than we had for iPTF14hls, and we have been able to spectroscopically monitor it from earlier phases than was done for the more famous sibling.",,,[]

Research on the readout noise suppression method for digital correlated double sampling,"As the areas of CCD detectors and CCD mosaics have become larger and larger, the number of readout channels in astronomical cameras has increased accordingly to keep the image readout time within an acceptable range. For the large area cameras or the mosaic cameras, the analog Correlated Double Sampling (aCDS) circuit used in traditional astronomical cameras for suppressing readout noise is difficult to integrate into the camera controllers within the constraints of the space and energy consumption. Recently, digital CDS (dCDS) technology has been developed to solve this problem, which also offers novel analysis and noise suppression methods. In this study, a mathematical model is presented to conveniently analyze the frequency characteristic of a dCDS circuit, which is then simulated by a numerical method for investigating the noise suppression capability with different sampling weights. Importantly, using this model, the extreme point with lowest readout noise can be predicted for a certain dCDS model; and for a specific CCD readout frequency, readout noise can be suppressed by selecting the proper dCDS model. A testing system is then constructed for validating the efficiency of the proposed method.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021RAA....21...13D,[]
Direct Determination of Supermassive Black Hole Properties with Gravitational-Wave Radiation from Surrounding Stellar-Mass Black Hole Binaries,"A significant number of stellar-mass black-hole (BH) binaries may merge in galactic nuclei or in the surrounding gas disks. With purposed space-borne gravitational-wave observatories, we may use such a binary as a signal carrier to probe modulations induced by a central supermassive BH (SMBH), which further allows us to place constraints on the SMBH's properties. We show in particular the de Sitter precession of the inner stellar-mass binary's orbital angular momentum (AM) around the AM of the outer orbit will be detectable if the precession period is comparable to the duration of observation, typically a few years. Once detected, the precession can be combined with the Doppler shift arising from the outer orbital motion to determine the mass of the SMBH and the outer orbital separation individually and each with percent-level accuracy. If we further assume a joint detection by space-borne and ground-based detectors, the detectability threshold could be extended to a precession period of ∼100 yr .",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PhRvL.126b1101Y,[]
Cosmology requirements on supernova photometric redshift systematics for the Rubin LSST and Roman Space Telescope,"Some million type Ia supernovae (SN) will be discovered and monitored during upcoming wide area time domain surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). For cosmological use, accurate redshifts are needed among other characteristics; however the vast majority of the SN will not have spectroscopic redshifts, even for their host galaxies, only photometric redshifts. We assess the redshift systematic control necessary for robust cosmology. Based on the photometric vs true redshift relation generated by machine learning applied to a simulation of 500,000 galaxies as observed with LSST quality, we quantify requirements on systematics in the mean relation and in the outlier fraction and deviance so as not to bias dark energy cosmological inference. Certain redshift ranges are particularly sensitive, motivating spectroscopic followup of SN at z ≲0.2 and around z ≈0.5 - 0.6 . Including Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope near infrared bands in the simulation, we reanalyze the constraints, finding improvements at high redshift but little at the low redshifts where systematics lead to strong cosmology bias. We identify a complete spectroscopic survey of SN host galaxies for z ≲0.2 as a highly favored element for robust SN cosmology.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PhRvD.103b3524M,[]
Processing GOTO data with the Rubin Observatory LSST Science Pipelines I: Production of coadded frames,"The past few decades have seen the burgeoning of wide-field, high-cadence surveys, the most formidable of which will be the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) to be conducted by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. So new is the field of systematic time-domain survey astronomy; however, that major scientific insights will continue to be obtained using smaller, more flexible systems than the LSST. One such example is the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) whose primary science objective is the optical follow-up of gravitational wave events. The amount and rate of data production by GOTO and other wide-area, high-cadence surveys presents a significant challenge to data processing pipelines which need to operate in near-real time to fully exploit the time domain. In this study, we adapt the Rubin Observatory LSST Science Pipelines to process GOTO data, thereby exploring the feasibility of using this `off-the-shelf' pipeline to process data from other wide-area, high-cadence surveys. In this paper, we describe how we use the LSST Science Pipelines to process raw GOTO frames to ultimately produce calibrated coadded images and photometric source catalogues. After comparing the measured astrometry and photometry to those of matched sources from PanSTARRS DR1, we find that measured source positions are typically accurate to subpixel levels, and that measured L-band photometries are accurate to $∼50$ mmag at $m_L∼16$ and $∼200$ mmag at $m_L∼18$. These values compare favourably to those obtained using GOTO's primary, in-house pipeline, GOTOPHOTO, in spite of both pipelines having undergone further development and improvement beyond the implementations used in this study. Finally, we release a generic `obs package' that others can build upon, should they wish to use the LSST Science Pipelines to process data from other facilities.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASA...38....4M,[]
High cadence optical transient searches using drift scan imaging II: Event rate upper limits on optical transients of duration <21 ms and magnitude <6.6,"We have realised a simple prototype system to perform searches for short timescale optical transients, utilising the novel drift scan imaging technique described by Tingay (2020). We used two coordinated and aligned cameras, with an overlap field of view of approximately 3.7 deg$^2$, to capture over $34 000 × 5$ second images during approximately 24 h of observing. The system is sensitive to optical transients, due to an effective exposure time per pixel of 21 ms, brighter than a V magnitude of 6.6. In our 89.7 deg$^2$ h of observations, we find no candidate astronomical transients, giving an upper limit to the rate of these transients of 0.8 per deg$^2$ per day, competitive with other experiments of this type. The system is triggered by reflections from satellites and various instrumental effects, which are easily identifiable due to the two camera system. The next step in the development of this promising technique is to move to a system with larger apertures and wider fields of view.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PASA...38....1T,[]
Photometric study for near-Earth asteroid (155140) 2005 UD,"The Apollo-type near-Earth asteroid (155140) 2005 UD is thought to be a member of the Phaethon-Geminid meteor stream Complex (PGC). Its basic physical parameters are important for unveiling its origin and its relationship to the other PGC members as well as to the Geminid stream. Adopting the Lommel-Seeliger ellipsoid method and H, G<SUB>1</SUB>, G<SUB>2</SUB> phase function, we carry out spin, shape, and phase curve inversion using the photometric data of 2005 UD. The data consists of 11 new lightcurves, 3 lightcurves downloaded from the Minor Planet Center, and 288 sparse data points downloaded from the Zwicky Transient Facility database.

Gravitational-wave physics and astronomy in the 2020s and 2030s,"The 100 years since the publication of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity saw significant development of the understanding of the theory, the identification of potential astrophysical sources of sufficiently strong gravitational waves and development of key technologies for gravitational-wave detectors. In 2015, the first gravitational-wave signals were detected by the two US Advanced LIGO instruments. In 2017, Advanced LIGO and the European Advanced Virgo detectors pinpointed a binary neutron star coalescence that was also seen across the electromagnetic spectrum.

Optical follow-up of the neutron star-black hole mergers S200105ae and S200115j,"LIGO and Virgo's third observing run revealed the first neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger candidates in gravitational waves.

The joint gravitational wave and electromagnetic detection of an NSBH merger could be used to constrain the equation of state of dense nuclear matter<SUP>3</SUP>, and independently measure the local expansion rate of the Universe<SUP>4</SUP>. Here, we present the optical follow-up and analysis of two of the only three high-significance NSBH merger candidates detected to date, S200105ae and S200115j, with the Zwicky Transient Facility<SUP>5</SUP>. The Zwicky Transient Facility observed ~48% of S200105ae and ~22% of S200115j's localization probabilities, with observations sensitive to kilonovae brighter than -17.5 mag fading at 0.5 mag d<SUP>-1</SUP> in the g- and r-bands; extensive searches and systematic follow-up of candidates did not yield a viable counterpart. We present state-of-the-art kilonova models tailored to NSBH systems that place constraints on the ejecta properties of these NSBH mergers.

ZZ Piscis Austrinus (ZZ PsA): a bright red nova progenitor and the instability mass ratio of contact binary stars,"ZZ Piscis Austrinus (ZZ PsA) is a neglected bright southern contact binary system with maximum V magnitude of 9.26.

The primary has a mass of 1.213 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> in keeping with its reported spectral class of F6. In order to determine if ZZ PsA is a merger candidate, we outline the current status regarding the instability mass ratio and develop new relationship linking the mass of the primary to the instability mass ratio of the system and the degree of contact.

PS15cey and PS17cke: prospective candidates from the Pan-STARRS Search for kilonovae,"Time domain astronomy was revolutionized with the discovery of the first kilonova, AT2017gfo, in August 2017, which was associated with the gravitational wave signal GW170817. Since this event, numerous wide-field surveys have been optimizing search strategies to maximize their efficiency of detecting these fast and faint transients. With the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS), we have been conducting a volume-limited survey for intrinsically faint and fast-fading events to a distance of D ≃ 200 Mpc. Two promising candidates have been identified from this archival search, with sparse data - PS15cey and PS17cke. Here, we present more detailed analysis and discussion of their nature. We observe that PS15cey was a luminous, fast-declining transient at 320 Mpc. Models of BH-NS mergers with a very stiff equation of state could possibly reproduce the luminosity and decline but the physical parameters are extreme. A more likely scenario is that this was an AT2018kzr-like merger event. PS17cke was a faint and fast-declining event at 15 Mpc. We explore several explosion scenarios of this transient including models of it as a NS-NS and BH-NS merger, the outburst of a massive luminous star, and compare it against other known fast-fading transients. Although there is uncertainty in the explosion scenario due to difficulty in measuring the explosion epoch, we find PS17cke to be a plausible kilonova candidate from the model comparisons.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.500.4213M,[]
Discovery of a candidate binary supermassive black hole in a periodic quasar from circumbinary accretion variability,"Binary supermassive black holes (BSBHs) are expected to be a generic byproduct from hierarchical galaxy formation. The final coalescence of BSBHs is thought to be the loudest gravitational wave (GW) siren, yet no confirmed BSBH is known in the GW-dominated regime. While periodic quasars have been proposed as BSBH candidates, the physical origin of the periodicity has been largely uncertain. Here, we report discovery of a periodicity (p = 1607 ± 7 d) at 99.95 per cent significance (with a global p value of ~10<SUP>-3</SUP> accounting for the look elsewhere effect) in the optical light curves of a redshift 1.53 quasar, SDSS J025214.67-002813.7. Combining archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey data with new, sensitive imaging from the Dark Energy Survey, the total ~20-yr time baseline spans ~4.6 cycles of the observed 4.4-yr (rest frame 1.7-yr) periodicity. The light curves are best fit by a bursty model predicted by hydrodynamic simulations of circumbinary accretion discs. The periodicity is likely caused by accretion rate modulation by a milli-parsec BSBH emitting GWs, dynamically coupled to the circumbinary accretion disc. A bursty hydrodynamic variability model is statistically preferred over a smooth, sinusoidal model expected from relativistic Doppler boost, a kinematic effect proposed for PG1302-102. Furthermore, the frequency dependence of the variability amplitudes disfavours Doppler boost, lending independent support to the circumbinary accretion variability hypothesis. Given our detection rate of one BSBH candidate from circumbinary accretion variability out of 625 quasars, it suggests that future large, sensitive synoptic surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time may be able to detect hundreds to thousands of candidate BSBHs from circumbinary accretion with direct implications for Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.500.4025L,[]
The effect of a magnetic field on the dynamics of debris discs around white dwarfs,"Observational estimates of the lifetimes and inferred accretion rates from debris discs around polluted white dwarfs are often inconsistent with the predictions of models of shielded Poynting-Robertson drag on the dust particles in the discs. Moreover, many cool polluted white dwarfs do not show any observational evidence of accompanying discs. This may be explained, in part, if the debris discs had shorter lifetimes and higher accretion rates than predicted by Poynting-Robertson drag alone. We consider the role of a magnetic field on tidally disrupted diamagnetic debris and its subsequent effect on the formation, evolution, and accretion rate of a debris disc. We estimate that magnetic field strengths greater than ∼10 kG may decrease the time needed for circularization and the disc lifetimes by several orders of magnitude and increase the associated accretion rates by a similar factor, relative to Poynting-Robertson drag. We suggest some polluted white dwarfs may host magnetic fields below the typical detectable limit and that these fields may account for a proportion of polluted white dwarfs with missing debris discs. We also suggest that diamagnetic drag may account for the higher accretion rate estimates among polluted white dwarfs that cannot be predicted solely by Poynting-Robertson drag and find a dependence on magnetic field strength, orbital pericentre distance, and particle size on predicted disc lifetimes and accretion rates.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.500.2986H,[]
Discovery and follow-up of ASASSN-19dj: an X-ray and UV luminous TDE in an extreme post-starburst galaxy,"We present observations of ASASSN-19dj, a nearby tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered in the post-starburst galaxy KUG 0810+227 by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) at a distance of d ≃ 98 Mpc. We observed ASASSN-19dj from -21 to 392 d relative to peak ultraviolet (UV)/optical emission using high-cadence, multiwavelength spectroscopy and photometry. From the ASAS-SN g-band data, we determine that the TDE began to brighten on 2019 February 6.8 and for the first 16 d the rise was consistent with a flux ∝t<SUP>2</SUP> power law. ASASSN-19dj peaked in the UV/optical on 2019 March 6.5 (MJD = 58548.5) at a bolometric luminosity of L = (6.2 ± 0.2) × 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Initially remaining roughly constant in X-rays and slowly fading in the UV/optical, the X-ray flux increased by over an order of magnitude ~225 d after peak, resulting from the expansion of the X-ray emitting region. The late-time X-ray emission is well fitted by a blackbody with an effective radius of ~1 × 10<SUP>12</SUP> cm and a temperature of ~6 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> K. The X-ray hardness ratio becomes softer after brightening and then returns to a harder state as the X-rays fade. Analysis of Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey images reveals a nuclear outburst roughly 14.5 yr earlier with a smooth decline and a luminosity of L<SUB>V</SUB> ≥ 1.4 × 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, although the nature of the flare is unknown.

In silico design of a new Zn-triazole based metal-organic framework for CO<SUB>2</SUB> and H<SUB>2</SUB>O adsorption,"In search for future good adsorbents for CO<SUB>2</SUB> capture, a nitrogen-rich triazole-type Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) is proposed based on the rational design and theoretical molecular simulations. The structure of the proposed MOF, named Zinc Triazolate based Framework (ZTF), is obtained by replacing the amine-organic linker of MAF-66 by a triazole, and its structural parameters are deduced. We used grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations based on generic classical force fields to correctly predict the adsorption isotherms of CO<SUB>2</SUB> and H<SUB>2</SUB>O. For water adsorption in MAF-66 and ZTF, simulations revealed that the strong hydrogen bonding interactions of water with the N atoms of triazole rings of the frameworks are the main driving forces for the high adsorption uptake of water. We also show that the proposed ZTF porous material exhibits exceptional high CO<SUB>2</SUB> uptake capacity at low pressure, better than MAF-66. Moreover, the nature of the interactions between CO<SUB>2</SUB> and the MAF-66 and ZTF surface cavities was examined at the microscopic level. Computations show that the interactions occur at two different sites, consisting of Lewis acid-Lewis base interactions and hydrogen bonding, together with obvious electrostatic interactions. In addition, we investigated the influence of the presence of H<SUB>2</SUB>O molecules on the CO<SUB>2</SUB> adsorption on the ZTF MOF. GCMC simulations reveal that the addition of H<SUB>2</SUB>O molecules leads to an enhancement of the CO<SUB>2</SUB> adsorption at very low pressures but a reduction of this CO<SUB>2</SUB> adsorption at higher pressures.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021JChPh.154b4303D,[]
Binary neutron star mergers: a multi-messenger revolution,"On 17 August 2017, less than two years after the direct detection of gravitational radiation from the merger of two ~30 Msun black holes, a binary neutron star merger was identified as the source of a gravitational wave signal of ~100 s duration that occurred at less than 50 Mpc from Earth. A short GRB was independently identified in the same sky area by the Fermi and INTEGRAL satellites for high energy astrophysics, which turned out to be associated with the gravitational event. Prompt follow-up observations at all wavelengths led first to the detection of an optical and infrared source located in the spheroidal galaxy NGC4993 and, with a delay of ~10 days, to the detection of radio and X-ray signals. This paper revisits these observations and focusses on the early optical/infrared source, which was thermal in nature and powered by the radioactive decay of the unstable isotopes of elements synthesized via rapid neutron capture during the merger and in the phases immediately following it. The far-reaching consequences of this event for cosmic nucleosynthesis and for the history of heavy elements formation in the Universe are also illustrated.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021FrASS...7..108P,[]
Molecular-level behavior of imidazolium-based ionic liquid mixtures,"Understanding the molecular-level organization of anions and cations in a mixture of different ionic liquids (ILs) is challenging, but it can be very important for designing solvents and IL-based membrane materials.

We observe very strong underlying molecular-level migrations in these mixtures, and this tends to mainly involve the anion species. As compared to the systems with a single anion, the mixed anions lead to large increases/decreases in the radial distribution function peak heights, whereas the cation mixing is relatively benign. The [BF<SUB>4</SUB><SUP>-</SUP>] anions have a strong tendency to displace the [Tf<SUB>2</SUB>N<SUP>-</SUP>] anions in the mixtures, and this is seen with respect to both [BMIM<SUP>+</SUP>] and [ZMIM<SUP>+</SUP>].",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ChEnS.22916073S,[]
GW190521 May Be an Intermediate-mass Ratio Inspiral,"GW190521 is the first confident observation of a binary black hole merger with total mass $M 100\,{M}_{\odot }$ . Given the lack of observational constraints at these masses, we analyze GW190521 considering two different priors for the binary's masses: uniform in mass ratio and source-frame total mass, and uniform in source-frame component masses. For the uniform in mass-ratio prior, we find that the component masses are ${m}_{1}^{\mathrm{src}}={168}_{-61}^{+15}\,{M}_{\odot }$ and ${m}_{2}^{\mathrm{src}}={16}_{-3}^{+33}\,{M}_{\odot }$ . The uniform in component-mass prior yields a bimodal posterior distribution. There is a low-mass-ratio mode ( $q 4$ ) with ${m}_{1}^{\mathrm{src}}={100}_{-18}^{+17}\,{M}_{\odot }$ and ${m}_{2}^{\mathrm{src}}={57}_{-16}^{+17}\,{M}_{\odot }$ and a high-mass-ratio mode ( $q\geqslant 4$ ) with ${m}_{1}^{\mathrm{src}}={166}_{-35}^{+16}\,{M}_{\odot }$ and ${m}_{2}^{\mathrm{src}}={16}_{-3}^{+14}\,{M}_{\odot }$ . Although the two modes have nearly equal posterior probability, the maximum-likelihood parameters are in the high-mass-ratio mode, with ${m}_{1}^{\mathrm{src}}=171\,{M}_{\odot }$ and ${m}_{2}^{\mathrm{src}}=16\,{M}_{\odot }$ , and a signal-to-noise ratio of 16. These results are consistent with the proposed ""mass gap"" produced by pair-instability in supernovae. Our results differ from those published in Abbott et al. We find that a combination of the prior used and the constraints applied may have prevented that analysis from sampling the high-mass-ratio mode. An accretion flare in AGN J124942.3+344929 was observed in possible coincidence with GW190521 by the Zwicky Transient Facility. We report parameters assuming a common origin; however, the spatial agreement of GW190521 and the electromagnetic flare alone does not provide convincing evidence for the association ( $\mathrm{ln}{ \mathcal B }rsim -4$ ).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...907L...9N,[]
Deep Optical Observations Contemporaneous with Emission from the Periodic FRB 180916.J0158+65,"We present deep Apache Point Observatory optical observations within seconds of radio emission from the periodic fast radio burst (FRB) 180916.J0158+65 obtained on 2020 September 3. FRB 180916.J0158+65 is located in a nearby spiral galaxy 150 Mpc away and has an ""active phase"" with a well-measured period of approximately 16.3 days.

The Early Discovery of SN 2017ahn: Signatures of Persistent Interaction in a Fast-declining Type II Supernova,"We present high-cadence, comprehensive data on the nearby (D ≃ 33 Mpc) Type II supernova (SN II) 2017ahn, discovered within about one day of the explosion, from the very early phases after explosion to the nebular phase. The observables of SN 2017ahn show a significant evolution over the ≃470 days of our follow-up campaign, first showing prominent, narrow Balmer lines and other high-ionization features purely in emission (i.e., flash spectroscopy features), which progressively fade and lead to a spectroscopic evolution similar to that of more canonical SNe II. Over the same period, the decline of the light curves in all bands is fast, resembling the photometric evolution of linearly declining H-rich core-collapse SNe. The modeling of the light curves and early flash spectra suggests that a complex circumstellar medium surrounds the progenitor star at the time of explosion, with a first dense shell produced during the very late stages of its evolution that is swept up by the rapidly expanding ejecta within the first ∼6 days of the SN evolution, while signatures of interaction are observed also at later phases. Hydrodynamical models support the scenario in which linearly declining SNe II are predicted to arise from massive yellow super- or hypergiants depleted of most of their hydrogen layers.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...907...52T,[]
Neutron Star Mergers in Active Galactic Nucleus Accretion Disks: Cocoon and Ejecta Shock Breakouts,"Neutron star mergers are believed to occur in accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Here we show that a putative jet launched from the merger of a binary neutron star (BNS) or a neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger occurring at the migration trap in an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk would be choked. The jet energy is deposited within the disk materials to power a hot cocoon. The cocoon is energetic enough to break out from the AGN disk and produce a bright X-ray shock breakout transient peaking at ∼0.15 days after the merger. The peak luminosity is estimated as $\sim {10}^{46}\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ , which can be discovered by the Einstein Probe from $z\lesssim 0.5$ . Later on, the nonrelativistic ejecta launched from the merger would break out the disk, powering an X-ray/UV flare peaking at ∼0.5 days after the merger. This second shock breakout signal may be detected by UV transient searches. The cocoon cooling emission and kilonova emission are outshone by the disk emission and are difficult to detect. Future joint observations of gravitational waves from BNS/NSBH mergers and associated two shock breakout signatures can provide strong support for the compact binary coalescence formation channel in AGN disks.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...906L..11Z,[]
Can the Helium-detonation Model Explain the Observed Diversity of Type Ia Supernovae?,"We study a sample of 16 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) having both spectroscopic and photometric observations within 2-3 days after the first light. The early B - V colors of such a sample tend to show a continuous distribution. For objects with normal ejecta velocity (NV), the C II λ6580 feature is always visible in the early spectra, while it is absent or very weak in the high-velocity (HV) counterpart. Moreover, the velocities of the detached high-velocity features (HVFs) of the Ca II near-IR triplet (CaIR3) above the photosphere are found to be much higher in HV objects than in NV objects, with typical values exceeding 30,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> at 2-3 days. We further analyze the relation between the velocity shift of late-time [Fe II] lines (v<SUB>[Fe II]</SUB>) and host galaxy mass. We find that all HV objects have redshifted v<SUB>[Fe II]</SUB>, while NV objects have both blue- and redshifted v<SUB>[Fe II]</SUB>. It is interesting to point out that the objects with redshifted v<SUB>[Fe II]</SUB> are all located in massive galaxies, implying that HV and a portion of NV objects may have similar progenitor metallicities and explosion mechanisms. We propose that, with a geometric/projected effect, the He-detonation model may account for the similarity in birthplace environment and the differences seen in some SNe Ia, including B - V colors, C II features, CaIR3 HVFs at early times, and v<SUB>[Fe II]</SUB> in the nebular phase. Nevertheless, some features predicted by He-detonation simulation, such as the rapidly decreasing light curve, deviate from the observations, and some NV objects with blueshifted nebular v<SUB>[Fe II]</SUB> may involve other explosion mechanisms.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...906...99L,[]
Supernova 2018cuf: A Type IIP Supernova with a Slow Fall from Plateau,"We present multiband photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2018cuf, a Type IIP (""P"" for plateau) supernova (SN) discovered by the Distance Less Than 40 Mpc Survey within 24 hr of explosion. SN 2018cuf appears to be a typical SN IIP, with an absolute V-band magnitude of -16.73 ± 0.32 at maximum and a decline rate of 0.21 ± 0.05 mag/50 days during the plateau phase. The distance of the object was constrained to be 41.8 ± 5.7 Mpc by using the expanding photosphere method. We used spectroscopic and photometric observations from the first year after the explosion to constrain the progenitor of SN 2018cuf using both hydrodynamic light-curve modeling and late-time spectroscopic modeling. The progenitor of SN 2018cuf was most likely a red supergiant of about 14.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> that produced 0.04 ± 0.01 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> <SUP>56</SUP>Ni during the explosion. We also found ∼0.07 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of circumstellar material (CSM) around the progenitor is needed to fit the early light curves, where the CSM may originate from presupernova outbursts. During the plateau phase, high-velocity features at ∼11,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> were detected in both the optical and near-infrared spectra, supporting the possibility that the ejecta were interacting with some CSM. A very shallow slope during the postplateau phase was also observed, and it is likely due to a low degree of nickel mixing or the relatively high nickel mass in the SN.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...906...56D,[]
AT 2020iko: A WZ Sge-type Dwarf Nova Candidate with an Anomalous Precursor Event,"The ongoing Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey is generating a massive alert rate from a variety of optical transients and variable stars, which are being filtered down to subsets meeting user-specified criteria by broker systems such as the Arizona-NOIRLab Temporal Analysis and Response to Events System (ANTARES). In a beta implementation of the algorithm of Soraisam et al. on ANTARES, we flagged AT 2020iko from the ZTF real-time alert stream as an anomalous source. This source is located close to a red extended Sloan Digital Sky Survey source. In the first few epochs of detection, it exhibited a V-shaped brightness profile, preceded by nondetections both in ZTF and in the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae extending to 2014. Its full light curve shows a precursor event, followed by a main superoutburst and at least two rebrightenings. A low-resolution spectrum of this source points to a dwarf nova (DN) nature. Although some of the features of AT 2020iko indicate an SU UMa-type DN, its large amplitude, presence of rebrightenings, and inferred supercycle period of ≥6 yr are in favor of AT 2020iko being a new WZ Sge-type DN candidate, a subset of rare DNe consisting of extreme mass-ratio (<0.1) binaries with an orbital period around the period minimum. The precusor event of AT 2020iko brightened by 6.5 mag, while its decay spanned 3-5 mag. We speculate this superoutburst is associated with a less expanded accretion disk than in typical superoutbursts in WZ Sge systems, with the large depth of the precursor decay implying an extremely small mass ratio. To the best of our knowledge, such a precursor event has not been recorded for any DN. This result serves to demonstrate the efficacy of our real-time anomaly search algorithm.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....161...15S,[]

"Methods: We analysed the light curves using various statistical tests, fitting and cross-correlation techniques, and methods for the search for periodicity. We examined the colour-magnitude diagrams before and after the corresponding light curves were corrected for the long-term variations.",,,[]
"Results: Our intra-night monitoring, supplemented with literature data, result in a low duty cycle of ∼(10-18)%. In April 2019, we recorded a flare, which marks the brightest state of <ASTROBJ>PG 1553+113</ASTROBJ> for the period from 2005 to 2019: R ≃ 13.2 mag. This flare is found to show a clockwise spectral hysteresis loop on its VR colour-magnitude diagram and a time lag in the sense that the V-band variations lead the R-band ones. We obtain estimates of the radius, the magnetic field strength, and the electron energy that characterize the emission region related to the flare. We find a median period of (2.21 ± 0.04) years using the historical light curves. In addition, we detect a secondary period of about 210 days using the historical light curves corrected for the long-term variations. We briefly discuss the possible origin of this period.",,,[]

Multimessenger constraints on the neutron-star equation of state and the Hubble constant,"Observations of neutron-star mergers with distinct messengers, including gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals, can be used to study the behavior of matter denser than an atomic nucleus and to measure the expansion rate of the Universe as quantified by the Hubble constant. We performed a joint analysis of the gravitational-wave event GW170817 with its electromagnetic counterparts AT2017gfo and GRB170817A, and the gravitational-wave event GW190425, both originating from neutron-star mergers. We combined these with previous measurements of pulsars using x-ray and radio observations, and nuclear-theory computations using chiral effective field theory, to constrain the neutron-star equation of state. We found that the radius of a 1.4-solar mass neutron star is 11.75-0.81+0.86 km at 90% confidence and the Hubble constant is 66.2-4.2+4.4 at 1σ uncertainty.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020Sci...370.1450D,[]
Search for high energy γ-rays from the direction of the candidate electromagnetic counterpart to the binary black hole merger gravitational-wave event S190521g,"The gravitational-wave event S190521g - a likely binary black hole merger in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus - was accompanied by an optical counterpart. Such dense environments around luminous energy release regions are favorable for high energy γ-ray production. We report on a search for high energy γ-rays from the direction of the candidate electromagnetic counterpart to the S190521g event using publicly-available data of the Fermi-LAT space γ-ray telescope. No significant signal was found. We present upper limits on the spectral energy distribution of the source in the 100 MeV-300 GeV energy range.

Black hole-neutron star coalescence: Effects of the neutron star spin on jet launching and dynamical ejecta mass,"Black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers are thought to be sources of gravitational waves (GWs) with coincident electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. To further probe whether these systems are viable progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) and kilonovas, and how one may use (the lack of) EM counterparts associated with LIGO/Virgo candidate BHNS GW events to sharpen parameter estimation, we study the impact of neutron star spin in BHNS mergers. Using dynamical spacetime magnetohydrodynamic simulations of BHNSs initially on a quasicircular orbit, we survey configurations that differ in the BH spin (a<SUB>BH</SUB>/M<SUB>BH</SUB>=0 and 0.75), the NS spin (a<SUB>NS</SUB>/M<SUB>NS</SUB>=-0.17 , 0, 0.23, and 0.33), and the binary mass ratio (q ≡M<SUB>BH</SUB>:M<SUB>NS</SUB>=3 ∶1 and 5 ∶1 ). The general trend we find is that increasing the NS prograde spin increases both the rest mass of the accretion disk onto the remnant black hole, and the rest mass of dynamically ejected matter. By a time Δ t ∼3500 - 5500 M ∼88 - 138 (M<SUB>NS</SUB>/1.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) ms after the peak gravitational-wave amplitude, a magnetically driven jet is launched only for q =3 ∶1 regardless of the initial NS spin. The lifetime of the jets [Δ t ∼0.5 - 0.8 (M<SUB>NS</SUB>/1.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) s ] and their outgoing Poynting luminosity [L<SUB>Poyn</SUB>∼10<SUP>51.5 ±0.5</SUP> erg /s ] are consistent with typical SGRBs' luminosities and expectations from the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. By the time we terminate our simulations, we do not observe either an outflow or a large-scale magnetic-field collimation for the other systems we consider. The mass range of dynamically ejected matter is 10<SUP>-4.5</SUP>- 10<SUP>-2</SUP>(M<SUB>NS</SUB>/1.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) M<SUB>⊙</SUB> , which can power kilonovas with peak bolometric luminosities L<SUB>knova</SUB>∼10<SUP>40</SUP>- 10<SUP>41.4</SUP> erg /s with rise times ≲6.5 h and potentially detectable by the LSST.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhRvD.102l4077R,[]
Modified gravity and the black hole mass gap,"We pioneer the black hole mass gap as a powerful new tool for constraining modified gravity theories. These theories predict fifth forces that alter the structure and evolution of population-III stars, exacerbating the pair-instability. This results in the formation of lighter astrophysical black holes and lowers both the upper and lower edges of the mass gap. These effects are explored using detailed numerical simulations to derive quantitative predictions that can be used as theoretical inputs for Bayesian data analysis. We discuss detection strategies in light of current and upcoming data as well as complications that may arise due to environmental screening. To demonstrate the constraining power of the mass gap, we present a novel test of the strong equivalence principle where we apply our results to an analysis of the first ten LIGO/Virgo binary black hole merger events to obtain a 7% bound on the relative difference between the gravitational constant experienced by baryonic matter, and that experienced by black holes, Δ G /G . The recent GW190521 event resulting from two black holes with masses in the canonical mass gap can be explained by modified gravity if the event originated from an unscreened galaxy where the strength of gravity is either enhanced or reduced by ∼30 % relative to its strength in the Solar System.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhRvD.102l4018S,[]
Impact of neutrino pair-production rates in core-collapse supernovae,"In this paper, we present a careful study on the impact of neutrino pair-production on core-collapse supernovae via spherically-symmetric, general-relativistic simulations of two different massive star progenitors with energy-dependent neutrino transport. We explore the impact and consequences of both the underlying microphysics and the implementation in the radiation transport algorithms on the supernova evolution, neutrino signal properties, and the explosion dynamics. We consider the two dominant neutrino pair-production processes found in supernovae, electron-positron annihilation as well as nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung in combination with both a simplified and a complete treatment of the processes in the radiation transport algorithms. We find that the use of the simplified prescription quantitatively impacts the neutrino signal at the 10% level and potentially the supernova dynamics, as we show for the case of a zero-metallicity, 9.6 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> progenitor. We also show that the choice of nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung interaction can also have a quantitative impact on the neutrino signal. A self-consistent treatment with state-of-the-art microphysics is suggested for precision simulations of core collapse, however the simplified treatment explored here is both computationally less demanding and results in a qualitatively similar evolution.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhRvD.102l3015B,[]
Spin and eccentricity evolution in triple systems: From the Lidov-Kozai interaction to the final merger of the inner binary,"We study the spin and eccentricity evolution of black-hole (BH) binaries that are perturbed by tertiary masses and experience the Lidov-Kozai (LK) excitation. We focus on three aspects. First, we study the spin-orbit alignment of the inner binary following the approach outlined by Antonini et al. [Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 480, L58 (2018), 10.1093/mnrasl/sly126] and Liu and Lai [Astrophys. J. 863, 68 (2018), 10.3847/1538-4357/aad09f], yet allowing the spins to have random initial orientations. We confirm the existence of a dynamical attractor that drives the spin-orbit angle at the end of the LK evolution to a value given by the initial angle between the spin and the outer orbital angular momentum (instead of to a specific value of the effective spin). Second, we follow the (inner) binary's evolution further to the merger to study the final spin-spin alignment. We generalize the effective potential theory to include orbital eccentricity, which allows us to efficiently evolve the system in the early inspiral stages. We further find that the spin-spin and spin-orbit alignments are correlated and the correlation is determined by the initial spin-orbit angle. For systems with the spin vectors initially in the orbital plane, the final spins strongly disfavor an aligned configuration and could thus lead to a greater value of the GW recoil than a uniform spin-spin alignment would predict. Lastly, we study the maximum eccentricity excitation that can be achieved during the LK process, including the effects of gravitational-wave radiation. We find that when the tertiary mass is a supermassive BH and the inner binary is massive, then even with the maximum LK excitation, the residual eccentricity is typically less than 0.1 when the binary's orbital frequency reaches 10 Hz, and a decihertz detector would be necessary to follow such a system's orbital evolution.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhRvD.102l3009Y,[]
Convex Shape and Rotation Model of Lucy Target (11351) Leucus from Lightcurves and Occultations,"We report new photometric lightcurve observations of the Lucy Mission target (11351) Leucus acquired during the 2017, 2018, and 2019 apparitions. We use these data in combination with stellar occultations captured during five epochs to determine the sidereal rotation period, the spin axis orientation, a convex shape model, the absolute scale of the object, its geometric albedo, and a model of the photometric properties of the target. We find that Leucus is a prograde rotator with a spin axis located within a sky-projected radius of 3° (1σ) from J2000 Ecliptic coordinates (λ = 208°, β = +77°) or J2000 Equatorial Coordinates (R.A. = 248°, decl. = +58°). The sidereal period is refined to P<SUB>sid</SUB> = 445.683 ± 0.007 h. The convex shape model is irregular, with maximum dimensions of 60.8, 39.1, and 27.8 km. The convex model accounts for global features of the occultation silhouettes, although minor deviations suggest that local and global concavities are present. We determine a geometric albedo of p<SUB>V</SUB> = 0.043 ± 0.002. The derived phase curve supports a D-type classification for Leucus.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PSJ.....1...73M,[]
Seeing-limited Imaging Sky Surveys—Small versus Large Telescopes,"Typically large telescope construction and operation costs scale up faster than their collecting area. This slows scientific progress, making it expensive and complicated to increase telescope size. We review the argument that a metric that represents the capability of an imaging survey telescopes, and that captures a wide range of science objectives, is the telescope grasp—the amount of volume of space in which a standard candle is detectable per unit time. We show that in a homogeneous Euclidean universe, and in the background-noise dominated limit, the grasp is: ${ \mathcal G }\propto {\rm{\Omega }}{A}_{\mathrm{eff}}^{3/4}{\sigma }^{-3/2}{t}_{{\rm{E}}}^{3/4}/({t}_{{\rm{E}}}+{t}_{{\rm{D}}})$ , where Ω is the telescope field of view, A<SUB>eff</SUB> is the effective collecting area of the telescope, σ is the instrumental or atmospheric seeing or the pixel-size, whichever dominates, t<SUB>E</SUB> is the exposure time, and t<SUB>D</SUB> is the dead time. In this case, the optimal exposure time is three times the dead time. We also introduce a related metric we call the information-content grasp, which summarizes the variance of all sources observed by the telescope per unit time. We show that, in the background-noise dominated regime, the information-content grasp scales like the grasp. For seeing-dominated sky surveys, in terms of grasp, étendue, or collecting-area optimization, recent technological advancements make it more cost effective to construct multiple small telescopes rather than a single large telescope with a similar grasp or étendue. Among these key advancements are the availability of large-format back-side illuminated CMOS detectors with ≲4 μm pixels, well suited to sample standard seeing conditions given typical focal lengths of small fast telescopes. We also discuss the possible use of multiple small telescopes for spectroscopy and intensity interferometers. We argue that if all the obstacles to implementing cost-effective wide-field imaging and multi-object spectrographs using multiple small telescopes are removed, then the motivation to build new single large-aperture (≳1 m) visible-light telescopes which are seeing-dominated, will be weakened. These ideas have led to the concept of the, currently under construction, Large-Array Survey Telescope.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132l5004O,[]
The Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescopes for Survey: Overview and Performance of the System,"Over the past decade, time-domain astronomy in optical bands has developed rapidly with the operations of some wide-field survey facilities. However, most of these surveys are conducted with only a single band, and simultaneous color information is usually unavailable for the objects monitored during the survey. Here we present introductions to the system of Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescopes for Survey (TMTS), which consists of an array of four optical telescopes installed on a single equatorial mount. Such a system is designed to get multiband photometry simultaneously for stars and transients discovered during the survey. The optics of each telescope is a modified Hamilton-Newtonian system, covering the wavelengths from 400 to 900 nm, with a field of view (FoV) of about 4.5 deg<SUP>2</SUP> and a plate scale of 1""86 pixel<SUP>-1</SUP> when combining with a 4K × 4K QHY4040 CMOS detector. The TMTS system can have a FoV of about 9 deg<SUP>2</SUP> when monitoring the sky with two bands (i.e., SDSS g and r filters) at the same time, and a maximum FoV of ∼18 deg<SUP>2</SUP> when four telescopes monitor different sky areas in monochromatic filter mode. For an exposure time of 60 s, the average 3σ detection limit of the TMTS system can reach at ∼19.4 mag in Luminous filter and at ∼18.7 mag in SDSS r filter. The preliminary discovery obtained during the first few months&' survey is briefly discussed. As this telescope array is located at the Xinglong Observatory of NAOC, it can have an excellent synergy with the spectroscopic survey by the LAMOST (with a FoV of about 20 deg<SUP>2</SUP>) at the same site, which will benefit the studies of stellar and binary physics besides the transient sciences.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132l5001Z,[]
BC Cassiopeiae: First detection of IW Andromedae-type phenomenon among post-eruption novae,"IW And-type dwarf novae are a recently recognized group of cataclysmic variables which are characterized by a sequence of brightening from a standstill-like phase with damping oscillations often followed by a deep dip. We found that the supposed classical nova BC Cas which erupted in 1929 experienced a state of an IW And-type dwarf nova in 2018, 89 yr after the eruption. This finding suggests that a high mass-transfer rate following the nova eruption is associated with the IW And-type phenomenon. The mass of the white dwarf inferred from the decline rate of the nova is considerably higher than the average mass of the white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables, and these massive white dwarfs may be responsible for the manifestation of the IW And-type phenomenon.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASJ...72...98K,[]
A quasar microlensing event towards J1249+3449?,"We show that the optical flare event discovered by Graham et al. towards the active galactic nucleus J1249+3449 is fully consistent with being a quasar microlensing event due to a ≃0.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> star, although other explanations, such as that, mainly supported by Graham et al., of being the electromagnetic counterpart associated with a binary black hole merger, cannot be completely excluded at present.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499L..87D,[]
CO observations towards H-=I-rich Ultradiffuse Galaxies,"We present CO observations towards a sample of six H-=I-rich Ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs) as well as one UDG (VLSB-A) in the Virgo Cluster with the Institut de RadioAstronomie Millimétrique (IRAM) 30-m telescope. CO J = 1-0 is marginally detected at 4σ level in AGC 122966, as the first detection of CO emission in UDGs. We estimate upper limits of molecular mass in other galaxies from the non-detection of CO lines. These upper limits and the marginal CO detection in AGC 122966 indicate low mass ratios between molecular and atomic gas masses. With the star formation efficiency derived from the molecular gas, we suggest that the inefficiency of star formation in such H-=I-rich UDGs is likely caused by the low efficiency in converting molecules from atomic gas, instead of low efficiency in forming stars from molecular gas.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499L..26W,[]
Machine learning for transient recognition in difference imaging with minimum sampling effort,"The amount of observational data produced by time-domain astronomy is exponentially increasing. Human inspection alone is not an effective way to identify genuine transients from the data. An automatic real-bogus classifier is needed and machine learning techniques are commonly used to achieve this goal. Building a training set with a sufficiently large number of verified transients is challenging, due to the requirement of human verification. We present an approach for creating a training set by using all detections in the science images to be the sample of real detections and all detections in the difference images, which are generated by the process of difference imaging to detect transients, to be the samples of bogus detections. This strategy effectively minimizes the labour involved in the data labelling for supervised machine learning methods. We demonstrate the utility of the training set by using it to train several classifiers utilizing as the feature representation the normalized pixel values in 21 × 21 pixel stamps centred at the detection position, observed with the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) prototype. The real-bogus classifier trained with this strategy can provide up to $95{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ prediction accuracy on the real detections at a false alarm rate of $1{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ .",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.6009M,[]
Cosmic rates of black hole mergers and pair-instability supernovae from chemically homogeneous binary evolution,"During the first three observing runs of the Advanced gravitational-wave detector network, the LIGO/Virgo collaboration detected several black hole binary (BHBH) mergers. As the population of detected BHBH mergers grows, it will become possible to constrain different channels for their formation. Here we consider the chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) channel in close binaries, by performing population synthesis simulations that combine realistic binary models with detailed cosmological calculations of the chemical and star-formation history of the Universe. This allows us to constrain population properties, as well as cosmological and aLIGO/aVirgo detection rates of BHBH mergers formed through this pathway. We predict a BHBH merger rate at redshift zero of $5.8 \textrm {Gpc}^{-3} \textrm {yr}^{-1}$ through the CHE channel, to be compared with aLIGO/aVirgo's measured rate of ${53.2}_{-28.2}^{+55.8} \text{Gpc}^{-3}\text{yr}^{-1}$ , and find that eventual merger systems have BH masses in the range $17{-}43 \,\textrm {M}_{\odot }$ below the pair-instability supernova (PISN) gap, and ${}124 \textrm {M}_{\odot }$ above the PISN gap. We investigate effects of momentum kicks during black hole formation, and calculate cosmological and magnitude limited PISN rates. We also study the effects of high-redshift deviations in the star formation rate. We find that momentum kicks tend to increase delay times of BHBH systems, and our magnitude limited PISN rate estimates indicate that current deep surveys should be able to detect such events. Lastly, we find that our cosmological merger rate estimates change by at most ${\sim}8{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ for mild deviations of the star formation rate in the early Universe, and by up to ${\sim}40\,\text{per cent}$ for extreme deviations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.5941D,[]

Swift-XRT follow-up of gravitational wave triggers during the third aLIGO/Virgo observing run,"The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory followed up 18 gravitational wave (GW) triggers from the LIGO/Virgo collaboration during the O3 observing run in 2019/2020, performing approximately 6500 pointings in total. Of these events, four were finally classified (if real) as binary black hole (BH) triggers, six as binary neutron star (NS) events, two each of NSBH and Mass Gap triggers, one an unmodelled (Burst) trigger, and the remaining three were subsequently retracted. Thus far, four of these O3 triggers have been formally confirmed as real gravitational wave events. While no likely electromagnetic counterparts to any of these GW events have been identified in the X-ray data (to an average upper limit of 3.60 × 10<SUP>-12</SUP> erg cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> over 0.3-10 keV), or at other wavelengths, we present a summary of all the Swift-XRT observations performed during O3, together with typical upper limits for each trigger observed. The majority of X-ray sources detected during O3 were previously uncatalogued; while some of these will be new (transient) sources, others are simply too faint to have been detected by earlier survey missions such as ROSAT. The all-sky survey currently being performed by eROSITA will be a very useful comparison for future observing runs, reducing the number of apparent candidate X-ray counterparts by up to 95 per cent.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.3459P,[]
Classifying image sequences of astronomical transients with deep neural networks,"Supervised classification of temporal sequences of astronomical images into meaningful transient astrophysical phenomena has been considered a hard problem because it requires the intervention of human experts. The classifier uses the expert's knowledge to find heuristic features to process the images, for instance, by performing image subtraction or by extracting sparse information such as flux time-series, also known as light curves. We present a successful deep learning approach that learns directly from imaging data. Our method models explicitly the spatiotemporal patterns with deep convolutional neural networks and gated recurrent units. We train these deep neural networks using 1.3 million real astronomical images from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey to classify the sequences into five different types of astronomical transient classes. The TAO-Net (for Transient Astronomical Objects Network) architecture outperforms the results from random forest classification on light curves by 10 percentage points as measured by the F1 score for each class; the average F1 over classes goes from $45{{\ \rm percent}}$ with random forest classification to $55{{\ \rm percent}}$ with TAO-Net. This achievement with TAO-Net opens the possibility to develop new deep learning architectures for early transient detection. We make available the training data set and trained models of TAO-Net to allow for future extensions of this work.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.3130G,[]
Single magnetic white dwarfs with Balmer emission lines: a small class with consistent physical characteristics as possible signposts for close-in planetary companions,"We report the identification of SDSS J121929.45+471522.8 as the third apparently isolated magnetic (B ≃ 18.5 ± 1.0 MG) white dwarf exhibiting Zeeman-split Balmer emission lines. The star shows coherent variability at optical wavelengths with an amplitude of ≃0.03 mag and a period of 15.26 h, which we interpret as the spin period of the white dwarf. Modelling the spectral energy distribution and Gaia parallax, we derive a white dwarf temperature of 7500 ± 148 K, a mass of 0.649 ± 0.022 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and a cooling age of 1.5 ± 0.1 Gyr, as well as an upper limit on the temperature of a sub-stellar or giant planet companion of ≃250 K. The physical properties of this white dwarf match very closely those of the other two magnetic white dwarfs showing Balmer emission lines: GD356 and SDSS J125230.93-023417.7. We argue that, considering the growing evidence for planets and planetesimals on close orbits around white dwarfs, the unipolar inductor model provides a plausible scenario to explain the characteristics of this small class of stars. The tight clustering of the three stars in cooling age suggests a common mechanism switching the unipolar inductor on and off. Whereas Lorentz drift naturally limits the lifetime of the inductor phase, the relatively late onset of the line emission along the white dwarf cooling sequence remains unexplained.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.2564G,[]
Candidate periodically variable quasars from the Dark Energy Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,"Periodically variable quasars have been suggested as close binary supermassive black holes. We present a systematic search for periodic light curves in 625 spectroscopically confirmed quasars with a median redshift of 1.8 in a 4.6 deg<SUP>2</SUP> overlapping region of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova (DES-SN) fields and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 (SDSS-S82). Our sample has a unique 20-yr long multicolour (griz) light curve enabled by combining DES-SN Y6 observations with archival SDSS-S82 data. The deep imaging allows us to search for periodic light curves in less luminous quasars (down to r ~23.5 mag) powered by less massive black holes (with masses ≳ 10<SUP>8.5</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) at high redshift for the first time. We find five candidates with significant (at >99.74 per cent single-frequency significance in at least two bands with a global p-value of ~7 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP>-3 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> accounting for the look-elsewhere effect) periodicity with observed periods of ~3-5 yr (i.e. 1-2 yr in rest frame) having ~4-6 cycles spanned by the observations. If all five candidates are periodically variable quasars, this translates into a detection rate of ${\sim }0.8^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$ per cent or ${\sim }1.1^{+0.7}_{-0.5}$ quasar per deg<SUP>2</SUP>. Our detection rate is 4-80 times larger than those found by previous searches using shallower surveys over larger areas. This discrepancy is likely caused by differences in the quasar populations probed and the survey data qualities. We discuss implications on the future direct detection of low-frequency gravitational waves. Continued photometric monitoring will further assess the robustness and characteristics of these candidate periodic quasars to determine their physical origins.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.2245C,[]
The nature of the symbiotic candidate 2MASS J07363415+6538548 in the field of NGC 2403,"New Online Database of Symbiotic Variables includes several poorly characterized objects and candidate symbiotic stars, not only in the Milky Way but also in other galaxies. The goal of the research presented in this paper was to reveal the nature of 2MASS J07363415+6538548, the object discovered as an X-ray source in the field of NGC 2403, and tentatively classified as a symbiotic candidate or a cataclysmic variable. By analysis of available photometric data from ground-based surveys, together with a high-precision photometry from TESS, remarkable astrometric measurements of the Gaia satellite and observations of other surveys spanning from X-rays to infrared, we have found that the object neither not a symbiotic star nor a cataclysmic variable, but rather an active K-type dwarf. The star is located in the distance of 415 pc, has an effective temperature of 4275 K, luminosity of 0.14 L<SUB>⊙</SUB>, mass of 0.7 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and radius of 0.7 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>. It has a rotational period ~ 3 d and is a strong X-ray source with the X-ray luminosity of ~ $10^{30}\rm \, erg\, s^{-1}$.

Understanding the origin of white dwarf atmospheric pollution by dynamical simulations based on detected three-planet systems,"Between 25 and 50-= ${{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of white dwarfs (WD) present atmospheric pollution by metals, mainly by rocky material, which has been detected as gas/dust discs, or in the form of photometric transits in some WDs. Planets might be responsible for scattering minor bodies that can reach stargazing orbits, where the tidal forces of the WD can disrupt them and enhance the chances of debris to fall on to the WD surface. The planet-planet scattering process can be triggered by the stellar mass-loss during the post main-sequence (MS) evolution of planetary systems. In this work, we continue the exploration of the dynamical instabilities that can lead to WD pollution. In a previous work, we explored two-planet systems found around MS stars and here we extend the study to three-planet system architectures. We evolved 135 detected three-planet systems orbiting MS stars to the WD phase by scaling their orbital architectures in a way that their dynamical properties are preserved using the N-body integrator package MERCURY. We find that 100 simulations (8.6-= ${{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ ) are dynamically active (having planet losses, orbit crossing, and scattering) on the WD phase, where low-mass planets (1-100 M<SUB>⊕</SUB>) tend to have instabilities in Gyr time-scales, while high-mass planets (>100 M<SUB>⊕</SUB>) decrease the dynamical events more rapidly as the WD ages. Besides, 19 simulations (1.6-= ${{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ ) were found to have planets crossing the Roche radius of the WD, where 9 of them had planet-star collisions. Our three-planet simulations have a slight increase in percentage of simulations that may contribute to the WD pollution than the previous study involving two-planet systems and have shown that planet-planet scattering is responsible of sending planets close to the WD, where they may collide directly to the WD, become tidally disrupted or circularize their orbits, hence producing pollution on the WD atmosphere.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.1854M,[]
Neutron star mergers and how to study them,"Neutron star mergers are the canonical multimessenger events: they have been observed through photons for half a century, gravitational waves since 2017, and are likely to be sources of neutrinos and cosmic rays. Studies of these events enable unique insights into astrophysics, particles in the ultrarelativistic regime, the heavy element enrichment history through cosmic time, cosmology, dense matter, and fundamental physics. Uncovering this science requires vast observational resources, unparalleled coordination, and advancements in theory and simulation, which are constrained by our current understanding of nuclear, atomic, and astroparticle physics. This review begins with a summary of our current knowledge of these events, the expected observational signatures, and estimated detection rates for the next decade. I then present the key observations necessary to advance our understanding of these sources, followed by the broad science this enables. I close with a discussion on the necessary future capabilities to fully utilize these enigmatic sources to understand our universe.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020LRR....23....4B,[]
Preparation of egg white@zeolitic imidazolate framework-8@polyacrylic acid aerogel and its adsorption properties for organic dyes,"The egg white@zeolitic imidazolate framework-8@polyacrylic acid (EW@ZIF-8@PAA) aerogel was prepared by using in-situ polymerization of acrylic acid and freezing and freeze drying, with egg white and ZIF-8 as raw materials and 1, 4-butanediol as crosslinking agent. The aerogel possess irregular porous structure and exhibits good stability in water. The aerogel applied in the adsorption of organic dyes shows the adsorption for malachite green (MG), crystal violet (CV), methyl orange (MO) and rhodamine B (RB), which has excellent adsorption capacity for malachite green, and the maximum adsorption capacity is 2764.9 mg/g.

Merged white dwarfs and nucleosynthesis,"Orbital decay mechanisms argue that double white dwarf mergers are inevitable, but extremely rare. Whilst some mergers result in explosions, the survivors re-ignite helium and burn brightly for tens of thousands or millions of years. Candidate survivors include extreme helium stars, R CrB variables and various classes of helium-rich subluminous star. Nuclear waste on the survivors' surfaces provides evidence of the stars' nuclear history prior to and their nucleosynthesis during the merger. Extensive and deep spectroscopic surveys offer rich prospects for future discoveries.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020JApA...41...48J,[]
Generalized absurdly benign traversable wormholes powered by Casimir energy,"In this work, we explore the connection between Casimir energy and an Absurdly Benign Traversable Wormhole, which in the literature has been considered only in the pioneering paper of Morris and Thorne. To have consistency with the Casimir source, we need to generalize the idea of an Absurdly Benign Traversable Wormhole into a Generalized Absurdly Benign Traversable Wormhole. With this generalization, we have found that the wormhole throat is not more Planckian, but huge. Three profiles have been studied: one of them is directly connected with the Casimir source, while the other two have been obtained approximating the first one close to the throat. In all profiles the wormhole throat size is predicted to be of the order of 10<SUP>17</SUP>m . This huge size can be fine tuned by modulating the original Casimir energy source size. We have also found that the traceless and divergenceless property of the original Casimir stress energy tensor is here partially reproduced.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020EPJC...80.1172G,[]
Detecting shock waves in non-fundamental mode RR Lyrae using large sample of spectra in SDSS and LAMOST,"Steps toward the nature inside RR Lyrae variables can not only improve our understanding of variable stars but also innovate the precision when we use them as tracers to map the structure of the universe. In this work, we develop a hand-crafted one-dimensional pattern recognition pipeline to fetch out the ""first apparitions"", the most prominent observational characteristic of shock. We report the first detection of hydrogen emission lines in the first-overtone and multi-mode RR Lyrae variables. We find that there is an anti-correlation between the intensity and the radial velocity of the emission signal, which is possibly caused by opacity changing in the helium ionization zone. Moreover, we find one RRd star with hydrogen emission that possibly shows Blazhko-type modulations. According to our discoveries, with an enormous volume of upcoming data releases of variable stars and spectra, it may become possible to build up the bridge between shock waves and big problems like the Blazhko effect in non-fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020CoBAO..67..181D,[]
An Early-warning System for Electromagnetic Follow-up of Gravitational-wave Events,Binary neutron stars (BNSs) will spend ≃10-15 minutes in the band of Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo detectors at design sensitivity. Matched-filtering of gravitational-wave (GW) data could in principle accumulate enough signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) to identify a forthcoming event tens of seconds before the companions collide and merge. Here we report on the design and testing of an early-warning GW detection pipeline. Early-warning alerts can be produced for sources that are at low enough redshift so that a large enough S/N accumulates ∼10-60 s before merger. We find that about 7% (49%) of the total detectable BNS mergers will be detected 60 s (10 s) before the merger. About 2% of the total detectable BNS mergers will be detected before merger and localized to within 100 deg<SUP>2</SUP> (90% credible interval). Coordinated observing by several wide-field telescopes could capture the event seconds before or after the merger. LIGO-Virgo detectors at design sensitivity could facilitate observing at least one event at the onset of merger.,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905L..25S,[]
An 8.8 Minute Orbital Period Eclipsing Detached Double White Dwarf Binary,"We report the discovery of ZTF J2243+5242, an eclipsing double white dwarf binary with an orbital period of just 8.8 minutes, the second known eclipsing binary with an orbital period of less than 10 minutes. The system likely consists of two low-mass white dwarfs and will merge in approximately 400,000 yr to form either an isolated hot subdwarf or an R Coronae Borealis star. Like its 6.91 minute counterpart, ZTF J1539+5027, ZTF J2243+5242 will be among the strongest gravitational-wave sources detectable by the space-based gravitational-wave detector the Laser Space Interferometer Antenna (LISA) because its gravitational-wave frequency falls near the peak of LISA's sensitivity. Based on its estimated distance of $d={2425}_{-114}^{+108}\,\mathrm{pc}$ , LISA should detect the source within its first few months of operation and achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 63 ± 7 after 4 yr. We find component masses of ${M}_{A}={0.323}_{-0.047}^{+0.065}$ and ${M}_{B}={0.335}_{-0.054}^{+0.052}\,{M}_{\odot }$ , radii of ${R}_{A}={0.0298}_{-0.0012}^{+0.0013}$ and ${R}_{B}={0.0275}_{-0.0013}^{+0.0012}\,{R}_{\odot }$ , and effective temperatures of ${T}_{A}={26,300}_{-900}^{+1700}$ and ${T}_{B}={19,200}_{-900}^{+1500}\,{\rm{K}}$ .

Application of The Wind-driven Model to a Sample of Tidal Disruption Events,"An origin of the optical/ultraviolet (UV) radiation from tidal disruption events (TDEs) has recently been discussed for different scenarios, but observational support is generally lacking. In this Letter, we test the applicability of the ""wind-driven model"" for a sample of UV/optical TDEs. With the model, we aim to derive the physical properties of the optical/UV TDEs, such as mass-loss rates and characteristic radii. The model assumes optically thick continuous outflows like stellar winds, and one key question arises: how is the wind-launched radius connected to physical processes in TDEs? Here we propose one possibility: through a comparison between the escape velocities estimated from their black hole masses and the wind velocities estimated from observed line widths, the outflow is launched from the self-interaction radius (R<SUB>SI</SUB>) where the stellar debris stretched by the tidal force intersects. We show that the escape velocities at R<SUB>SI</SUB> are roughly consistent with the wind velocities. By applying the model to a sample of optical/UV TDE candidates, we find that explosive mass ejections (≳10 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) from R<SUB>SI</SUB> (∼10<SUP>14</SUP> cm) can explain the observed properties of TDEs around peak luminosity. We also apply the same framework to a peculiar transient, AT2018cow. This model suggests that AT2018cow is likely a TDE induced by an intermediate-mass black hole (M<SUB>BH</SUB> ∼ 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905L...5U,[]
Kilonova Luminosity Function Constraints Based on Zwicky Transient Facility Searches for 13 Neutron Star Merger Triggers during O3,"We present a systematic search for optical counterparts to 13 gravitational wave (GW) triggers involving at least one neutron star during LIGO/Virgo's third observing run (O3). We searched binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star black hole (NSBH) merger localizations with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and undertook follow-up with the Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) collaboration. The GW triggers had a median localization area of 4480 deg<SUP>2</SUP>, a median distance of 267 Mpc, and false-alarm rates ranging from 1.5 to 10<SUP>-25</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The ZTF coverage in the g and r bands had a median enclosed probability of 39%, median depth of 20.8 mag, and median time lag between merger and the start of observations of 1.5 hr. The O3 follow-up by the GROWTH team comprised 340 UltraViolet/Optical/InfraRed (UVOIR) photometric points, 64 OIR spectra, and three radio images using 17 different telescopes. We find no promising kilonovae (radioactivity-powered counterparts), and we show how to convert the upper limits to constrain the underlying kilonova luminosity function. Initially, we assume that all GW triggers are bona fide astrophysical events regardless of false-alarm rate and that kilonovae accompanying BNS and NSBH mergers are drawn from a common population; later, we relax these assumptions. Assuming that all kilonovae are at least as luminous as the discovery magnitude of GW170817 (-16.1 mag), we calculate that our joint probability of detecting zero kilonovae is only 4.2%. If we assume that all kilonovae are brighter than -16.6 mag (the extrapolated peak magnitude of GW170817) and fade at a rate of 1 mag day<SUP>-1</SUP> (similar to GW170817), the joint probability of zero detections is 7%. If we separate the NSBH and BNS populations based on the online classifications, the joint probability of zero detections, assuming all kilonovae are brighter than -16.6 mag, is 9.7% for NSBH and 7.9% for BNS mergers. Moreover, no more than <57% (<89%) of putative kilonovae could be brighter than -16.6 mag assuming flat evolution (fading by 1 mag day<SUP>-1</SUP>) at the 90% confidence level. If we further take into account the online terrestrial probability for each GW trigger, we find that no more than <68% of putative kilonovae could be brighter than -16.6 mag. Comparing to model grids, we find that some kilonovae must have M<SUB>ej</SUB> < 0.03 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, X<SUB>lan</SUB> > 10<SUP>-4</SUP>, or φ > 30° to be consistent with our limits. We look forward to searches in the fourth GW observing run; even 17 neutron star mergers with only 50% coverage to a depth of -16 mag would constrain the maximum fraction of bright kilonovae to <25%.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905..145K,[]
ZTF20aajnksq (AT 2020blt): A Fast Optical Transient at z ≈ 2.9 with No Detected Gamma-Ray Burst Counterpart,"We present ZTF20aajnksq (AT 2020blt), a fast-fading (Δr = 2.3 mag in Δt = 1.3 days) red (g - r ≈ 0.6 mag) and luminous (M<SUB>1626 Å</SUB> = -25.9 mag) optical transient at z = 2.9 discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). AT 2020blt shares several features in common with afterglows to long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs): (1) an optical light curve well-described by a broken power law with a break at t<SUB>j</SUB> = 1 d (observer frame); (2) a luminous (L<SUB>0.3-10 KeV</SUB> = 10<SUP>46</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) X-ray counterpart; and (3) luminous (L<SUB>10 GHz</SUB> = 4 × 10<SUP>31</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> Hz<SUP>-1</SUP>) radio emission. However, no GRB was detected in the 0.74 days between the last ZTF nondetection (r > 21.36 mag) and the first ZTF detection (r = 19.60 mag), with an upper limit on the isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray energy release of E<SUB>γ,iso</SUB> < 7 × 10<SUP>52</SUP> erg. AT 2020blt is thus the third afterglow-like transient discovered without a detected GRB counterpart (after PTF11agg and ZTF19abvizsw) and the second (after ZTF19abvizsw) with a redshift measurement. We conclude that the properties of AT 2020blt are consistent with a classical (initial Lorentz factor Γ<SUB>0</SUB> ≳ 100) on-axis GRB that was missed by high-energy satellites. Furthermore, by estimating the rate of transients with light curves similar to that of AT 2020blt in ZTF high-cadence data, we agree with previous results that there is no evidence for an afterglow-like phenomenon that is significantly more common than classical GRBs, such as dirty fireballs. We conclude by discussing the status and future of fast-transient searches in wide-field high-cadence optical surveys.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905...98H,[]
SuperRAENN: A Semisupervised Supernova Photometric Classification Pipeline Trained on Pan-STARRS1 Medium-Deep Survey Supernovae,"Automated classification of supernovae (SNe) based on optical photometric light-curve information is essential in the upcoming era of wide-field time domain surveys, such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) conducted by the Rubin Observatory. Photometric classification can enable real-time identification of interesting events for extended multiwavelength follow-up, as well as archival population studies. Here we present the complete sample of 5243 ""SN-like"" light curves (in g<SUB>P1</SUB>r<SUB>P1</SUB>i<SUB>P1</SUB>z<SUB>P1</SUB>) from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium-Deep Survey (PS1-MDS). The PS1-MDS is similar to the planned LSST Wide-Fast-Deep survey in terms of cadence, filters, and depth, making this a useful training set for the community. Using this data set, we train a novel semisupervised machine learning algorithm to photometrically classify 2315 new SN-like light curves with host galaxy spectroscopic redshifts. Our algorithm consists of an RF supervised classification step and a novel unsupervised step in which we introduce a recurrent autoencoder neural network (RAENN). Our final pipeline, dubbed SuperRAENN, has an accuracy of 87% across five SN classes (Type Ia, Ibc, II, IIn, SLSN-I) and macro-averaged purity and completeness of 66% and 69%, respectively. We find the highest accuracy rates for SNe Ia and SLSNe and the lowest for SNe Ibc. Our complete spectroscopically and photometrically classified samples break down into 62.0% Type Ia (1839 objects), 19.8% Type II (553 objects), 4.8% Type IIn (136 objects), 11.7% Type Ibc (291 objects), and 1.6% Type I SLSNe (54 objects).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905...94V,[]
Photometric Classification of 2315 Pan-STARRS1 Supernovae with Superphot,"The classification of supernovae (SNe) and its impact on our understanding of explosion physics and progenitors have traditionally been based on the presence or absence of certain spectral features. However, current and upcoming wide-field time-domain surveys have increased the transient discovery rate far beyond our capacity to obtain even a single spectrum of each new event. We must therefore rely heavily on photometric classification—connecting SN light curves back to their spectroscopically defined classes. Here, we present Superphot, an open-source Python implementation of the machine-learning classification algorithm of Villar et al., and apply it to 2315 previously unclassified transients from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey for which we obtained spectroscopic host-galaxy redshifts. Our classifier achieves an overall accuracy of 82%, with completenesses and purities of >80% for the best classes (SNe Ia and superluminous SNe). For the worst performing SN class (SNe Ibc), the completeness and purity fall to 37% and 21%, respectively. Our classifier provides 1257 newly classified SNe Ia, 521 SNe II, 298 SNe Ibc, 181 SNe IIn, and 58 SLSNe. These are among the largest uniformly observed samples of SNe available in the literature and will enable a wide range of statistical studies of each class.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905...93H,[]
Quasars That Have Transitioned from Radio-quiet to Radio-loud on Decadal Timescales Revealed by VLASS and FIRST,"We have performed a search over 3440 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of Epoch 1 (2017-2019) of the Very Large Array Sky Survey to identify unobscured quasars in the optical (0.2 < z < 3.2) and obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the infrared that have brightened dramatically in the radio over the past one to two decades. These sources would have been previously classified as ""radio-quiet"" quasars based on upper limits from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey (1993-2011), but they are now consistent with ""radio-loud"" quasars ( ${L}_{3\mathrm{GHz}}={10}^{40\mbox{--}42}\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ ). A quasi-simultaneous, multiband (∼1-18 GHz) follow-up study of 14 sources with the VLA has revealed compact sources (<0""1 or <1 kpc) with peaked radio spectral shapes. The high-amplitude variability over decadal timescales at 1.5 GHz (100% to >2500%) but roughly steady fluxes over a few months at 3 GHz are inconsistent with extrinsic variability due to propagation effects, thus favoring an intrinsic origin. We conclude that our sources are powerful quasars hosting compact/young jets. This challenges the generally accepted idea that ""radio-loudness"" is a property of the quasar/AGN population that remains fixed on human timescales. Our study suggests that frequent episodes of short-lived AGN jets that do not necessarily grow to large scales may be common at high redshift. We speculate that intermittent but powerful jets on subgalactic scales could interact with the interstellar medium, possibly driving feedback capable of influencing galaxy evolution.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905...74N,[]
The Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe. I. Systematic Search for Calcium-rich Gap Transients Reveals Three Related Spectroscopic Subclasses,"Using the Zwicky Transient Facility alert stream, we are conducting a large spectroscopic campaign to construct a complete, volume-limited sample of transients brighter than 20 mag, and coincident within 100″ of galaxies in the Census of the Local Universe catalog. We describe the experiment design and spectroscopic completeness from the first 16 months of operations, which have classified 754 supernovae. We present results from a systematic search for calcium-rich gap transients in the sample of 22 low-luminosity (peak absolute magnitude M > -17), hydrogen-poor events found in the experiment. We report the detection of eight new events, and constrain their volumetric rate to ≳15% ± 5% of the SN Ia rate. Combining this sample with 10 previously known events, we find a likely continuum of spectroscopic properties ranging from events with SN Ia-like features (Ca-Ia objects) to those with SN Ib/c-like features (Ca-Ib/c objects) at peak light. Within the Ca-Ib/c events, we find two populations distinguished by their red (g - r ≈ 1.5 mag) or green ( $g-r\approx 0.5$ mag) colors at the r-band peak, wherein redder events show strong line blanketing features and slower light curves (similar to Ca-Ia objects), weaker He lines, and lower [Ca II]/[O I] in the nebular phase. We find that all together the spectroscopic continuum, volumetric rates, and striking old environments are consistent with the explosive burning of He shells on low-mass white dwarfs. We suggest that Ca-Ia and red Ca-Ib/c objects arise from the double detonation of He shells, while green Ca-Ib/c objects are consistent with low-efficiency burning scenarios like detonations in low-density shells or deflagrations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905...58D,[]
High-redshift Extreme Variability Quasars from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Multiepoch Spectroscopy,"We perform a systematic search for high-redshift ( $z\, $ 1.5) extreme variability quasars (EVQs) using repeat spectra from the Sixteenth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which provides a baseline spanning up to ∼18 yr in the observed frame. We compile a sample of 348 EVQs with a maximum continuum variability at rest frame 1450 Å of more than 100% (i.e., δV ≡ (Max - Min)/Mean > 1). The EVQs show a range of emission-line variability, including 23 where at least one line in our redshift range disappears below detectability, which can then be seen as analogous to low-redshift changing-look quasars (CLQs). Importantly, spurious CLQs caused by problematic SDSS spectral flux calibration, e.g., fiber-drop issue, have been rejected. The similar properties (e.g., continuum/line, difference-composite spectra and Eddington ratio) of normal EVQs and CLQs imply that they are basically the same physical population with analogous intrinsic variability mechanisms, as a tail of a continuous distribution of normal quasar properties. In addition, we find no reliable evidence (≲1σ) to support that CLQs are a subset of EVQs with less efficient accretion. Finally, we also confirm the antibreathing of C IV (i.e., the line width increases as luminosity increases) in EVQs and find that in addition to the ∼0.4 dex systematic uncertainty in single-epoch C IV virial black hole mass estimates, an extra scatter of ∼0.3 dex will be introduced by extreme variability.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905...52G,[]
A Systematic Search of Zwicky Transient Facility Data for Ultracompact Binary LISA-detectable Gravitational-wave Sources,"Using photometry collected with the Zwicky Transient Facility, we are conducting an ongoing survey for binary systems with short orbital periods ( ${P}_{{\rm{b}}} 1\,\mathrm{hr})$ with the goal of identifying new gravitational-wave sources detectable by the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We present a sample of 15 binary systems discovered thus far, with orbital periods ranging from 6.91 to 56.35 minutes. Of the 15 systems, seven are eclipsing systems that do not show signs of significant mass transfer. Additionally, we have discovered two AM Canum Venaticorum systems and six systems exhibiting primarily ellipsoidal variations in their lightcurves. We present follow-up spectroscopy and high-speed photometry confirming the nature of these systems, estimates of their LISA signal-to-noise ratios, and a discussion of their physical characteristics.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...905...32B,[]
Standard Candles and Sirens Rescue H<SUB>0</SUB>,"We show that future observations of binary neutron star systems with electromagnetic counterparts together with the traditional probes of low- and high-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) can help resolve the Hubble tension. The luminosity distance inferred from these probes and its scatter depend on the underlying cosmology. By using the gravitational lensing of light or gravitational waves emitted by, and peculiar motion of, these systems we derive constraints on the sum of neutrino masses, the equation of state of dark energy parameterized in the form ${w}_{0}+{w}_{a}(1-a)$ , along with the Hubble constant and cold dark matter density in the universe. We show that even after marginalizing over poorly constrained physical quantities, such as the sum of neutrino masses and the nature of dark energy, low-redshift gravitational-wave observations, in combination with SNe Ia, have the potential to rule out new physics as the underlying cause of the Hubble tension at ≳5.5σ.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...904..169A,[]
Constraining the Kilonova Rate with Zwicky Transient Facility Searches Independent of Gravitational Wave and Short Gamma-Ray Burst Triggers,"The first binary neutron star merger, GW170817, was accompanied by a radioactivity-powered optical/infrared transient called a kilonova. To date, no compelling kilonova has been found in all-sky optical surveys, independently of short gamma-ray burst and gravitational-wave triggers. In this work, we searched the first 23 months of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data stream for candidate kilonovae in the form of rapidly evolving transients. We combined ZTF alert queries with forced point-spread-function photometry and nightly flux stacking to increase our sensitivity to faint and fast transients. Automatic queries yielded >11,200 candidates, 24 of which passed quality checks and selection criteria based on a grid of kilonova models tailored for both binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole mergers. None of the candidates in our sample was deemed a possible kilonova after thorough vetting. The sources that passed our selection criteria are dominated by Galactic cataclysmic variables. We identified two fast transients at high Galactic latitude, one of which is the confirmed afterglow of long-duration GRB 190106A, the other is a possible cosmological afterglow. Using a survey simulation code, we constrained the kilonova rate for a range of models including top-hat, linearly decaying light curves, and synthetic light curves obtained with radiative transfer simulations. For prototypical GW170817-like kilonovae, we constrain the rate to be $R 1775$ Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> (95% confidence). By assuming a population of kilonovae with the same geometry and composition of GW170817 observed under a uniform viewing angle distribution, we obtained a constraint on the rate of R < 4029 Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...904..155A,[]
The First Extensive Spectroscopic Study of Young Stars in the North America and Pelican Nebulae,"We present a spectroscopic survey of over 3400 potential members in the North America and Pelican Nebulae (NAP) using several low-resolution (R ≈ 1300-2000) spectrographs: Palomar/Norris, WIYN/Hydra, Keck/DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS), and the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT)/Hectospec. We identify 580 young stars as likely members of the NAP region based on criteria involving infrared excess, Li I 6708 Å absorption, X-ray emission, parallax, and proper motions. The spectral types of individual spectra are derived by fitting them with templates that are either empirical spectra of pre-main-sequence stars or model atmospheres. The templates are artificially veiled, and a best-fit combination of spectral type and veiling parameter is derived for each star. We use the spectral types with archival photometry to derive V-band extinction and stellar luminosity. From the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, the median age of the young stars is about 1 Myr, with a luminosity dispersion of ∼0.3-0.4 dex. We investigate the photometric variability of the spectroscopic member sample using Zwicky Transient Facility data and conclude that photometric variability, while present, does not significantly contribute to the luminosity dispersion. While larger than the formal errors, the luminosity dispersion is smaller than if veiling were not taken into account in our spectral typing process. The measured ages of the stellar kinematic groups, combined with the inferred ages for embedded stellar populations revealed by Spitzer, suggest a sequential history of star formation in the NAP region.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...904..146F,[]
Tidal Disruptions of Main-sequence Stars. II. Simulation Methodology and Stellar Mass Dependence of the Character of Full Tidal Disruptions,"This is the second in a series of papers presenting the results of fully general relativistic simulations of stellar tidal disruptions in which the stars' initial states are realistic main-sequence models. In the first paper, we gave an overview of this program and discussed the principal observational implications of our work. Here we describe our calculational method, which includes a new method for calculating fully relativistic stellar self-gravity, and provide details about the outcomes of full disruptions, focusing on the stellar mass dependence of the outcomes for a black hole of mass 10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We consider eight different stellar masses, from 0.15 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> to 10 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We find that, relative to the traditional order-of-magnitude estimate r<SUB>t</SUB>, the physical tidal radius of low-mass stars (M<SUB>⋆</SUB> ≲ 0.7 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) is larger by tens of percent, while for high-mass stars (M<SUB>⋆</SUB> ≳ 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) it is smaller by a factor of 2-2.5. The traditional estimate of the range of energies found in the debris is ≈1.4× too large for low-mass stars, but is a factor of ∼2 too small for high-mass stars; in addition, the energy distribution for high-mass stars has significant wings. For all stars undergoing tidal encounters, we find that mass loss continues for many stellar vibration times because the black hole's tidal gravity competes with the instantaneous stellar gravity at the star's surface until the star has reached a distance from the black hole ∼O(10)r<SUB>t</SUB>.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...904...99R,[]
Tidal Disruptions of Main-sequence Stars. I. Observable Quantities and Their Dependence on Stellar and Black Hole Mass,"This paper introduces a series of papers presenting a quantitative theory for the tidal disruption of main-sequence stars by supermassive black holes. Using fully general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations and MESA-model initial conditions, we explore the pericenter-dependence of tidal disruption properties for eight stellar masses ( $0.15\leqslant {M}_{\star }/{M}_{\odot }\leqslant 10$ ) and six black hole masses ( ${10}^{5}\leqslant {M}_{\mathrm{BH}}/{M}_{\odot }\leqslant 5\times {10}^{7}$ ). We present here the results most relevant to observations. The effects of internal stellar structure and relativity decouple for both the disruption cross section and the characteristic energy width of the debris. Moreover, the full disruption cross section is almost independent of M<SUB>⋆</SUB> for M<SUB>⋆</SUB>/M<SUB>⊙</SUB> ≲ 3. Independent of M<SUB>⋆</SUB>, relativistic effects increase the critical pericenter distance for full disruption events by up to a factor of ∼3 relative to the Newtonian prediction. The probability of a direct capture is also independent of M<SUB>⋆</SUB>; at M<SUB>BH</SUB>/M<SUB>⊙</SUB> ≃ 5 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> this probability is equal to the probability of a complete disruption. The breadth of the debris energy distribution ΔE can differ from the standard estimate by factors of 0.35 - 2, depending on M<SUB>⋆</SUB> and M<SUB>BH</SUB>, implying a corresponding change (∝(ΔE)<SUP>-3/2</SUP>) in the characteristic mass-return timescale. We provide analytic forms, suitable for use in both event rate estimates and parameter inference, to describe all these trends. For partial disruptions, we find a nearly universal relation between the star's angular momentum and the fraction of M<SUB>⋆</SUB> remaining. Within the ""empty loss-cone"" regime, partial disruptions must precede full disruptions. These partial disruptions can drastically affect the rate and appearance of subsequent total disruptions.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...904...98R,[]
Over 10000 δ Scuti Stars toward the Galactic Bulge from OGLE-IV,"We present a collection of 10 111 genuine δ Sct-type pulsating variable stars detected in the OGLE-IV Galactic bulge fields. In this sample, 9835 variables are new discoveries. For most of the stars photometric data cover the whole decade 2010-2019. We illustrate a huge variety of light curve shapes of δ Sct variables. Long-term observations have allowed us to spot objects with evident period, amplitude, and mean brightness variations. Our analysis indicates that about 28% of the stars are single-mode pulsators. Fourteen δ Sct stars show additional eclipsing or ellipsoidal binary modulation. We report significant attenuation or even disappearance of the pulsation signal in six sources. The whole set of variables is a mix of objects representing various Milky Way's populations, with the majority of stars from the Galactic bulge. There are also representatives of the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy. Some of the newly detected variables could be SX Phe-type stars residing in globular clusters. The collection, including full V- and I-band time-series data, is available to the astronomical community from the OGLE On-line Data Archive.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AcA....70..241P,[]
An Asymmetric Eclipse Seen toward the Pre-main-sequence Binary System V928 Tau,"K2 observations of the weak-lined T Tauri binary V928 Tau A and B show the detection of a single, asymmetric eclipse, which may be due to a previously unknown substellar companion eclipsing one component of the binary with an orbital period >66 days. Over an interval of about 9 hr, one component of the binary dims by around 60%, returning to its normal brightness about 5 hr later. From modeling of the eclipse shape, we find evidence that the eclipsing companion may be surrounded by a disk or a vast ring system. The modeled disk has a radius of 0.9923 ± 0.0005 R<SUB>*</SUB>, with an inclination of 56°78 ± 0°03, a tilt of 41°22 ± 0°05, an impact parameter of -0.2506 ± 0.0002 R<SUB>*</SUB>, and an opacity of 1.00. The occulting disk must also move at a transverse velocity of 6.637 ± 0.002 R<SUB>*</SUB> day<SUP>-1</SUP>, which, depending on whether it orbits V928 Tau A or B, corresponds to approximately 73.53 or 69.26 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. A search in ground-based archival data reveals additional dimming events, some of which suggest periodicity, but no unambiguous period associated with the eclipse observed by K2. We present a new epoch of astrometry that is used to further refine the orbit of the binary, presenting a new lower bound of 67 yr, and constraints on the possible orbital periods of the eclipsing companion. The binary is also separated by 18″ (∼2250 au) from the lower-mass CFHT-BD-Tau 7, which is likely associated with V928 Tau A and B. We also present new high-dispersion optical spectroscopy that we use to characterize the unresolved stellar binary.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160..285V,[]
Periodic Eruptive Variability of the Isolated Pre-main-sequence Star V347 Aurigae,"V347 Aurigae is associated with the small dark cloud L1438 and appears to be an isolated pre-main-sequence star located at distance d ≈ 200 pc. Multi-epoch, archival photometry reveals periodic brightness variations with amplitude V ≈ 2.0 mag occurring on timescales of ∼160 days that have persisted for decades. Regular-cadence, optical imaging of the source with the Zwicky Transient Facility shows that a small reflection nebula illuminated by V347 Aur also fluctuates in brightness, at times fading completely. Multi-epoch, Keck/HIRES data suggests the presence of two distinct spectral components: a prominent emission-line-dominated spectrum with a heavily veiled continuum correlated with the bright photometric state, and an M-type absorption line spectrum associated with quiescence. All spectra exhibit strong Balmer and He I line emission, consistent with accretion, as well as high velocity emission arising from the forbidden transitions of [O I], [N II], and [S II] that are generally associated with collimated jets and disk winds. There is no evidence in existing high-dispersion spectroscopy or high-resolution imaging for binarity of V347 Aur. The repeating outburst events are possibly linked to accretion instabilities induced by an undetected companion or a structure within the circumstellar disk that periodically increases the mass accretion rate. V347 Aur is perhaps analogous to an EXor-type variable, though more regularly recurring.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160..278D,[]
Establishing Earth's Minimoon Population through Characterization of Asteroid 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB>,"We report on our detailed characterization of Earth's second known temporary natural satellite, or minimoon, asteroid 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB>. An artificial origin can be ruled out based on its area-to-mass ratio and broadband photometry, which suggest that it is a silicate asteroid belonging to the S or V complex in asteroid taxonomy. The discovery of 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB> allows for the first time a comparison between known minimoons and theoretical models of their expected physical and dynamical properties. The estimated diameter of ${1.2}_{-0.2}^{+0.4}$ m and geocentric capture approximately a decade after the first known minimoon, 2006 RH<SUB>120</SUB>, are in agreement with theoretical predictions. The capture duration of 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB> of at least 2.7 yr is unexpectedly long compared to the simulation average, but it is in agreement with simulated minimoons that have close lunar encounters, providing additional support for the orbital models. 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB>'s atypical rotation period, significantly longer than theoretical predictions, suggests that our understanding of meter-scale asteroids needs revision.

A Mini-Neptune and a Radius Valley Planet Orbiting the Nearby M2 Dwarf TOI-1266 in Its Venus Zone: Validation with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder,"We report on the validation of two planets orbiting the nearby (36 pc) M2 dwarf TOI-1266 observed by the TESS mission. This system is one of a few M dwarf multiplanet systems with close-in planets where the inner planet is substantially larger than the outer planet. The inner planet is sub-Neptune-sized (R = 2.46 ± 0.08 R<SUB>⊕</SUB>) with an orbital period of 10.9 days, while the outer planet has a radius of ${1.67}_{-0.11}^{+0.09}$ R<SUB>⊕</SUB> and resides in the exoplanet radius valley—the transition region between rocky and gaseous planets. With an orbital period of 18.8 days, the outer planet receives an insolation flux of 2.4 times that of Earth, similar to the insolation of Venus. Using precision near-infrared radial velocities with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder Spectrograph, we place upper mass limits of 15.9 and 6.4 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> at 95% confidence for the inner and outer planet, respectively. A more precise mass constraint of both planets, achievable with current radial velocity instruments given the host star brightness (V = 12.9, J = 9.7), will yield further insights into the dominant processes sculpting the exoplanet radius valley.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160..259S,[]
Recoverability of Known Near-Earth Asteroids,"This paper analyzes the current population of known near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and presents statistics on the recoverability of NEAs with both targeted observation campaigns and all-sky surveys. For an asteroid to be observable at a future apparition, given the right geometry, the plane-of-sky uncertainty must be small enough to be covered by a telescope's field of view and the asteroid must be brighter than the detector's limiting magnitude. Since recoverability is a telescope-dependent property, we select two representative instruments that span a wide range of capability and availability: the 1.0 m I52 telescope of the Catalina Sky Survey and the Hyper Suprime-Cam of the 8.2 m Subaru telescope. Based on this choice, we classify asteroids as recoverable, potentially recoverable, and not recoverable depending on whether they could be detected with an I52-class telescope, only with a Subaru-class telescope, or with neither, respectively. Using these definitions, we find that the majority (90%) of NEAs with H < 22 and most (93%) potentially hazardous asteroids are recoverable or potentially recoverable in the next 50 yr. When considering fainter asteroids down to H ≤ 28, about two-thirds of the NEA population and half of the low minimum-orbit intersection distance (MOID) asteroids (MOID ≤ 0.05 au) are either recoverable or potentially recoverable. As of 2019 October 13, the Sentry risk list includes 193 objects with an impact probability greater than 10<SUP>-6</SUP> that are not recoverable. The fraction of NEAs and low-MOID NEAs that are not recoverable can be reduced by up to 47% and 43%, respectively, when incorporating statistical estimates of serendipitous recoveries by all-sky surveys.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160..250R,[]
Strong dependence of Type Ia supernova standardization on the local specific star formation rate,"As part of an on-going effort to identify, understand and correct for astrophysics biases in the standardization of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) for cosmology, we have statistically classified a large sample of nearby SNe Ia into those that are located in predominantly younger or older environments. This classification is based on the specific star formation rate measured within a projected distance of 1 kpc from each SN location (LsSFR). This is an important refinement compared to using the local star formation rate directly, as it provides a normalization for relative numbers of available SN progenitors and is more robust against extinction by dust. We find that the SNe Ia in predominantly younger environments are Δ<SUB>Y</SUB> = 0.163 ± 0.029 mag (5.7σ) fainter than those in predominantly older environments after conventional light-curve standardization. This is the strongest standardized SN Ia brightness systematic connected to the host-galaxy environment measured to date. The well-established step in standardized brightnesses between SNe Ia in hosts with lower or higher total stellar masses is smaller, at Δ<SUB>M</SUB> = 0.119 ± 0.032 mag (4.5σ), for the same set of SNe Ia. When fit simultaneously, the environment-age offset remains very significant, with Δ<SUB>Y</SUB> = 0.129 ± 0.032 mag (4.0σ), while the global stellar mass step is reduced to Δ<SUB>M</SUB> = 0.064 ± 0.029 mag (2.2σ). Thus, approximately 70% of the variance from the stellar mass step is due to an underlying dependence on environment-based progenitor age. Also, we verify that using the local star formation rate alone is not as powerful as LsSFR at sorting SNe Ia into brighter and fainter subsets. Standardization that only uses the SNe Ia in younger environments reduces the total dispersion from 0.142 ± 0.008 mag to 0.120 ± 0.010 mag. We show that as environment-ages evolve with redshift, a strong bias, especially on the measurement of the derivative of the dark energy equation of state, can develop. Fortunately, data that measure and correct for this effect using our local specific star formation rate indicator, are likely to be available for many next-generation SN Ia cosmology experiments.",,[]

HOLISMOKES. II. Identifying galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses in Pan-STARRS using convolutional neural networks,"We present a systematic search for wide-separation (with Einstein radius θ<SUB>E</SUB> ≳ 1.5″), galaxy-scale strong lenses in the 30 000 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of the Pan-STARRS 3π survey on the Northern sky. With long time delays of a few days to weeks, these types of systems are particularly well-suited for catching strongly lensed supernovae with spatially-resolved multiple images and offer new insights on early-phase supernova spectroscopy and cosmography. We produced a set of realistic simulations by painting lensed COSMOS sources on Pan-STARRS image cutouts of lens luminous red galaxies (LRGs) with redshift and velocity dispersion known from the sloan digital sky survey (SDSS). First, we computed the photometry of mock lenses in gri bands and applied a simple catalog-level neural network to identify a sample of 1 050 207 galaxies with similar colors and magnitudes as the mocks. Second, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on Pan-STARRS gri image cutouts to classify this sample and obtain sets of 105 760 and 12 382 lens candidates with scores of p<SUB>CNN</SUB> > 0.5 and > 0.9, respectively. Extensive tests showed that CNN performances rely heavily on the design of lens simulations and the choice of negative examples for training, but little on the network architecture. The CNN correctly classified 14 out of 16 test lenses, which are previously confirmed lens systems above the detection limit of Pan-STARRS. Finally, we visually inspected all galaxies with p<SUB>CNN</SUB> > 0.9 to assemble a final set of 330 high-quality newly-discovered lens candidates while recovering 23 published systems. For a subset, SDSS spectroscopy on the lens central regions proves that our method correctly identifies lens LRGs at z ∼ 0.1-0.7. Five spectra also show robust signatures of high-redshift background sources, and Pan-STARRS imaging confirms one of them as a quadruply-imaged red source at z<SUB>s</SUB> = 1.185, which is likely a recently quenched galaxy strongly lensed by a foreground LRG at z<SUB>d</SUB> = 0.3155. In the future, high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic follow-up will be required to validate Pan-STARRS lens candidates and derive strong lensing models. We also expect that the efficient and automated two-step classification method presented in this paper will be applicable to the ∼4 mag deeper gri stacks from the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) with minor adjustments.",,[]

"HOLISMOKES. I. Highly Optimised Lensing Investigations of Supernovae, Microlensing Objects, and Kinematics of Ellipticals and Spirals","We present the HOLISMOKES programme on strong gravitational lensing of supernovae (SNe) as a probe of SN physics and cosmology. We investigate the effects of microlensing on early-phase SN Ia spectra using four different SN explosion models. We find that distortions of SN Ia spectra due to microlensing are typically negligible within ten rest-frame days after a SN explosion (< 1% distortion within the 1σ spread and ≲10% distortion within the 2σ spread). This shows the great prospects of using lensed SNe Ia to obtain intrinsic early-phase SN spectra for deciphering SN Ia progenitors. As a demonstration of the usefulness of lensed SNe Ia for cosmology, we simulate a sample of mock lensed SN Ia systems that are expected to have accurate and precise time-delay measurements in the era of the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Adopting realistic yet conservative uncertainties on their time-delay distances and lens angular diameter distances, of 6.6% and 5%, respectively, we find that a sample of 20 lensed SNe Ia would allow us to constrain the Hubble constant (H<SUB>0</SUB>) with 1.3% uncertainty in the flat ΛCDM cosmology. We find a similar constraint on H<SUB>0</SUB> in an open ΛCDM cosmology, while the constraint degrades to 3% in a flat wCDM cosmology.

Euclid: Identification of asteroid streaks in simulated images using StreakDet software,"Context. The ESA Euclid space telescope could observe up to 150 000 asteroids as a side product of its primary cosmological mission. Asteroids appear as trailed sources, that is streaks, in the images. Owing to the survey area of 15 000 square degrees and the number of sources, automated methods have to be used to find them. Euclid is equipped with a visible camera, VIS (VISual imager), and a near-infrared camera, NISP (Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer), with three filters.",,[]
"Aims: We aim to develop a pipeline to detect fast-moving objects in Euclid images, with both high completeness and high purity.",,,[]
"Methods: We tested the StreakDet software to find asteroids from simulated Euclid images. We optimized the parameters of StreakDet to maximize completeness, and developed a post-processing algorithm to improve the purity of the sample of detected sources by removing false-positive detections.",,,[]
"Results: StreakDet finds 96.9% of the synthetic asteroid streaks with apparent magnitudes brighter than 23rd magnitude and streak lengths longer than 15 pixels (10 arcsec h<SUP>-1</SUP>), but this comes at the cost of finding a high number of false positives. The number of false positives can be radically reduced with multi-streak analysis, which utilizes all four dithers obtained by Euclid.",,,[]
"Conclusions: StreakDet is a good tool for identifying asteroids in Euclid images, but there is still room for improvement, in particular, for finding short (less than 13 pixels, corresponding to 8 arcsec h<SUP>-1</SUP>) and/or faint streaks (fainter than the apparent magnitude of 23).",,,[]

Strongly Lensed Supernovae in Well-Studied Galaxy Clusters with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory,"Strong lensing by galaxy clusters can be used to significantly expand the survey reach, thus allowing observation of magnified high-redshift supernovae that otherwise would remain undetected. Strong lensing can also provide multiple images of the galaxies that lie behind the clusters. Detection of strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is especially useful because of their standardizable brightness, as they can be used to improve either cluster lensing models or independent measurements of cosmological parameters. The cosmological parameter, the Hubble constant, is of particular interest given the discrepancy regarding its value from measurements with different approaches. Here, we explore the feasibility of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of detecting strongly lensed SNe in the field of five galaxy clusters (Abell 1689 and Hubble Frontier Fields clusters) that have well-studied lensing models. Considering the 88 systems composed of 268 individual multiple images in the five cluster fields, we find that the LSST will be sensitive to SNe~Ia (SNe~IIP) exploding in 41 (23) galaxy images. The range of redshift of these galaxies is between $1.01 < z < 3.05$. During its 10 years of operation, LSST is expected to detect $0.2\pm0.1$ SN~Ia and $0.9\pm0.3$ core collapse SNe. However, as LSST will observe many more massive galaxy clusters, it is likely that the expectations are higher. We stress the importance of having an additional observing program for photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of the strongly lensed SNe detected by LSST.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020Symm...12.1966P,[]
The electromagnetic counterparts of compact binary mergers,"Mergers of binaries consisting of two neutron stars, or a black hole and a neutron star, offer a unique opportunity to study a range of physical and astrophysical processes using two different and almost orthogonal probes - gravitational waves (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) emission. The GW signal probes the binary and the physical processes that take place during the last stages of the merger, while the EM emission provides clues to the material that is thrown out following the merger. The accurate localization, which only the EM emission can provide, also indicates the astrophysical setting in which the merger took place. In addition, the combination of the two signals provides constraints on the nature of gravity and on the expansion rate of the Universe. The first detection of a binary neutron star merger by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, GW170817, initiated the era of multi-messenger GW-EM astrophysics and demonstrated the great promise it holds. The event produced an unprecedented data set, and although it was only a single event, it provided remarkable results that revolutionized our knowledge of neutron star mergers. GW170817 is especially exciting since we know that it is not one of a kind and that many more events will be detected during the next decade. In this review, I summarize, first, the theory of EM emission from compact binary mergers, highlighting the unique information that the combined GW-EM detection provides. I then describe the entire set of GW and EM observations of GW170817, and summarize the range of insights that it offers. This includes clues about the role that similar events play in the r-process elements budget of the Universe, the neutron star equation of state, the properties of the relativistic outflow that followed the merger, and the connection between neutron star binary mergers and short gamma-ray bursts. I conclude by discussing some of the future prospects of this new window that has been opened.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhR...886....1N,[]

We analyze 44,971 Evryscope-South light curves in search of variability. We recover 615 variables, with 378 previously known, and 237 new discoveries including 84 young eclipsing binaries (EB) candidates. We discover a new highly eccentric binary system and recover a further four previously known systems, with periods ranging from 299 to 674 hr. We find 158 long-period (>50 hr) candidate EB systems, 9 from the PMS and 149 from the UMS, which will allow constraints on the mass/radius/age relation. These long-period EBs include a 179.3 hr PMS system and a 867.8 hr system from the UMS. For PMS variable candidates we estimate system ages, which range from 1 to 23 Myr for non-EBs and from 2 to 17 Myr for EBs. Other non-EB discoveries that show intrinsic variability will allow relationships between stellar rotation rates, ages, activity, and mass to be characterized.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132k4202G,[]
SN 2018gjx reveals that some SNe Ibn are SNe IIb exploding in dense circumstellar material,"We present the data and analysis of SN 2018gjx, an unusual low-luminosity transient with three distinct spectroscopic phases. Phase I shows a hot blue spectrum with signatures of ionized circumstellar material (CSM), Phase II has the appearance of broad SN features, consistent with those seen in a Type IIb supernova at maximum light, and Phase III is that of a supernova interacting with helium-rich CSM, similar to a Type Ibn supernova. This event provides an apparently rare opportunity to view the inner workings of an interacting supernova. The observed properties can be explained by the explosion of a star in an aspherical CSM. The initial light is emitted from an extended CSM (~4000 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>), which ionizes the exterior unshocked material. Some days after, the SN photosphere envelops this region, leading to the appearance of a SN IIb. Over time, the photosphere recedes in velocity space, revealing interaction between the supernova ejecta and the CSM that partially obscures the supernova nebular phase. Modelling of the initial spectrum reveals a surface composition consistent with compact H-deficient Wolf-Rayet and Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stars. Such configurations may not be unusual, with SNe IIb being known to have signs of interaction so at least some SNe IIb and SNe Ibn may be the same phenomena viewed from different angles, or possibly with differing CSM configurations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499.1450P,[]
Density-based outlier scoring on Kepler data,"In the present era of large-scale surveys, big data present new challenges to the discovery process for anomalous data. Such data can be indicative of systematic errors, extreme (or rare) forms of known phenomena, or most interestingly, truly novel phenomena that exhibit as-of-yet unobserved behaviours. In this work, we present an outlier scoring methodology to identify and characterize the most promising unusual sources to facilitate discoveries of such anomalous data. We have developed a data mining method based on k-nearest neighbour distance in feature space to efficiently identify the most anomalous light curves. We test variations of this method including using principal components of the feature space, removing select features, the effect of the choice of k, and scoring to subset samples. We evaluate the performance of our scoring on known object classes and find that our scoring consistently scores rare (<1000) object classes higher than common classes. We have applied scoring to all long cadence light curves of Quarters 1-17 of Kepler's prime mission and present outlier scores for all 2.8 million light curves for the roughly 200k objects.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499..524G,[]
"An outflow powers the optical rise of the nearby, fast-evolving tidal disruption event AT2019qiz","At 66 Mpc, AT2019qiz is the closest optical tidal disruption event (TDE) to date, with a luminosity intermediate between the bulk of the population and the faint-and-fast event iPTF16fnl. Its proximity allowed a very early detection and triggering of multiwavelength and spectroscopic follow-up well before maximum light. The velocity dispersion of the host galaxy and fits to the TDE light curve indicate a black hole mass ≈10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, disrupting a star of ≈1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. By analysing our comprehensive UV, optical, and X-ray data, we show that the early optical emission is dominated by an outflow, with a luminosity evolution L ∝ t<SUP>2</SUP>, consistent with a photosphere expanding at constant velocity (≳2000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), and a line-forming region producing initially blueshifted H and He II profiles with v = 3000-10 000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The fastest optical ejecta approach the velocity inferred from radio detections (modelled in a forthcoming companion paper from K. D. Alexander et al.), thus the same outflow may be responsible for both the fast optical rise and the radio emission - the first time this connection has been observed in a TDE. The light-curve rise begins 29 ± 2 d before maximum light, peaking when the photosphere reaches the radius where optical photons can escape. The photosphere then undergoes a sudden transition, first cooling at constant radius then contracting at constant temperature. At the same time, the blueshifts disappear from the spectrum and Bowen fluorescence lines (N III) become prominent, implying a source of far-UV photons, while the X-ray light curve peaks at ≈10<SUP>41</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Assuming that these X-rays are from prompt accretion, the size and mass of the outflow are consistent with the reprocessing layer needed to explain the large optical to X-ray ratio in this and other optical TDEs, possibly favouring accretion-powered over collision-powered outflow models.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.499..482N,[]
The tidal disruption event AT 2018hyz - I. Double-peaked emission lines and a flat Balmer decrement,"We present results from spectroscopic observations of AT 2018hyz, a transient discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernova survey at an absolute magnitude of M<SUB>V</SUB> ~ -20.2 mag, in the nucleus of a quiescent galaxy with strong Balmer absorption lines. AT 2018hyz shows a blue spectral continuum and broad emission lines, consistent with previous TDE candidates. High cadence follow-up spectra show broad Balmer lines and He I in early spectra, with He II making an appearance after ~70-100 d. The Balmer lines evolve from a smooth broad profile, through a boxy, asymmetric double-peaked phase consistent with accretion disc emission, and back to smooth at late times. The Balmer lines are unlike typical active galactic nucleus in that they show a flat Balmer decrement (Hα/Hβ ~ 1.5), suggesting the lines are collisionally excited rather than being produced via photoionization. The flat Balmer decrement together with the complex profiles suggests that the emission lines originate in a disc chromosphere, analogous to those seen in cataclysmic variables. The low optical depth of material due to a possible partial disruption may be what allows us to observe these double-peaked, collisionally excited lines. The late appearance of He II may be due to an expanding photosphere or outflow, or late-time shocks in debris collisions.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.498.4119S,[]
"Unsupervised machine learning for transient discovery in deeper, wider, faster light curves","Identification of anomalous light curves within time-domain surveys is often challenging. In addition, with the growing number of wide-field surveys and the volume of data produced exceeding astronomers' ability for manual evaluation, outlier and anomaly detection is becoming vital for transient science. We present an unsupervised method for transient discovery using a clustering technique and the ASTRONOMALY package. As proof of concept, we evaluate 85 553 min-cadenced light curves collected over two ~1.5 h periods as part of the Deeper, Wider, Faster program, using two different telescope dithering strategies. By combining the clustering technique HDBSCAN with the isolation forest anomaly detection algorithm via the visual interface of ASTRONOMALY, we are able to rapidly isolate anomalous sources for further analysis. We successfully recover the known variable sources, across a range of catalogues from within the fields, and find a further seven uncatalogued variables and two stellar flare events, including a rarely observed ultrafast flare (~5 min) from a likely M-dwarf.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.498.3077W,[]
Constraining the host galaxy halos of massive black holes from LISA event rates,"The coalescence of massive black hole binaries (with masses 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>) leads to gravitational wave emission that is detectable out to high redshifts (0z ~ 2) with the forthcoming LISA observatory. We combine the theoretically derived merger rates for dark matter haloes at various redshifts, with an empirically motivated prescription that connects the mass of a dark matter halo and that of its central black hole. Using the expected constraints on the (chirp or reduced) masses of binary black holes, their mass ratios and redshift uncertainties, we forecast the measurement precision on the occupation fraction, normalization and slope of the black hole mass-halo mass relation at various redshifts, assuming a five-year LISA survey for three different confidence scenarios. We use the expected sizes of the LISA localization ellipses on the sky to estimate the number of electromagnetic counterparts to the gravitational wave sources which are detectable by future wide-field optical surveys, such as LSST.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020JCAP...11..055P,[]
FLEET: A Redshift-agnostic Machine Learning Pipeline to Rapidly Identify Hydrogen-poor Superluminous Supernovae,"Over the past decade wide-field optical time-domain surveys have increased the discovery rate of transients to the point that ≲10% are being spectroscopically classified. Despite this, these surveys have enabled the discovery of new and rare types of transients, most notably the class of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSN-I), with about 150 events confirmed to date. Here we present a machine-learning classification algorithm targeted at rapid identification of a pure sample of SLSN-I to enable spectroscopic and multiwavelength follow-up. This algorithm is part of the Finding Luminous and Exotic Extragalactic Transients (FLEET) observational strategy. It utilizes both light-curve and contextual information, but without the need for a redshift, to assign each newly discovered transient a probability of being a SLSN-I. This classifier can achieve a maximum purity of about 85% (with 20% completeness) when observing a selection of SLSN-I candidates. Additionally, we present two alternative classifiers that use either redshifts or complete light curves and can achieve an even higher purity and completeness. At the current discovery rate, the FLEET algorithm can provide about 20 SLSN-I candidates per year for spectroscopic follow-up with 85% purity; with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time we anticipate this will rise to more than $\sim {10}^{3}$ events per year.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...904...74G,[]
Stars Stripped in Binaries: The Living Gravitational-wave Sources,"Binary interaction can cause stellar envelopes to be stripped, which significantly reduces the radius of the star. The orbit of a binary composed of a stripped star and a compact object can therefore be so tight that the gravitational radiation the system produces reaches frequencies accessible to the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Two such stripped stars in tight orbits with white dwarfs are known so far (ZTF J2130+4420 and CD-30°11223), but many more are expected to exist. These binaries provide important constraints for binary evolution models and may be used as LISA verification sources. We develop a Monte Carlo code that uses detailed evolutionary models to simulate the Galactic population of stripped stars in tight orbits with either neutron star or white dwarf companions. We predict 0-100 stripped star + white dwarf binaries and 0-4 stripped star + neutron star binaries with a signal-to-noise ratio >5 after 10 yr of observations with LISA. More than 90% of these binaries are expected to show large radial velocity shifts of ≳200 $\,\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ , which are spectroscopically detectable. Photometric variability due to tidal deformation of the stripped star is also expected and has been observed in ZTF J2130+4420 and CD-30°11223. In addition, the stripped star + neutron star binaries are expected to be X-ray bright with L<SUB>X</SUB> ≳ 10<SUP>33</SUP>-10<SUP>36</SUP> $\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ .

The Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey. II. A Public Statistical Sample for Exploring Supernova Demographics,"We present a public catalog of transients from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey, a magnitude-limited (m < 19 mag in either the g or r filter) survey for extragalactic transients in the ZTF public stream. We introduce cuts on survey coverage, sky visibility around peak light, and other properties unconnected to the nature of the transient, and show that the resulting statistical sample is spectroscopically 97% complete at <18 mag, 93% complete at <18.5 mag, and 75% complete at <19 mag. We summarize the fundamental properties of this population, identifying distinct duration-luminosity correlations in a variety of supernova (SN) classes and associating the majority of fast optical transients with well-established spectroscopic SN types (primarily SN Ibn and II/IIb). We measure the Type Ia SN and core-collapse (CC) SN rates and luminosity functions, which show good consistency with recent work. About 7% of CC SNe explode in very low-luminosity galaxies (M<SUB>i</SUB> > -16 mag), 10% in red-sequence galaxies, and 1% in massive ellipticals. We find no significant difference in the luminosity or color distributions between the host galaxies of SNe Type II and SNe Type Ib/c, suggesting that line-driven wind stripping does not play a major role in the loss of the hydrogen envelope from their progenitors. Future large-scale classification efforts with ZTF and other wide-area surveys will provide high-quality measurements of the rates, properties, and environments of all known types of optical transients and limits on the existence of theoretically predicted but as yet unobserved explosions. * An interactive catalog with all data used in this paper is available at https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/ztf/bts and is updated in real time.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...904...35P,[]
High-energy Neutrinos and Gamma Rays from Nonrelativistic Shock-powered Transients,"Shock interaction has been argued to play a role in powering a range of optical transients, including supernovae, classical novae, stellar mergers, tidal disruption events, and fast blue optical transients. These same shocks can accelerate relativistic ions, generating high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray emission via hadronic pion production. The recent discovery of time-correlated optical and gamma-ray emission in classical novae has revealed the important role of radiative shocks in powering these events, enabling an unprecedented view of the properties of ion acceleration, including its efficiency and energy spectrum, under similar physical conditions to shocks in extragalactic transients. Here we introduce a model for connecting the radiated optical fluence of nonrelativistic transients to their maximal neutrino and gamma-ray fluence. We apply this technique to a wide range of extragalactic transient classes in order to place limits on their contributions to the cosmological high-energy gamma-ray and neutrino backgrounds. Based on a simple model for diffusive shock acceleration at radiative shocks, calibrated to novae, we demonstrate that several of the most luminous transients can accelerate protons up to 10<SUP>16</SUP> eV, sufficient to contribute to the IceCube astrophysical background. Furthermore, several of the considered sources—particularly hydrogen-poor supernovae—may serve as ""gamma-ray-hidden"" neutrino sources owing to the high gamma-ray opacity of their ejecta, evading constraints imposed by the nonblazar Fermi Large Area Telescope background. However, adopting an ion acceleration efficiency of ∼0.3%-1% motivated by nova observations, we find that currently known classes of nonrelativistic, potentially shock-powered transients contribute at most a few percent of the total IceCube background.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...904....4F,[]
Orbital Foregrounds for Ultra-short Duration Transients,"Reflections from objects in Earth orbit can produce subsecond, star-like optical flashes similar to astrophysical transients. Reflections have historically caused false alarms for transient surveys, but the population has not been systematically studied. We report event rates for these orbital flashes using the Evryscope Fast Transient Engine, a low-latency transient detection pipeline for the Evryscopes. We select single-epoch detections likely caused by Earth satellites and model the event rate as a function of both magnitude and sky position. We measure a rate of ${1800}_{-280}^{+600}$ sky<SUP>-1</SUP> hr<SUP>-1</SUP>, peaking at m<SUB>g</SUB> = 13.0, for flashes morphologically degenerate with real astrophysical signals in surveys like the Evryscopes. Of these, ${340}_{-85}^{+150}$ sky<SUP>-1</SUP> hr<SUP>-1</SUP> are bright enough to be visible to the naked eye in typical suburban skies with a visual limiting magnitude of V ≈ 4. These measurements place the event rate of orbital flashes orders of magnitude higher than the combined rate of public alerts from all active all-sky fast-timescale transient searches, including neutrino, gravitational-wave, gamma-ray, and radio observatories. Short-timescale orbital flashes form a dominating foreground for untriggered searches for fast transients in low-resolution, wide-angle surveys. However, events like fast radio bursts with arcminute-scale localization have a low probability (∼10<SUP>-5</SUP>) of coincidence with an orbital flash, allowing optical surveys to place constraints on their potential optical counterparts in single images. Upcoming satellite internet constellations, like SpaceX Starlink, are unlikely to contribute significantly to the population of orbital flashes in normal operations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...903L..27C,[]
A Non-equipartition Shock Wave Traveling in a Dense Circumstellar Environment around SN 2020oi,"We report the discovery and panchromatic follow-up observations of the young Type Ic supernova (SN Ic) SN 2020oi in M100, a grand-design spiral galaxy at a mere distance of 14 Mpc. We followed up with observations at radio, X-ray, and optical wavelengths from only a few days to several months after explosion. The optical behavior of the supernova is similar to those of other normal SNe Ic. The event was not detected in the X-ray band but our radio observations revealed a bright mJy source ( ${L}_{\nu }\approx 1.2\times {10}^{27}\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\,{\mathrm{Hz}}^{-1}$ ). Given the relatively small number of stripped envelope SNe for which radio emission is detectable, we used this opportunity to perform a detailed analysis of the comprehensive radio data set we obtained. The radio-emitting electrons initially experience a phase of inverse Compton cooling, which leads to steepening of the spectral index of the radio emission. Our analysis of the cooling frequency points to a large deviation from equipartition at the level of ɛ<SUB>e</SUB>/ɛ<SUB>B</SUB> ≳ 200, similar to a few other cases of stripped envelope SNe. Our modeling of the radio data suggests that the shock wave driven by the SN ejecta into the circumstellar matter (CSM) is moving at $\sim 3\times {10}^{4}\,\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ . Assuming a constant mass loss from the stellar progenitor, we find that the mass-loss rate is $\dot{M}\approx 1.4\times {10}^{-4}\,{M}_{\odot }\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$ for an assumed wind velocity of $1000\,\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ .

"Caltech-NRAO Stripe 82 Survey (CNSS). III. The First Radio-discovered Tidal Disruption Event, CNSS J0019+00","We present the discovery of a nuclear transient with the Caltech-NRAO Stripe 82 Survey (CNSS), a dedicated radio transient survey carried out with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). This transient, CNSS J001947.3+003527, exhibited a turn-on over a timescale of ≲1 yr, increasing in flux density at 3 GHz from <0.14 mJy in 2014 February to 4.4 ± 0.1 mJy in 2015 March, reaching a peak luminosity of $5\times {10}^{28}\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\,{\mathrm{Hz}}^{-1}$ around 2015 October. The association of CNSS J0019+00 with the nucleus (Gaia and our very-long baseline interferometry positions are consistent to within 1 pc) of a nearby S0 Seyfert galaxy at 77 Mpc, together with the radio spectral evolution, implies that this transient is most likely a tidal disruption event (TDE). Our equipartition analysis indicates the presence of a ∼15,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> outflow, having energy ∼10<SUP>49</SUP> erg. We derive the radial density profile for the circumnuclear material in the host galaxy to be proportional to R<SUP>-2.5</SUP>. All of these properties suggest resemblance with radio-detected thermal TDEs like ASASSN-14li and XMMSL1 J0740-85. No significant X-ray or optical emission is detected from CNSS J0019+00, although this may simply be due to the thermal emission being weak during our late-time follow-up observations. From the CNSS survey we have obtained the first unbiased measurement of the rate of radio TDEs, R(>500μJy) of about 2 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> deg<SUP>-2</SUP>, or equivalently a volumetric rate of about 10 Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. This rate implies that all-sky radio surveys such as the VLA Sky Survey and those planned with ASKAP, will find many tens of radio TDEs over the next few years.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...903..116A,[]
Deep Modeling of Quasar Variability,"Quasars have long been known as intrinsically variable sources, but the physical mechanism underlying the temporal optical/UV variability is still not well understood. We propose a novel nonparametric method for modeling and forecasting the optical variability of quasars utilizing an AE neural network to gain insight into the underlying processes. The AE is trained with ∼15,000 decade-long quasar light curves obtained by the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey selected with negligible flux contamination from the host galaxy. The AE&'s performance in forecasting the temporal flux variation of quasars is superior to that of the damped random walk process. We find a temporal asymmetry in the optical variability and a novel relation—the amplitude of the variability asymmetry decreases as luminosity and/or black hole mass increases—is suggested with the help of autoencoded features. The characteristics of the variability asymmetry are in agreement with those from the self-organized disk instability model, which predicts that the magnitude of the variability asymmetry decreases as the ratio of the diffusion mass to inflow mass in the accretion disk increases.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...903...54T,[]
Light-time effect detected in fourteen eclipsing binaries,"The available minima timings of 14 selected eclipsing binaries (V1297 Cas, HD 24105, KU Aur, GU CMa, GH Mon, AZ Vel, DI Lyn, DK Her, GQ Dra, V624 Her, V1134 Her, KIC 6187893, V1928 Aql, V2486 Cyg) were collected and analyzed. Using the automatic telescopes, surveys, and satellite data, we derived more than 2500 times of eclipses, accompanied with our own ground-based observations. These data were used to detect the period variations in these multiple systems. The eclipse timing variations were described using the third-body hypothesis and the light-time effect. Their respective periods were derived as 2.5, 16.2, 27, 20, 64, 5.6, 22, 115, 27, 42, 6.9, 11.2, 4.1, and 8.4 years for these systems, respectively. The predicted minimal mass of the third body was calculated for each of the systems, and we discuss here their prospective detectability. The light curves of HD 24105, GH Mon, DK Her, V1134 Her, KIC 6187893, V1928 Aql, and V2486 Cyg were analyzed using the PHOEBE program, resulting in physical parameters of the components. Significant fractions of the third light were detected during the light-curve analysis, supporting our hypothesis of the triple-star nature of all these systems. The majority of these systems (nine out of 14) were already known as visual doubles. Our study shifts them to possible quadruples, what makes them even more interesting.",,[]

Observational constraints on the optical and near-infrared emission from the neutron star-black hole binary merger candidate S190814bv,"Context. Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has rapidly reached maturity, becoming a fundamental observing window for modern astrophysics. The coalescences of a few tens of black hole (BH) binaries have been detected, while the number of events possibly including a neutron star (NS) is still limited to a few. On 2019 August 14, the LIGO and Virgo interferometers detected a high-significance event labelled S190814bv. A preliminary analysis of the GW data suggests that the event was likely due to the merger of a compact binary system formed by a BH and a NS.",,[]
"Aims: In this paper, we present our extensive search campaign aimed at uncovering the potential optical and near infrared electromagnetic counterpart of S190814bv. We found no convincing electromagnetic counterpart in our data. We therefore use our non-detection to place limits on the properties of the putative outflows that could have been produced by the binary during and after the merger.",,,[]
"Methods: Thanks to the three-detector observation of S190814bv, and given the characteristics of the signal, the LIGO and Virgo Collaborations delivered a relatively narrow localisation in low latency - a 50% (90%) credible area of 5 deg<SUP>2</SUP> (23 deg<SUP>2</SUP>) - despite the relatively large distance of 267 ± 52 Mpc. ElectromagNetic counterparts of GRAvitational wave sources at the VEry Large Telescope collaboration members carried out an intensive multi-epoch, multi-instrument observational campaign to identify the possible optical and near infrared counterpart of the event. In addition, the ATLAS, GOTO, GRAWITA-VST, Pan-STARRS, and VINROUGE projects also carried out a search on this event. In this paper, we describe the combined observational campaign of these groups.",,,[]
"Results: Our observations allow us to place limits on the presence of any counterpart and discuss the implications for the kilonova (KN), which was possibly generated by this NS-BH merger, and for the strategy of future searches. The typical depth of our wide-field observations, which cover most of the projected sky localisation probability (up to 99.8%, depending on the night and filter considered), is r ∼ 22 (resp. K ∼ 21) in the optical (resp. near infrared). We reach deeper limits in a subset of our galaxy-targeted observations, which cover a total ∼50% of the galaxy-mass-weighted localisation probability. Altogether, our observations allow us to exclude a KN with large ejecta mass M ≳ 0.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> to a high (> 90%) confidence, and we can exclude much smaller masses in a sub-sample of our observations. This disfavours the tidal disruption of the neutron star during the merger.",,,[]
"Conclusions: Despite the sensitive instruments involved in the campaign, given the distance of S190814bv, we could not reach sufficiently deep limits to constrain a KN comparable in luminosity to AT 2017gfo on a large fraction of the localisation probability. This suggests that future (likely common) events at a few hundred megaparsecs will be detected only by large facilities with both a high sensitivity and large field of view. Galaxy-targeted observations can reach the needed depth over a relevant portion of the localisation probability with a smaller investment of resources, but the number of galaxies to be targeted in order to get a fairly complete coverage is large, even in the case of a localisation as good as that of this event.",,,[]

A multiwavelength interferometric, spectropolarimetric, and photometric observing campaign",Context. Young stars interact with their accretion disk through their strong magnetosphere.,,[]
Aims: We aim to investigate the magnetospheric accretion/ejection process in the young stellar system DoAr 44 (V2062 Oph).,,,[]
"Methods: We monitored the system over several rotational cycles, combining high-resolution spectropolarimetry at both optical and near-IR wavelengths with long-baseline near-IR inteferometry and multicolor photometry.",,,[]
"Results: We derive a rotational period of 2.96 d from the system's light curve, which is dominated by stellar spots. We fully characterize the central star's properties from the high signal-to-noise, high-resolution optical spectra we obtained during the campaign. DoAr 44 is a young 1.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> star, moderately accreting from its disk (Ṁ<SUB>acc</SUB> = 6.5 10<SUP>-9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>), and seen at a low inclination (i ≃ 30°). Several optical and near-IR line profiles probing the accretion funnel flows (Hα, Hβ, HeI 1083 nm, Paβ) and the accretion shock (HeI 587.6 nm) are modulated at the stellar rotation period. The most variable line profile is HeI 1083 nm, which exhibits modulated redshifted wings that are a signature of accretion funnel flows, as well as deep blueshifted absorptions indicative of transient outflows. The Zeeman-Doppler analysis suggests the star hosts a mainly dipolar magnetic field, inclined by about 20° onto the spin axis, with an intensity reaching about 800 G at the photosphere, and up to 2 ± 0.8 kG close to the accretion shock. The magnetic field appears strong enough to disrupt the inner disk close to the corotation radius, at a distance of about 4.6 R<SUB>⋆</SUB> (0.043 au), which is consistent with the 5 R<SUB>⋆</SUB> (0.047 au) upper limit we derived for the size of the magnetosphere in our Paper I from long baseline interferometry.",,,[]
"Conclusions: DoAr 44 is a pre-transitional disk system, exhibiting a 25-30 au gap in its circumstellar disk, with the inner and outer disks being misaligned. On a scale of 0.1 au or less, our results indicate that the system is steadily accreting from its inner disk through its tilted dipolar magnetosphere. We conclude that in spite of a highly structured disk on the large scale, perhaps the signature of ongoing planetary formation, the magnetospheric accretion process proceeds unimpeded at the star-disk interaction level.",,,[]

Two stripped envelope supernovae with circumstellar interaction. But only one really shows it,"Context. We present observations of SN 2019tsf (ZTF19ackjszs) and SN 2019oys (ZTF19abucwzt). These two stripped envelope (SE) Type Ib supernovae (SNe) suddenly showed a (re-)brightening in their late light curves. We investigate this in the context of circumstellar material (CSM) interaction with previously ejected material, a phenomenon that is unusual among SE SNe.",,[]
"Aims: We use our follow-up photometry and spectroscopy for these supernovae to demonstrate the presence of CSM interaction, estimate the properties of the CSM, and discuss why the signals are so different for the two objects.",,,[]
"Methods: We present and analyze observational data, consisting of optical light curves and spectra. For SN 2019oys, we also have detections in radio as well as limits from UV and X-rays.",,,[]
"Results: Both light curves show spectacular re-brightening after about 100 days. In the case of SN 2019tsf, the re-brightening is followed by a new period of decline, and the spectra never show signs of narrow emission lines that would indicate CSM interaction. On the contrary, SN 2019oys made a spectral makeover from a Type Ib to a spectrum clearly dominated by CSM interaction at the light curve brightening phase. Deep Keck spectra reveal a plethora of narrow high-ionization lines, including coronal lines, and the radio observations show strong emission.",,,[]
"Conclusions: The rather similar light curve behavior - with a late linear re-brightening - of these two Type Ib SE SNe indicate CSM interaction as the powering source. For SN 2019oys the evidence for a phase where the ejecta hit H-rich material, likely ejected from the progenitor star, is conspicuous. We observe strong narrow lines of H and He, but also a plethora of high-ionization lines, including coronal lines, revealing shock interaction. Spectral simulations of SN 2019oys show two distinct density components, one with density ≳10<SUP>9</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, dominated by somewhat broader, low-ionization lines of H I, He I, Na I, and Ca II, and one with narrow, high-ionization lines at a density ∼10<SUP>6</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. The former is strongly affected by electron scattering, while the latter is unaffected. The evidence for CSM interaction in SN 2019oys is corroborated by detections in radio. On the contrary, for SN 2019tsf, we find little evidence in the spectra for any CSM interaction.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A&A...643A..79S,,[]
First systematic high-precision survey of bright supernovae. I. Methodology for identifying early bumps,"Rapid variability before and near the maximum brightness of supernovae has the potential to provide a better understanding of nearly every aspect of supernovae, from the physics of the explosion up to their progenitors and the circumstellar environment. Thanks to modern time-domain optical surveys, which are discovering supernovae in the early stage of their evolution, we have the unique opportunity to capture their intraday behavior before maximum. We present high-cadence photometric monitoring (on the order of seconds-minutes) of the optical light curves of three Type Ia and two Type II SNe over several nights before and near maximum light, using the fast imagers available on the 2.3 m Aristarchos telescope at Helmos Observatory and the 1.2 m telescope at Kryoneri Observatory in Greece. We applied differential aperture photometry techniques using optimal apertures and we present reconstructed light curves after implementing a seeing correction and the Trend Filtering Algorithm (TFA, Kovács et al. 2005, MNRAS, 356, 557). TFA yielded the best results, achieving a typical precision between 0.01 and 0.04 mag. We did not detect significant bumps with amplitudes greater than 0.05 mag in any of the SNe targets in the VR-, R-, and I-bands light curves obtained. We measured the intraday slope for each light curve, which ranges between -0.37-0.36 mag day<SUP>-1</SUP> in broadband VR, -0.19-0.31 mag day<SUP>-1</SUP> in R band, and -0.13-0.10 mag day<SUP>-1</SUP> in I band. We used SNe light curve fitting templates for SN 2018gv, SN 2018hgc and SN 2018hhn to photometrically classify the light curves and to calculate the time of maximum. We provide values for the maximum of SN 2018zd after applying a low-order polynomial fit and SN 2018hhn for the first time. We conclude that optimal aperture photometry in combination with TFA provides the highest-precision light curves for SNe that are relatively well separated from the centers of their host galaxies. This work aims to inspire the use of ground-based, high-cadence and high-precision photometry to study SNe with the purpose of revealing clues and properties of the explosion environment of both core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae, the explosion mechanisms, binary star interaction and progenitor channels. We suggest monitoring early supernovae light curves in hotter (bluer) bands with a cadence of hours as a promising way of investigating the post-explosion photometric behavior of the progenitor stars.",,[]

Optical-Ultraviolet Tidal Disruption Events,"The existence of optical-ultraviolet Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) could be considered surprising because their electromagnetic output was originally predicted to be dominated by X-ray emission from an accretion disk. Yet over the last decade, the growth of optical transient surveys has led to the identification of a new class of optical transients occurring exclusively in galaxy centers, many of which are considered to be TDEs. Here we review the observed properties of these events, identified based on a shared set of both photometric and spectroscopic properties. We present a homogeneous analysis of 33 sources that we classify as robust TDEs, and which we divide into classes. The criteria used here to classify TDEs will possibly get updated as new samples are collected and potential additional diversity of TDEs is revealed. We also summarize current measurements of the optical-ultraviolet TDE rate, as well as the mass function and luminosity function. Many open questions exist regarding the current sample of events. We anticipate that the search for answers will unlock new insights in a variety of fields, from accretion physics to galaxy evolution.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020SSRv..216..124V,[]
Observational signatures of close binaries of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei,"Inspired by the General Relativity for many decades, experimental physicists and astronomers have a solid dream to detect gravitational waves (GWs) from mergers of black holes, which came true until the excellent performance of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) at hundreds Hz. Nano-Hz GWs are expected to be radiated by close-binaries of supermassive black holes (CB-SMBHs; defined as those with separations less than ∼0.1 pc) formed during galaxy mergers and detected through the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) technique. As of the writing, there remains no nano-Hz GWs detection. Searching for CB-SMBHs is also observationally elusive though there exist a number of possible candidates. In this review, we focus on observational signatures of CB-SMBHs from theoretic expectations, simulations and observations. These signatures appear in energy distributions of multiwavelength continuum, long term variations of continuum, jet morphology, reverberation delay maps and spectroastrometry of broad emission lines, AGN type transitions between type-1 and type-2 (changing-look), and gaseous dynamics of circumbinary disks, etc. Unlike hundred-Hz GWs from stellar mass black hole binaries, the waveform chirping of nano-Hz GWs is too slow to detect in a reasonable human timescale. We have to resort to electromagnetic observations to measure orbital parameters of CB-SMBHs to test nano-Hz GW properties. Reverberation mapping is a powerful tool for probing kinematics and geometry of ionized gas in the gravitational well of SMBHs (single or binary) and therefore provides a potential way to determine orbital parameters of CB-SMBHs. In particular, a combination of reverberation mapping with spectroastrometry (realized at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer) will further reinforce this capability. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are suggested to reveal dynamics of circumbinary disks through molecular emission lines.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020RAA....20..160W,[]
Neutrino emission from an off-axis jet driven by the tidal disruption event AT2019dsg,"Recently, a high-energy muon neutrino event was detected in association with a tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2019dsg at the time about 150 days after the peak of the optical/UV luminosity. We propose that such an association could be interpreted as arising from hadronic interactions between relativistic protons accelerated in the jet launched from the TDE and the intense radiation field of TDE inside the optical/UV photosphere, if we are observing the jet at a moderate angle (i.e., approximately 10 ° -3 0 ° ) with respect to the jet axis. Such an off-axis viewing angle leads to a high gas column density in the line of sight, which provides a high opacity for the photoionization and the Bethe-Heitler process and allows the existence of an intrinsic long-term x-ray radiation of comparatively high emissivity. As a result, the cascade emission accompanying the neutrino production, which would otherwise overshoot the flux limits in the x-ray and/or GeV band, is significantly obscured or absorbed. Since the jets of TDEs are supposed to be randomly oriented in the sky, the source density rate of TDE with an off-axis jet is significantly higher than that of TDE with an on-axis jet. Therefore, an off-axis jet is naturally expected in a nearby TDE being discovered, supporting the proposed scenario.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhRvD.102h3028L,[]
GWOPS: A VO-technology Driven Tool to Search for the Electromagnetic Counterpart of Gravitational Wave Event,"The search and follow-up observation of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of gravitational waves (GW) is a current hot topic of GW cosmology. Due to the limitation of the accuracy of the GW observation facility at this stage, we can only get a rough sky-localization region for the GW event, and the typical area of the region is between 200 and 1500 square degrees. Since GW events occur in or near galaxies, limiting the observation target to galaxies can significantly speedup searching for EM counterparts. Therefore, how to efficiently select host galaxy candidates in such a large GW localization region, how to arrange the observation sequence, and how to efficiently identify the GW source from observational data are the problems that need to be solved. International Virtual Observatory Alliance has developed a series of technical standards for data retrieval, interoperability and visualization. Based on the application of VO technologies, we construct the GW follow-up Observation Planning System (GWOPS). It consists of three parts: a pipeline to select host candidates of GW and sort their priorities for follow-up observation, an identification module to find the transient from follow-up observation data, and a visualization module to display GW-related data. GWOPS can rapidly respond to GW events. With GWOPS, the operations such as follow-up observation planning, data storage, data visualization, and transient identification can be efficiently coordinated, which will promote the success searching rate for GWs EM counterparts.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132j4501X,[]
Exocomets from a Solar System Perspective,"Exocomets are small bodies releasing gas and dust which orbit stars other than the Sun. Their existence was first inferred from the detection of variable absorption features in stellar spectra in the late 1980s using spectroscopy. More recently, they have been detected through photometric transits from space, and through far-IR/mm gas emission within debris disks. As (exo)comets are considered to contain the most pristine material accessible in stellar systems, they hold the potential to give us information about early stage formation and evolution conditions of extra solar systems. In the solar system, comets carry the physical and chemical memory of the protoplanetary disk environment where they formed, providing relevant information on processes in the primordial solar nebula. The aim of this paper is to compare essential compositional properties between solar system comets and exocomets to allow for the development of new observational methods and techniques. The paper aims to highlight commonalities and to discuss differences which may aid the communication between the involved research communities and perhaps also avoid misconceptions. The compositional properties of solar system comets and exocomets are summarized before providing an observational comparison between them. Exocomets likely vary in their composition depending on their formation environment like solar system comets do, and since exocomets are not resolved spatially, they pose a challenge when comparing them to high fidelity observations of solar system comets. Observations of gas around main sequence stars, spectroscopic observations of ""polluted"" white dwarf atmospheres and spectroscopic observations of transiting exocomets suggest that exocomets may show compositional similarities with solar system comets. The recent interstellar visitor 2I/Borisov showed gas, dust and nuclear properties similar to that of solar system comets. This raises the tantalising prospect that observations of interstellar comets may help bridge the fields of exocomet and solar system comets.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132j1001S,[]
Photometric classification of Hyper Suprime-Cam transients using machine learning,"The advancement of technology has resulted in a rapid increase in supernova (SN) discoveries. The Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) transient survey, conducted from fall 2016 through spring 2017, yielded 1824 SN candidates. This gave rise to the need for fast type classification for spectroscopic follow-up and prompted us to develop a machine learning algorithm using a deep neural network with highway layers. This algorithm is trained by actual observed cadence and filter combinations such that we can directly input the observed data array without any interpretation. We tested our model with a dataset from the LSST classification challenge (Deep Drilling Field). Our classifier scores an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.996 for binary classification (SN Ia or non-SN Ia) and 95.3% accuracy for three-class classification (SN Ia, SN Ibc, or SN II). Application of our binary classification to HSC transient data yields an AUC score of 0.925. With two weeks of HSC data since the first detection, this classifier achieves 78.1% accuracy for binary classification, and the accuracy increases to 84.2% with the full dataset. This paper discusses the potential use of machine learning for SN type classification purposes.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASJ...72...89T,[]
The host galaxies of 106 rapidly evolving transients discovered by the Dark Energy Survey,"Rapidly evolving transients (RETs), also termed fast blue optical transients, are a recently discovered group of astrophysical events that display rapid luminosity evolution. RETs typically rise to peak in less than 10 d and fade within 30, a time-scale unlikely to be compatible with the decay of Nickel-56 that drives conventional supernovae (SNe). Their peak luminosity spans a range of -15 < M<SUB>g</SUB> < -22.5, with some events observed at redshifts greater than 1. Their evolution on fast time-scales has hindered high-quality follow-up observations, and thus their origin and explosion/emission mechanism remains unexplained. In this paper, we present the largest sample of RETs to date, comprising 106 objects discovered by the Dark Energy Survey, and perform the most comprehensive analysis of RET host galaxies. Using deep-stacked photometry and emission lines from OzDES spectroscopy, we derive stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) for 49 host galaxies, and metallicities ([O/H]) for 37. We find that RETs explode exclusively in star-forming galaxies and are thus likely associated with massive stars. Comparing RET hosts to samples of host galaxies of other explosive transients as well as field galaxies, we find that RETs prefer galaxies with high specific SFRs (⟨log (sSFR)⟩ ~ -9.6), indicating a link to young stellar populations, similar to stripped-envelope SNe. RET hosts appear to show a lack of chemical enrichment, their metallicities akin to long-duration gamma-ray bursts and superluminous SN host galaxies (⟨12 + log (O/H)⟩ ~ 9.4). There are no clear relationships between mass or SFR of the host galaxies and the peak magnitudes or decline rates of the transients themselves.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.498.2575W,[]
The first high-redshift changing-look quasars,"We report on three redshift z > 2 quasars with dramatic changes in their C IV emission lines, the first sample of changing-look quasars (CLQs) at high redshift. This is also the first time the changing-look behaviour has been seen in a high-ionization emission line. SDSS J1205+3422, J1638+2827, and J2228 + 2201 show interesting behaviour in their observed optical light curves, and subsequent spectroscopy shows significant changes in the C IV broad emission line, with both line collapse and emergence being displayed on rest-frame time-scales of ~240-1640 d. These are rapid changes, especially when considering virial black hole mass estimates of M<SUB>BH</SUB> > 10<SUP>9</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB> for all three quasars. Continuum and emission line measurements from the three quasars show changes in the continuum-equivalent width plane with the CLQs seen to be on the edge of the full population distribution, and showing indications of an intrinsic Baldwin effect. We put these observations in context with recent state-change models, and note that even in their observed low-state, the C IV CLQs are generally above ~5 per cent in Eddington luminosity.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.498.2339R,[]
K2: Background Survey - the search for undiscovered transients in Kepler/K2 data,"The K2 mission of the Kepler Space Telescope offers a unique possibility to examine sources of both Galactic and extragalactic origin with high-cadence photometry. Alongside the multitude of supernovae and quasars detected within targeted galaxies, it is likely that Kepler has serendipitously observed many transients throughout K2. Such events will likely have occurred in background pixels, coincidentally surrounding science targets. Analysing the background pixels presents the possibility to conduct a high-cadence survey with areas of a few square degrees per campaign. We demonstrate the capacity to independently recover key K2 transients such as KSN 2015K and SN 2018oh. With this survey, we expect to detect numerous transients and determine the first comprehensive rates for transients with lifetimes of ≤1 d.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.498...33R,[]
GRANDMA observations of advanced LIGO's and advanced Virgo's third observational campaign,"GRANDMA (Global Rapid Advanced Network Devoted to the Multi-messenger Addicts) is a network of 25 telescopes of different sizes, including both photometric and spectroscopic facilities. The network aims to coordinate follow-up observations of gravitational-wave (GW) candidate alerts, especially those with large localization uncertainties, to reduce the delay between the initial detection and the optical confirmation. In this paper, we detail GRANDMA's observational performance during Advanced LIGO/Advanced Virgo Observing Run 3 (O3), focusing on the second part of O3; this includes summary statistics pertaining to coverage and possible astrophysical origin of the candidates. To do so, we quantify our observation efficiency in terms of delay between GW candidate trigger time, observations, and the total coverage. Using an optimized and robust coordination system, GRANDMA followed-up about 90 per cent of the GW candidate alerts, that is 49 out of 56 candidates. This led to coverage of over 9000 deg<SUP>2</SUP> during O3. The delay between the GW candidate trigger and the first observation was below 1.5 h for 50 per cent of the alerts. We did not detect any electromagnetic counterparts to the GW candidates during O3, likely due to the very large localization areas (on average thousands of degrees squares) and relatively large distance of the candidates (above 200 Mpc for 60 per cent of binary neutron star, BNS candidates). We derive constraints on potential kilonova properties for two potential BNS coalescences (GW190425 and S200213t), assuming that the events' locations were imaged.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.5518A,[]
A multiwavelength search for black widow and redback counterparts of candidate γ-ray millisecond pulsars,"The wealth of detections of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in γ-rays by Fermi has spurred searches for these objects among the several unidentified γ-ray sources. Interesting targets are a sub-class of binary MSPs, dubbed 'black widows' (BWs) and 'redbacks' (RBs), which are in orbit with low-mass non-degenerate companions fully or partially ablated by irradiation from the MSP wind. These systems can be easily missed in radio pulsar surveys owing to the eclipse of the radio signal by the intra-binary plasma from the ablated companion star photosphere, making them better targets for multiwavelength observations. We used optical and X-ray data from public data bases to carry out a systematic investigation of all the unidentified γ-ray sources from the Fermi Large Area Telescope Third Source Catalog, which have been pre-selected as likely MSP candidates according to a machine-learning technique analysis. We tested our procedure by recovering known binary BW/RB identifications and searched for new ones, finding two possible candidates. At the same time, we investigated previously proposed BW/RB identifications and we ruled out one of them based upon the updated γ-ray source coordinates.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.5364B,[]
A survey for variable young stars with small telescopes - III. Warm spots on the active star V1598 Cyg,"Magnetic spots on low-mass stars can be traced and characterized using multiband photometric light curves. Here, we analyse an extensive data set for one active star, V1598 Cyg, a known variable K dwarf which is either pre-main sequence and/or in a close binary system. Our light curve contains 2854 photometric data points, mostly in V, R<SUB>c</SUB>, I<SUB>c</SUB>, but also in U, B, and Hα, with a total baseline of about 4 yr, obtained with small telescopes as part of the HOYS project. We find that V1598 Cyg is a very fast rotator with a period of 0.8246 d and varying amplitudes in all filters, best explained as a signature of strong magnetic activity and spots. We fit the photometric amplitudes in V, R<SUB>c</SUB>, I<SUB>c</SUB> and use them to estimate spot properties, using a grid-based method that is also propagating uncertainties. We verify the method on a partial data set with high cadence and all five broad-band filters. The method yields spot temperatures and fractional spot coverage with typical uncertainties of 100 K and 3-4 per cent, respectively. V1598 Cyg consistently exhibits spots that are a few hundred degrees warmer than the photosphere, most likely indicating that the light curve is dominated by chromospheric plage. The spot activity varies over our observing baseline, with a typical time-scale of 0.5-1 yr, which we interpret as the typical spot lifetime. Combining our light curve with archival data, we find a six year cycle in the average brightness, that is probably a sign of a magnetic activity cycle.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.4602F,[]
Dynamical evolution of two-planet systems and its connection with white dwarf atmospheric pollution,"Asteroid material is detected in white dwarfs (WDs) as atmospheric pollution by metals, in the form of gas/dust discs, or in photometric transits. Within the current paradigm, minor bodies need to be scattered, most likely by planets, into highly eccentric orbits where the material gets disrupted by tidal forces and then accreted on to the star. This can occur through a planet-planet scattering process triggered by the stellar mass-loss during the post main-sequence (MS) evolution of planetary systems. So far, studies of the N-body dynamics of this process have used artificial planetary system architectures built ad hoc. In this work, we attempt to go a step further and study the dynamical instability provided by more restrictive systems that, at the same time, allow us an exploration of a wider parameter space: the hundreds of multiple planetary systems found around MS stars. We find that most of our simulated systems remain stable during the MS, Red, and Asymptotic Giant Branch and for several Gyr into the WD phases of the host star. Overall, only ≈2.3 ${{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the simulated systems lose a planet on the WD as a result of dynamical instability. If the instabilities take place during the WD phase most of them result in planet ejections with just five planetary configurations ending as a collision of a planet with the WD. Finally 3.2 ${{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the simulated systems experience some form of orbital scattering or orbit crossing that could contribute to the pollution at a sustained rate if planetesimals are present in the same system.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.4091M,[]
Gravitational-wave Merger Forecasting: Scenarios for the Early Detection and Localization of Compact-binary Mergers with Ground-based Observatories,"We present the prospects for the early (pre-merger) detection and localization of compact-binary coalescences using gravitational waves over the next 10 yr. Early warning can enable the direct observation of the prompt and early electromagnetic emission of a neutron star merger. We examine the capabilities of the ground-based detectors at their ""Design"" sensitivity (2021-2022), the planned ""A+"" upgrade (2024-2026), and the envisioned ""Voyager"" concept (late 2020s). We find that for a fiducial rate of binary neutron star mergers of 1000 Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, the Design, A+, and Voyager era networks can provide 18, 54, and 195 s of warning for one source per year of observing, respectively, with a sky localization area <100 deg<SUP>2</SUP> at a 90% credible level. At the same rate, the A+ and Voyager era networks will be able to provide 9 and 43 s of warning, respectively, for a source with <10 deg<SUP>2</SUP> localization area. We compare the idealized search sensitivity to that achieved by the PyCBC Live search tuned for pre-merger detection. The gravitational-wave community will be prepared to produce pre-merger alerts. Our results motivate the operation of observatories with wide fields of view, automation, and the capability for fast slewing to observe simultaneously with the gravitational-wave network.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902L..29N,[]
Helium-rich Superluminous Supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility,"Helium is expected to be present in the massive ejecta of some hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSN-I). However, until now only one event has been identified with He features in its photospheric spectra (PTF10hgi). We present the discovery of a new He-rich SLSN-I, ZTF19aawfbtg (SN2019hge), at z = 0.0866. This event has more than 10 optical spectra at phases from -41 to +103 days relative to the peak, most of which match well with that of PTF10hgi. Confirmation comes from a near-IR spectrum taken at +34 days, revealing He I features with P-Cygni profiles at 1.083 and 2.058 μm. Using the optical spectra of PTF10hgi and SN2019hge as templates, we examined 70 other SLSNe-I discovered by Zwicky Transient Facility in the first two years of operation and found five additional SLSNe-I with distinct He-features. The excitation of He I atoms in normal core-collapse supernovae requires nonthermal radiation, as proposed by previous studies. These He-rich events cannot be explained by the traditional <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mixing model because of their blue spectra, high peak luminosities, and long rise timescales. Magnetar models offer a possible solution since pulsar winds naturally generate high-energy particles, potential sources of nonthermal excitation. An alternative model is the interaction between the ejecta and dense H-poor circumstellar material, which may be supported by observed undulations in the light curves. These six SLSNe-Ib have relatively low-peak luminosities (rest frame M<SUB>g</SUB> = -20.06 ± 0.16).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902L...8Y,[]
High-energy Neutrino and Gamma-Ray Emission from Tidal Disruption Events,"Tidal disruption events (TDE) have been considered as cosmic-ray and neutrino sources for a decade. We suggest two classes of new scenarios for high-energy multi-messenger emission from TDEs that do not have to harbor powerful jets. First, we investigate high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray production in the core region of a supermassive black hole. In particular, we show that ∼1-100 TeV neutrinos and MeV gamma rays can efficiently be produced in hot coronae around an accretion disk. We also study the consequences of particle acceleration in radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). Second, we consider possible cosmic-ray acceleration by sub-relativistic disk-driven winds or interactions between tidal streams, and show that subsequent hadronuclear and photohadronic interactions inside the TDE debris lead to GeV-PeV neutrinos and sub-GeV cascade gamma rays. We demonstrate that these models should be accompanied by soft gamma rays or hard X-rays as well as optical/UV emission, which can be used for future observational tests. Although this work aims to present models of non-jetted high-energy emission, we discuss the implications of the TDE AT2019dsg that might coincide with the high-energy neutrino IceCube-191001A, by considering the corona, RIAF, hidden sub-relativistic wind, and hidden jet models. It is not yet possible to be conclusive about their physical association and the expected number of neutrinos is typically much less than unity. We find that the most optimistic cases of the corona and hidden wind models could be consistent with the observation of IceCube-191001A, whereas jet models are unlikely to explain the multi-messenger observations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902..108M,[]
EVR-CB-004: An Inflated Hot Subdwarf O Star + Unseen WD Companion in a Compact Binary Discovered with the Evryscope,"We present the discovery of EVR-CB-004, a close binary with a remnant stellar core and an unseen white dwarf (WD) companion. The analysis in this work reveals that the primary is potentially an inflated hot subdwarf (sdO) and more likely is a rarer post-blue horizontal branch (post-BHB) star. Post-BHBs are the short-lived shell-burning final stage of a blue horizontal star or hot subdwarf before transitioning to a WD. This object was discovered using Evryscope photometric data in a southern all-sky hot subdwarf variability survey. The photometric light curve for EVR-CB-004 shows multicomponent variability from ellipsoidal deformation of the primary and Doppler boosting, as well as gravitational limb darkening. The binary EVR-CB-004 is one of just a handful of known systems and has a long period (6.08426 hr) and large-amplitude ellipsoidal modulation (16.0% change in brightness from maximum to minimum) for these extremely close binary systems, while the properties of the primary make it a truly unique system. It also shows a peculiar low-amplitude (less than 1%) sinusoidal light-curve variation with a period that is a 1/3 resonance of the binary period. We tentatively identify this additional variation source as a tidally induced resonant pulsation, and we suggest follow-up observations that could verify this interpretation. From the evolutionary state of the system, its components, and its mass fraction, EVR-CB-004 is a strong merger candidate to form a single high-mass (≈1.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) WD. It offers a glimpse into a brief phase of remnant core evolution and secondary variation not seen before in a compact binary.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902...92R,[]
SN 2020bvc: A Broad-line Type Ic Supernova with a Double-peaked Optical Light Curve and a Luminous X-Ray and Radio Counterpart,"We present optical, radio, and X-ray observations of SN 2020bvc (=ASASSN-20bs, ZTF 20aalxlis), a nearby ( $z=0.0252;$ d = 114 Mpc) broad-line (BL) Type Ic supernova (SN) and the first double-peaked Ic-BL discovered without a gamma-ray burst (GRB) trigger. Our observations show that SN 2020bvc shares several properties in common with the Ic-BL SN 2006aj, which was associated with the low-luminosity gamma-ray burst (LLGRB) 060218. First, the 10 GHz radio luminosity ( ${L}_{\mathrm{radio}}\approx {10}^{37}\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ ) is brighter than ordinary core-collapse SNe but fainter than LLGRB SNe such as SN 1998bw (associated with LLGRB 980425). We model our VLA observations (spanning 13-43 days) as synchrotron emission from a mildly relativistic (v ≳ 0.3c) forward shock. Second, with Swift and Chandra, we detect X-ray emission (L<SUB>X</SUB> ≈ 10<SUP>41</SUP> erg ${{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ ) that is not naturally explained as inverse Compton emission or part of the same synchrotron spectrum as the radio emission. Third, high-cadence (6× night<SUP>-1</SUP>) data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) show a double-peaked optical light curve, the first peak from shock cooling of extended low-mass material (mass ${M}_{e} {10}^{-2}\,{M}_{\odot }$ at radius R<SUB>e</SUB> > 10<SUP>12</SUP> cm) and the second peak from the radioactive decay of ${}^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ . SN 2020bvc is the first double-peaked Ic-BL SN discovered without a GRB trigger, so it is noteworthy that it shows X-ray and radio emission similar to LLGRB SNe. For four of the five other nearby (z ≲ 0.05) Ic-BL SNe with ZTF high-cadence data, we rule out a first peak like that seen in SN 2006aj and SN 2020bvc, i.e., that lasts ≈1 day and reaches a peak luminosity M ≈ -18. Follow-up X-ray and radio observations of Ic-BL SNe with well-sampled early optical light curves will establish whether double-peaked optical light curves are indeed predictive of LLGRB-like X-ray and radio emission.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902...86H,[]
Localization of Compact Binary Sources with Second-generation Gravitational-wave Interferometer Networks,"GW170817 began gravitational-wave multimessenger astronomy. However, GW170817 will not be representative of detections in the coming years because typical gravitational-wave sources will be closer the detection horizon, have larger localization regions, and (when present) will have correspondingly weaker electromagnetic emission. In its design state, the gravitational-wave detector network in the mid-2020s will consist of up to five similar-sensitivity second-generation interferometers. The instantaneous sky-coverage by the full network is nearly isotropic, in contrast to the configuration during the first three observing runs. Along with the coverage of the sky, there are also commensurate increases in the average horizon for a given binary mass. We present a realistic set of localizations for binary neutron stars and neutron star-black hole binaries, incorporating intra-network duty cycles and selection effects on the astrophysical distributions. Based on the assumption of an 80% duty cycle, and that two instruments observe a signal above the detection threshold, we anticipate a median of 28 sq. deg. for binary neutron stars, and 50-120 sq. deg. for neutron star-black hole (depending on the population assumed). These distributions have a wide spread, and the best localizations, even for networks with fewer instruments, will have localizations of 1-10 sq. deg. range. The full five instrument network reduces localization regions to a few tens of degrees at worst.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902...71P,[]
Star Formation and Morphological Properties of Galaxies in the Pan-STARRS 3π Survey. I. A Machine-learning Approach to Galaxy and Supernova Classification,"We present a classification of galaxies in the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) 3π survey based on their recent star formation history and morphology. Specifically, we train and test two Random Forest (RF) classifiers using photometric features (colors and moments) from the PS1 data release 2. The labels for the morphological classification are taken from Huertas-Company et al., while labels for the star formation fraction (SFF) are from the Blanton et al. catalog. We find that colors provide more predictive accuracy than photometric moments. We morphologically classify galaxies as either early- or late-type, and our RF model achieves a 78% classification accuracy. Our second model classifies galaxies as having either a low-to-moderate or high SFF. This model achieves an 89% classification accuracy. We apply both RF classifiers to the entire PS1 3π dataset, which allows us to assign two scores to each PS1 source: P<SUB>HSFF</SUB>, which quantifies the probability of having a high SFF; and P<SUB>spiral</SUB>, which quantifies the probability of having a late-type morphology. Finally, as a proof of concept, we apply our classification framework to supernova (SN) host galaxies from the Zwicky Transient Factory and the Lick Observatory Supernova Search samples. We show that by selecting P<SUB>HSFF</SUB> or P<SUB>spiral</SUB>, it is possible to significantly enhance or suppress the fraction of core-collapse SNe (or thermonuclear SNe) in the sample with respect to random guessing. This result demonstrates how contextual information can aid transient classifications at the time of first detection. In the current era of spectroscopically starved time-domain astronomy, prompt automated classification is paramount. Our table is available at 10.5281/zenodo.3990545.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902...60B,[]
ZTF Early Observations of Type Ia Supernovae. III. Early-time Colors As a Test for Explosion Models and Multiple Populations,"Colors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the first few days after explosion provide a potential discriminant between different models. In this paper, we present g - r colors of 65 SNe Ia discovered within 5 days from first light by the Zwicky Transient Facility in 2018, a sample that is about three times larger than that in the literature. We find that g - r colors are intrinsically rather homogeneous at early phases, with about half of the dispersion attributable to photometric uncertainties ( ${\sigma }_{\mathrm{noise}}\sim {\sigma }_{\mathrm{int}}\,\sim $ 0.18 mag). Colors are nearly constant starting from 6 days after first light (g - r ∼ -0.15 mag), while the time evolution at earlier epochs is characterized by a continuous range of slopes, from events rapidly transitioning from redder to bluer colors (slope of ∼-0.25 mag day<SUP>-1</SUP>) to events with a flatter evolution. The continuum in the slope distribution is in good agreement both with models requiring some amount of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mixed in the outermost regions of the ejecta and with ""double-detonation"" models having thin helium layers ( ${M}_{\mathrm{He}}=0.01\,{M}_{\odot }$ ) and varying carbon-oxygen core masses. At the same time, six events show evidence for a distinctive ""red bump"" signature predicted by double-detonation models with larger helium masses. We finally identify a significant correlation between the early-time g - r slopes and supernova brightness, with brighter events associated to flatter color evolution (p-value = 0.006). The distribution of slopes, however, is consistent with being drawn from a single population, with no evidence for two components as claimed in the literature based on B - V colors.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902...48B,[]
"ZTF Early Observations of Type Ia Supernovae. II. First Light, the Initial Rise, and Time to Reach Maximum Brightness","While it is clear that Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are the result of thermonuclear explosions in C/O white dwarfs (WDs), a great deal remains uncertain about the binary companion that facilitates the explosive disruption of the WD. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of a large, unique data set of 127 SNe Ia with exquisite coverage by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). High-cadence (six observations per night) ZTF observations allow us to measure the SN rise time and examine its initial evolution. We develop a Bayesian framework to model the early rise as a power law in time, which enables the inclusion of priors in our model. For a volume-limited subset of normal SNe Ia, we find that the mean power-law index is consistent with 2 in the r<SUB>ZTF</SUB>-band ( ${\alpha }_{r}=2.01\pm 0.02$ ), as expected in the expanding fireball model. There are, however, individual SNe that are clearly inconsistent with ${\alpha }_{r}=2$ . We estimate a mean rise time of 18.9 days (with a range extending from ∼15 to 22 days), though this is subject to the adopted prior. We identify an important, previously unknown, bias whereby the rise times for higher-redshift SNe within a flux-limited survey are systematically underestimated. This effect can be partially alleviated if the power-law index is fixed to α = 2, in which case we estimate a mean rise time of 21.7 days (with a range from ∼18 to 23 days). The sample includes a handful of rare and peculiar SNe Ia. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of lessons learned from the ZTF sample that can eventually be applied to observations from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902...47M,[]
The Young and Nearby Normal Type Ia Supernova 2018gv: UV-optical Observations and the Earliest Spectropolarimetry,"The nondetection of companion stars in SN Ia progenitor systems lends support to the notion of double-degenerate systems and explosions triggered by the merging of two white dwarfs. This very asymmetric process should lead to a conspicuous polarimetric signature. By contrast, observations consistently find very low continuum polarization as the signatures from the explosion process largely dominate over the pre-explosion configuration within several days. Critical information about the interaction of the ejecta with a companion and any circumstellar matter is encoded in the early polarization spectra. In this study, we obtain spectropolarimetry of SN 2018gv with the ESO Very Large Telescope at -13.6 days relative to the B-band maximum light, or ∼5 days after the estimated explosion—the earliest spectropolarimetric observations to date of any SN Ia. These early observations still show a low continuum polarization (≲0.2%) and moderate line polarization (0.30% ± 0.04% for the prominent Si II λ6355 feature and 0.85% ± 0.04% for the high-velocity Ca component). The high degree of spherical symmetry implied by the low-line and continuum polarization at this early epoch is consistent with explosion models of delayed detonations and is inconsistent with the merger-induced explosion scenario. The dense UV and optical photometry and optical spectroscopy within the first ∼100 days after the maximum light indicate that SN 2018gv is a normal SN Ia with similar spectrophotometric behavior to SN 2011fe.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902...46Y,[]
SN 2018fif: The Explosion of a Large Red Supergiant Discovered in Its Infancy by the Zwicky Transient Facility,"High-cadence transient surveys are able to capture supernovae closer to their first light than ever before. Applying analytical models to such early emission, we can constrain the progenitor stars' properties. In this paper, we present observations of SN 2018fif (ZTF 18abokyfk). The supernova was discovered close to first light and monitored by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Early spectroscopic observations suggest that the progenitor of SN 2018fif was surrounded by relatively small amounts of circumstellar material compared to all previous cases. This particularity, coupled with the high-cadence multiple-band coverage, makes it a good candidate to investigate using shock-cooling models. We employ the SOPRANOS code, an implementation of the model by Sapir & Waxman and its extension to early times by Morag et al. Compared with previous implementations, SOPRANOS has the advantage of including a careful account of the limited temporal validity domain of the shock-cooling model as well as allowing usage of the entirety of the early UV data. We find that the progenitor of SN 2018fif was a large red supergiant with a radius of $R={744.0}_{-128.0}^{+183.0}\,{R}_{\odot }$ and an ejected mass of ${M}_{\mathrm{ej}}={9.3}_{-5.8}^{+0.4}\,{M}_{\odot }$ . Our model also gives information on the explosion epoch, the progenitor's inner structure, the shock velocity, and the extinction. The distribution of radii is double-peaked, with smaller radii corresponding to lower values of the extinction, earlier recombination times, and a better match to the early UV data. If these correlations persist in future objects, denser spectroscopic monitoring constraining the time of recombination, as well as accurate UV observations (e.g., with ULTRASAT), will help break the extinction/radius degeneracy and independently determine both.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...902....6S,[]
The Outburst of the Young Star Gaia19bey,"We report photometry and spectroscopy of the outburst of the young stellar object Gaia19bey. We have established the outburst light curve with archival Gaia ""G,"" ATLAS ""Orange,"" Zwicky Transient Facility r-band, and Pan-STARRS ""rizy""-filter photometry, showing an outburst of ~4 yr duration, longer than typical EX Lupi objects but shorter than FU Orionis objects. Its pre-outburst spectral energy distribution shows a flat far-infrared spectrum, confirming the early evolutionary state of Gaia19bey and its similarity to other deeply embedded young stars experiencing outbursts. A lower limit to the peak outburst luminosity is ~182 ${L}_{\odot }$ at an assumed distance of 1.4 kpc, the minimum plausible distance. Infrared and optical spectroscopy near maximum light show an emission line spectrum, including H I lines, strong red Ca II emission, other metal emission lines, infrared CO bandhead emission, and a strong infrared continuum. Toward the end of the outburst, the emission lines have all but disappeared and the spectrum has changed into an almost pure continuum spectrum. This indicates a cessation of magnetospheric accretion activity. The near-infrared colors have become redder as Gaia19bey has faded, indicating a cooling of the continuum component. Near the end of the outburst, the only remaining strong emission lines are forbidden shock-excited emission lines. Adaptive optics integral-field spectroscopy shows the H<SUB>2</SUB> 1-0 S(1) emission with the morphology of an outflow cavity and the extended emission in the [Fe II] line at 1644 nm with the morphology of an edge-on disk.

Constraining the transient high-energy activity of <ASTROBJ>FRB 180916.J0158+65</ASTROBJ> with Insight-HXMT follow-up observations,"Context. A link has finally been established between magnetars and fast radio burst (FRB) sources. Within this context, a major issue that remains unresolved pertains to whether sources of extragalactic FRBs exhibit X/γ-ray outbursts and whether this is correlated with radio activity. If so, the subsequent goal is to identify these sources.",,[]
Aims: We aim to constrain possible X/γ-ray burst activity from one of the nearest extragalactic FRB sources currently known. This is to be done over a broad energy range by looking for bursts over a range of timescales and energies that are compatible with those of powerful flares from extragalactic magnetars.,,,[]
"Methods: We followed up on the observation of the as-yet nearest extragalactic FRB source, located at a mere 149 Mpc distance, namely, the periodic repeater <ASTROBJ>FRB 180916.J0158+65</ASTROBJ>. This took place during the active phase between 4 and 7 February 2020, using the Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT). By taking advantage of the combination of broad-band wavelengths, a large effective area, and several independent detectors at our disposal, we searched for bursts over a set of timescales from 1 ms to 1.024 s with a sensitive algorithm that had been previously characterised and optimised. Moreover, through simulations, we studied the sensitivity of our technique in the released energy-duration phase space for a set of synthetic flares and assuming a range of different energy spectra.",,,[]
Results: We constrain the possible occurrence of flares in the 1-100 keV energy band to E < 10<SUP>46</SUP> erg for durations Δ t < 0.1 s over several tens of ks exposure.,,,[]
Conclusions: We can rule out the occurrence of giant flares similar to the ones that were observed in the few cases of Galactic magnetars.

The formation of neutron star systems through accretion-induced collapse in white-dwarf binaries,"The accretion-induced collapse (AIC) scenario was proposed 40 years ago as an evolutionary end state of oxygen-neon white dwarfs (ONe WDs), linking them to the formation of neutron star (NS) systems. However, there has been no direct detection of any AIC event so far, even though there exists a lot of indirect observational evidence. Meanwhile, the evolutionary pathways resulting in NS formation through AIC are still not thoroughly investigated. In this article, we review recent studies on the two classic progenitor models of AIC events, i.e., the single-degenerate model (including the ONe WD+MS/RG/He star channels and the CO WD+He star channel) and the double-degenerate model (including the double CO WD channel, the double ONe WD channel and the ONe WD+CO WD channel). Recent progress on these progenitor models is reviewed, including the evolutionary scenarios leading to AIC events, the initial parameter space for producing AIC events and the related objects (e.g., the pre-AIC systems and the post-AIC systems). For the single-degenerate model, the pre-AIC systems (i.e., the progenitor systems of AIC events) could potentially be identified as supersoft X-ray sources, symbiotics and cataclysmic variables (such as classical novae, recurrent novae, Ne novae and He novae) in the observations, whereas the post-AIC systems (i.e., NS systems) could potentially be identified as low-/intermediate-mass X-ray binaries, and the resulting low-/intermediate-mass binary pulsars, most notably millisecond pulsars. For the double-degenerate model, the pre-AIC systems are close double WDs with short orbital periods, whereas the post-AIC systems are single isolated NSs that may correspond to a specific kind of NS with peculiar properties. We also review the predicted rates of AIC events, the mass distribution of NSs produced via AIC and the gravitational wave (GW) signals from double WDs that are potential GW sources in the Galaxy in the context of future space-based GW detectors, such as LISA, TianQin, Taiji, etc. Recent theoretical and observational constraints on the detection of AIC events are summarized. In order to confirm the existence of the AIC process, and resolve this long-term issue presented by current stellar evolution theories, more numerical simulations and observational identifications are required.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020RAA....20..135W,[]

Science with the TianQin Observatory: Preliminary results on Galactic double white dwarf binaries,"We explore the prospects of detecting Galactic double white dwarf (DWD) binaries with the space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory TianQin. In this work, we analyze both a sample of currently known DWDs and a realistic synthetic population of DWDs to assess the number of guaranteed detections and the full capacity of the mission. We find that TianQin can detect 12 out of ∼100 known DWDs; GW signals of these binaries can be modeled in detail ahead of the mission launch, and therefore they can be used as verification sources. Besides, we estimate that TianQin has a potential to detect as many as 10<SUP>4</SUP> DWDs in the Milky Way. TianQin is expected to measure their orbital periods and amplitudes with accuracies of ∼10<SUP>-7</SUP> and ∼0.2 , respectively, and to localize on the sky a large fraction (39%) of the detected population to better than 1 deg<SUP>2</SUP> . We conclude that TianQin has the potential to significantly advance our knowledge on Galactic DWDs by increasing the sample up to 2 orders of magnitude, and will allow their multimessenger studies in combination with electromagnetic telescopes. We also test the possibilities of different configurations of TianQin: (1) the same mission with a different orientation, (2) two perpendicular constellations combined into a network, and (3) the combination of the network with the ESA-led Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. We find that the network of detectors boosts the accuracy on the measurement of source parameters by 1-2 orders of magnitude, with the improvement on sky localization being the most significant.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhRvD.102f3021H,[]
A Deep Search for Stable Venus Co-orbital Asteroids: Limits on the Population,"A stable population of objects co-orbiting with Venus was recently hypothesized in order to explain the existence of Venus's co-orbital dust ring. We conducted a five days twilight survey for these objects with the Cerro-Tololo Inter-American Observatory 4 m telescope covering about 35 unique square degrees to 21 mag in the r band. Our survey provides the most stringent limit so far on the number of Venus co-orbital asteroids; it was capable of detecting 5% of the entire population of those asteroids brighter than 21 mag. We estimate an upper limit on the number of co-orbital asteroids brighter than 21 mag (approximately 400-900 m in diameter depending on the asteroid albedo) to be $N={18}_{-14}^{+30}$ . Previous studies estimated the mass of the observed dust ring co-orbiting with Venus to be equivalent to an asteroid with a 2 km diameter ground to dust. Our survey estimates <6 asteroids larger than 2 km. This implies the following possibilities: that Venus co-orbitals are nonreflective at the observed phase angles, have a very low albedo (<1%), or that the Venus co-orbital dust ring has a source other than asteroids co-orbiting Venus. We discuss this result, and as an aid to future searches, we provide predictions for the spatial, visual magnitude, and number density distributions of stable Venus co-orbitals based on the dynamics of the region and magnitude estimates for various asteroid types.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PSJ.....1...47P,[]
On the amount of peculiar velocity field information in supernovae from LSST and beyond,"Peculiar velocities introduce correlations between supernova magnitudes, which implies that the supernova Hubble diagram residual carries information on both the matter power spectrum at the present time and its growth rate. By a combination of brute-force exact computations of likelihoods and Fisher matrix analysis, we investigate how this information, which comes from supernova data only, depends on different survey parameters such as covered area, depth, and duration. We show that, for a survey like The Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and a fixed redshift depth, the same observing time provides the same cosmological information whether one observes a larger area, or a smaller area during more years. We also show that although the peculiar velocity information is peaked in the range z ∈ [ 0 , 0 . 2 ] , there is yet plenty of information in z ∈ [ 0 . 2 , 0 . 5 ] , and for very high supernova number densities there is even more information in the latter range. We conclude that, after 5 years, LSST could measure σ<SUB>8</SUB> with an uncertainty of 0.17 with the current strategy, and that this could be improved to 0.09 if the supernova completeness is improved to 20%. Moreover, we forecast results considering the extra parameter γ, and show that this creates a non-linear degeneracy with σ<SUB>8</SUB> that makes the Fisher matrix analysis inadequate. Finally, we discuss the possibility of achieving competitive results with the current Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PDU....2900519G,[]

On the cosmological performance of photometrically classified supernovae with machine learning,"The efficient classification of different types of supernovae is one of the most important problems for observational cosmology. However, spectroscopic confirmation of most objects in upcoming photometric surveys, such as the the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, will be unfeasible. The development of automated classification processes based on photometry has thus become crucial. In this paper, we investigate the performance of machine learning (ML) classification on the final cosmological constraints using simulated light-curves from the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge, released in 2010. We study the use of different feature sets for the light-curves and many different ML pipelines based on either decision-tree ensembles or automated search processes. To construct the final catalogues we propose a threshold selection method, by employing a bias-variance tradeoff. This is a very robust and efficient way to minimize the mean squared error. With this method, we were able to obtain very strong cosmological constraints, which allowed us to keep $\sim 75{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the total information in the Type Ia supernovae when using the SALT2 feature set, and $\sim 33{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ for the other cases (based either on the Newling model or on standard wavelet decomposition).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.2974V,[]
Vetting the optical transient candidates detected by the GWAC network using convolutional neural networks,"The observation of the transient sky through a multitude of astrophysical messengers has led to several scientific breakthroughs in the last two decades, thanks to the fast evolution of the observational techniques and strategies employed by the astronomers. Now, it requires to be able to coordinate multiwavelength and multimessenger follow-up campaigns with instruments both in space and on ground jointly capable of scanning a large fraction of the sky with a high-imaging cadency and duty cycle. In the optical domain, the key challenge of the wide field-of-view telescopes covering tens to hundreds of square degrees is to deal with the detection, identification, and classification of hundreds to thousands of optical transient (OT) candidates every night in a reasonable amount of time. In the last decade, new automated tools based on machine learning approaches have been developed to perform those tasks with a low computing time and a high classification efficiency. In this paper, we present an efficient classification method using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to discard many common types of bogus falsely detected in astrophysical images in the optical domain. We designed this tool to improve the performances of the OT detection pipeline of the Ground Wide field Angle Cameras (GWAC) telescopes, a network of robotic telescopes aiming at monitoring the OT sky down to R = 16 with a 15 s imaging cadency. We applied our trained CNN classifier on a sample of 1472 GWAC OT candidates detected by the real-time detection pipeline.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.2641T,[]
Using machine learning for transient classification in searches for gravitational-wave counterparts,"The large sky localization regions offered by the gravitational-wave interferometers require efficient follow-up of the many counterpart candidates identified by the wide field-of-view telescopes. Given the restricted telescope time, the creation of prioritized lists of the many identified candidates becomes mandatory. Towards this end, we use astrorapid, a multiband photometric light-curve classifier, to differentiate between kilonovae, supernovae, and other possible transients. We demonstrate our method on the photometric observations of real events. In addition, the classification performance is tested on simulated light curves, both ideally and realistically sampled. We show that after only a few days of observations of an astronomical object, it is possible to rule out candidates as supernovae and other known transients.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.1320S,[]
Implications of the search for optical counterparts during the second part of the Advanced LIGO's and Advanced Virgo's third observing run: lessons learned for future follow-up observations,"Joint multimessenger observations with gravitational waves and electromagnetic (EM) data offer new insights into the astrophysical studies of compact objects. The third Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo observing run began on 2019 April 1; during the 11 months of observation, there have been 14 compact binary systems candidates for which at least one component is potentially a neutron star. Although intensive follow-up campaigns involving tens of ground and space-based observatories searched for counterparts, no EM counterpart has been detected. Following on a previous study of the first six months of the campaign, we present in this paper the next five months of the campaign from 2019 October to 2020 March. We highlight two neutron star-black hole candidates (S191205ah and S200105ae), two binary neutron star candidates (S191213g and S200213t), and a binary merger with a possible neutron star and a 'MassGap' component, S200115j. Assuming that the gravitational-wave (GW) candidates are of astrophysical origin and their location was covered by optical telescopes, we derive possible constraints on the matter ejected during the events based on the non-detection of counterparts. We find that the follow-up observations during the second half of the third observing run did not meet the necessary sensitivity to constrain the source properties of the potential GW candidate. Consequently, we suggest that different strategies have to be used to allow a better usage of the available telescope time.

While no viable electromagnetic (EM) counterpart candidate was identified, we estimate our 3D (volumetric) coverage using test light curves of on- and off-axis gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae. In cases where the source region was observable immediately, GOTO-4 was able to respond to a GW alert in less than a minute. The average time of first observation was 8.79 h after receiving an alert (9.90 h after trigger). A mean of 732.3 square degrees were tiled per event, representing on average 45.3 per cent of the LVC probability map, or 70.3 per cent of the observable probability. This coverage will further improve as the facility scales up alongside the localization performance of the evolving GW detector network. Even in its 4-telescope prototype configuration, GOTO is capable of detecting AT2017gfo-like kilonovae beyond 200 Mpc in favourable observing conditions. We cannot currently place meaningful EM limits on the population of distant ( $\hat{D}_L = 1.3$ Gpc) binary black hole mergers because our test models are too faint to recover at this distance. However, as GOTO is upgraded towards its full 32-telescope, 2 node (La Palma & Australia) configuration, it is expected to be sufficiently sensitive to cover the predicted O4 binary neutron star merger volume, and will be able to respond to both northern and southern triggers.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497..726G,[]
SN 2018hti: a nearby superluminous supernova discovered in a metal-poor galaxy,"SN 2018hti is a Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN I) with an absolute g-band magnitude of -22.2 at maximum brightness, discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System in a metal-poor galaxy at a redshift of 0.0612. We present extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of this supernova, covering the phases from ∼-35 d to more than +340 d from the r-band maximum. Combining our BVgri-band photometry with Swift UVOT optical/ultraviolet photometry, we calculated the peak luminosity as ∼3.5 × 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Modelling the observed light curve reveals that the luminosity evolution of SN 2018hti can be produced by an ejecta mass of 5.8 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a magnetar with a magnetic field of B = 1.8 × 10<SUP>13</SUP> G having an initial spin period of P<SUB>0</SUB> = 1.8 ms. Based on such a magnetar-powered scenario and a larger sample, a correlation between the spin of the magnetar and the kinetic energy of the ejecta can be inferred for most SLSNe I, suggesting a self-consistent scenario. Like for other SLSNe I, the host galaxy of SN 2018hti is found to be relatively faint (M<SUB>g</SUB> = -17.75 mag) and of low metallicity (Z = 0.3 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>), with a star formation rate of 0.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. According to simulation results of single-star evolution, SN 2018hti could originate from a massive, metal-poor star with a zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass of 25-40 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, or from a less massive rotating star with M<SUB>ZAMS</SUB> ≈ 16-25 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. For the case of a binary system, its progenitor could also be a star with $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} rsim 25\, \mathrm{ M}_\odot$ .",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497..318L,[]
AT2018kzr: the merger of an oxygen-neon white dwarf and a neutron star or black hole,"We present detailed spectroscopic analysis of the extraordinarily fast-evolving transient AT2018kzr. The transient's observed light curve showed a rapid decline rate, comparable to the kilonova AT2017gfo. We calculate a self-consistent sequence of radiative transfer models (using TARDIS) and determine that the ejecta material is dominated by intermediate-mass elements (O, Mg, and Si), with a photospheric velocity of ~12 000-14 500 $\rm {km}\, s^{-1}$. The early spectra have the unusual combination of being blue but dominated by strong Fe II and Fe III absorption features. We show that this combination is only possible with a high Fe content (3.5 per cent). This implies a high Fe/(Ni+Co) ratio. Given the short time from the transient's proposed explosion epoch, the Fe cannot be <SUP>56</SUP>Fe resulting from the decay of radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni synthesized in the explosion. Instead, we propose that this is stable <SUP>54</SUP>Fe, and that the transient is unusually rich in this isotope. We further identify an additional, high-velocity component of ejecta material at ~20 000-26 000 $\rm {km}\, s^{-1}$, which is mildly asymmetric and detectable through the Ca II near-infrared triplet. We discuss our findings with reference to a range of plausible progenitor systems and compare with published theoretical work. We conclude that AT2018kzr is most likely the result of a merger between an ONe white dwarf and a neutron star or black hole. As such, it would be the second plausible candidate with a good spectral sequence for the electromagnetic counterpart of a compact binary merger, after AT2017gfo.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497..246G,[]
Comprehensive Analysis of the Tidal Effect in Gravitational Waves and Implication for Cosmology,"Detection of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by coalescence of compact binaries provides a novel way to measure the luminosity distance of GW events. Combining their redshift, they can act as standard sirens to constrain cosmological parameters. For various GW detector networks in second-generation (2G), 2.5G, and 3G, we comprehensively analyze the method to constrain the equation-of-state (EOS) of binary neutron stars (BNSs) and extract their redshifts through the imprints of tidal effects in GW waveforms. We find for these events that the observations of electromagnetic counterparts in the low-redshift range z < 0.1 are important for constraining the tidal effects. Considering 17 different EOSs of NSs or quark stars, we find GW observations have strong capability to determine the EOS. Applying the events as standard sirens, and considering the constraints of NS's EOS derived from low-redshift observations as prior, we can constrain the dark energy EOS parameters w<SUB>0</SUB> and w<SUB>a</SUB>. In the 3G era, the potential constraints are Δw<SUB>0</SUB> ∈ (0.0006,0.004) and Δw<SUB>a</SUB> ∈ (0.004,0.02), which are 1-3 orders smaller than those from traditional methods, including Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and baryon acoustic oscillations. The constraints are also made 1 order smaller than the method of GW standard siren by fixing the redshifts through short-hard γ-ray bursts, due to more available GW events in this method. Therefore, GW standard sirens, based on the tidal effect measurement, provide a realizable and much more powerful tool in cosmology.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJS..250....6W,[]
Four (Super)luminous Supernovae from the First Months of the ZTF Survey,"We present photometry and spectroscopy of four hydrogen-poor luminous supernovae discovered during the 2-month long science commissioning and early operations of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey. Three of these objects, SN 2018bym (ZTF18aapgrxo), SN 2018avk (ZTF18aaisyyp), and SN 2018bgv (ZTF18aavrmcg), resemble typical SLSN-I spectroscopically, while SN 2018don (ZTF18aajqcue) may be an object similar to SN 2007bi experiencing considerable host galaxy reddening, or an intrinsically long-lived, luminous, and red SN Ic. We analyze the light curves, spectra, and host galaxy properties of these four objects and put them in context of the population of SLSN-I. SN 2018bgv stands out as the fastest-rising SLSN-I observed to date, with a rest-frame g-band rise time of just 10 days from explosion to peak—if it is powered by magnetar spin-down, the implied ejecta mass is only ≃1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. SN 2018don also displays unusual properties—in addition to its red colors and comparatively massive host galaxy, the light curve undergoes some of the strongest light-curve undulations postpeak seen in an SLSN-I, which we speculate may be due to interaction with circumstellar material. We discuss the promises and challenges of finding SLSNe in large-scale surveys like ZTF given the observed diversity in the population.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...901...61L,[]
Characterization of Temporarily Captured Minimoon 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB> by Keck Time-resolved Spectrophotometry,"We present time-resolved visible spectrophotometry of 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB>, the second known minimoon. The spectrophotometry was taken with the Keck I/Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer between wavelengths 434 and 912 nm in the B, g, V, R, I, and RG850 filters as it was leaving the Earth-Moon system on 2020 March 23 UTC. The spectrum of 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB> resembles V-type asteroids and some lunar rock samples with a 434-761 nm reddish slope of ∼18%/100 nm (g-r = 0.62 ± 0.08 and r-i = 0.21 ± 0.06) with an absorption band at ∼900 nm corresponding to i-z = -0.54 ± 0.10. Combining our measured H of 31.9 ± 0.1 with an albedo of 0.35 typical for V-type asteroids, we determine 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB>'s diameter to be ∼0.9 ± 0.1 m, making it the first minimoon and one of the smallest asteroids to be spectrally studied. We use our time-series photometry to detect significant periodic light-curve variations with a period of ∼573 s and amplitude of ∼1. In addition, we extend the observational arc of 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB> to 37 days, to 2020 March 23 UTC. From the improved orbital solution for 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB>, we estimate the likely duration of its capture to be ∼2 yr and the nongravitational perturbation on its orbit due to radiation pressure with an area-to-mass ratio of (6.9 ± 2.4) × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> kg<SUP>-1</SUP> implying a density of 2.3 ± 0.8 g cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, broadly compatible with other meter-scale asteroids and lunar rock.

A Year-long Superoutburst from an Ultracompact White Dwarf Binary Reveals the Importance of Donor Star Irradiation,"SDSS J080710+485259 is the longest-period outbursting ultracompact white dwarf binary. Its first-ever detected superoutburst started in 2018 November and lasted for a year, the longest detected so far for any short orbital period accreting white dwarf. Here we show the superoutburst duration of SDSS J080710+485259 exceeds the ∼2 month viscous time of its accretion disk by a factor of about 5. Consequently it follows that neither the empirical relation nor the theoretical relation between the orbital period and the superoutburst duration for AM CVn systems. Six months after the end of the superoutburst the binary remained 0.4 mag brighter than its quiescent level before the superoutburst. We detect a variable X-ray behavior during the post-outburst cooling phase, demonstrating changes in the mass accretion rate. We discuss how irradiation of the donor star, a scenario poorly explored so far and that ultimately can have important consequences for AM CVns as gravitational-wave sources, might explain the unusual observed features of the superoutburst.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...900L..37R,[]
Strong Calcium Emission Indicates that the Ultraviolet-flashing SN Ia 2019yvq Was the Result of a Sub-Chandrasekar-mass Double-detonation Explosion,"We present nebular spectra of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2019yvq, which had a bright flash of blue and ultraviolet light after exploding, followed by a rise similar to other SNe Ia. Although SN 2019yvq displayed several other rare characteristics, such as persistent high ejecta velocity near peak brightness, it was not especially peculiar, and if the early ""excess"" emission were not observed, it would likely be included in cosmological samples. The excess flux can be explained by several different physical models linked to the details of the progenitor system and explosion mechanism. Each has unique predictions for the optically thin emission at late times. In our nebular spectra, we detect strong [Ca II] λλ7291, 7324 and Ca near-IR triplet emission, consistent with a double-detonation explosion. We do not detect H, He, or [O I] emission, predictions for some single-degenerate progenitor systems and violent white dwarf mergers. The amount of swept-up H or He is <2.8 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> and 2.4 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, respectively. Aside from strong Ca emission, the SN 2019yvq nebular spectrum is similar to those of typical SNe Ia with the same light-curve shape. Comparing to double-detonation models, we find that the Ca emission is consistent with a model with a total progenitor mass of 1.15 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. However, we note that a lower progenitor mass better explains the early light-curve and peak luminosity. The unique properties of SN 2019yvq suggest that thick He-shell double detonations only account for ${1.1}_{-1.1}^{+2.1} \% $ of the total ""normal"" SN Ia rate. The SN 2019yvq is one of the best examples yet that multiple progenitor channels appear necessary to reproduce the full diversity of ""normal"" SNe Ia.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...900L..27S,[]
Comparative Spectral Analysis of the Superluminous Supernova 2019neq,"We present a spectroscopic analysis of the recently discovered fast-evolving Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) SN 2019neq (at redshift z = 0.1059). We compare it to the well-studied slowly evolving SLSN-I SN 2010kd (z = 0.101). Our main goal is to search for spectroscopic differences between the two groups of SLSNe-I. Differences in the spectra may reveal different ejecta compositions and explosion mechanisms. Our investigation concentrates on optical spectra observed with the 10 m Hobby-Eberly Telescope Low Resolution Spectrograph-2 at McDonald Observatory during the photospheric phase. We apply the SYN++ code to model the spectra of SN 2019neq taken at -4 days, +5 days, and +29 days from maximum light. We examine the chemical evolution and ejecta composition of the SLSN by identifying the elements and ionization states in its spectra. We find that a spectral model consisting of O III, Co III, and Si IV gives a SYN++ fit that is comparable to the typical SLSN-I spectral model consisting of O II, and conclude that the true identification of those lines, at least in the case of SN 2019neq, is ambiguous. Based on modeling the entire optical spectrum, we classify SN 2019neq as a fast-evolving SLSN-I having a photospheric velocity gradient of $\dot{v}\sim 375$ km s<SUP>-1</SUP> day<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is among the highest velocity gradients observed for an SLSN-I. Inferring the velocity gradient from the proposed Fe II λ5169 feature alone would result in $\dot{v}\sim 100$ km s<SUP>-1</SUP> day<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is still within the observed range of fast-evolving SLSNe-I. In addition, we derive the number density of relevant ionization states for a variety of identified elements at the epoch of the three observations. Finally, we give constraints on the lower limit of the ejecta mass and find that both SLSNe have an ejecta mass at least one order of magnitude higher than normal SNe Ia, while the fast-evolving SN 2019neq has an ejecta mass a factor of two lower than the slowly evolving SN 2010kd. These mass estimates suggest the existence of a possible correlation between the evolution timescale and the ejected mass of SLSNe-I.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...900...73K,[]
Dust Reverberation Mapping in Distant Quasars from Optical and Mid-infrared Imaging Surveys,"The size of the dust torus in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and their high-luminosity counterparts, quasars, can be inferred from the time delay between UV/optical accretion disk continuum variability and the response in the mid-infrared (MIR) torus emission. This dust reverberation mapping (RM) technique has been successfully applied to ∼70 z ≲ 0.3 AGNs and quasars. Here we present first results of our dust RM program for distant quasars covered in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 region combining ∼20 yr ground-based optical light curves with 10 yr MIR light curves from the WISE satellite. We measure a high-fidelity lag between W1 band (3.4 μm) and g band for 587 quasars over 0.3 ≲ z ≲ 2 ( $\left\langle z\right\rangle \sim 0.8$ ) and two orders of magnitude in quasar luminosity. They tightly follow (intrinsic scatter ∼0.17 dex in lag) the IR lag-luminosity relation observed for z < 0.3 AGNs, revealing a remarkable size-luminosity relation for the dust torus over more than four decades in AGN luminosity, with little dependence on additional quasar properties such as Eddington ratio and variability amplitude. This study motivates further investigations in the utility of dust RM for cosmology and strongly endorses a compelling science case for the combined 10 yr Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (optical) and 5 yr Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope 2 μm light curves in a deep survey for low-redshift AGN dust RM with much lower luminosities and shorter, measurable IR lags.

SN2019dge: A Helium-rich Ultra-stripped Envelope Supernova,"We present observations of ZTF18abfcmjw (SN2019dge), a helium-rich supernova with a fast-evolving light curve indicating an extremely low ejecta mass (≈0.33 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) and low kinetic energy (≈1.3 × 10<SUP>50</SUP> erg). Early-time (<4 days after explosion) photometry reveals evidence of shock cooling from an extended helium-rich envelope of ∼0.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> located ∼1.2 × 10<SUP>13</SUP> cm from the progenitor. Early-time He II line emission and subsequent spectra show signatures of interaction with helium-rich circumstellar material, which extends from ≳5 × 10<SUP>13</SUP> cm to ≳2 × 10<SUP>16</SUP> cm. We interpret SN2019dge as a helium-rich supernova from an ultra-stripped progenitor, which originates from a close binary system consisting of a mass-losing helium star and a low-mass main-sequence star or a compact object (i.e., a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole). We infer that the local volumetric birth rate of 19dge-like ultra-stripped SNe is in the range of 1400-8200 $\,{\mathrm{Gpc}}^{-3}\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$ (i.e., 2%-12% of core-collapse supernova rate). This can be compared to the observed coalescence rate of compact neutron star binaries that are not formed by dynamical capture.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...900...46Y,[]
On a century of extragalactic novae and the rise of the rapid recurrent novae,"Novae are the observable outcome of a transient thermonuclear runaway on the surface of an accreting white dwarf in a close binary system. Their high peak luminosity renders them visible in galaxies out beyond the distance of the Virgo Cluster. Over the past century, surveys of extragalactic novae, particularly within the nearby Andromeda Galaxy, have yielded substantial insights regarding the properties of their populations and sub-populations. The recent decade has seen the first detailed panchromatic studies of individual extragalactic novae and the discovery of two probably related sub-groups: the 'faint-fast' and the 'rapid recurrent' novae. In this review we summarise the past 100 years of extragalactic efforts, introduce the rapid recurrent sub-group, and look in detail at the remarkable faint-fast, and rapid recurrent, nova M31N 2008-12a. We end with a brief look forward, not to the next 100 years, but the next few decades, and the study of novae in the upcoming era of wide-field and multi-messenger time-domain surveys.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AdSpR..66.1147D,[]
Insights from multi-wavelength observations during high and low states of non-magnetic CVs,"Close binaries containing a white dwarf accreting from a disk that receives material from a late stellar companion show an interesting variety of behaviors that depend on their accretion rates and the changes in this rate. The highest accretion rates are evident during the bright states of novalikes, as well as the superoutbursts of the shortest period dwarf novae followed by normal outbursts and the Z Cam systems. While the normal outbursts and superoutbursts of dwarf novae can be understood from the standpoint of disk and tidal instabilities, the changes in rates in novalikes when they enter low brightness states and the cause of extremely high rates for the systems with orbital periods between 3 and 4 h remain elusive. This paper highlights some recent insights and continuing problems found from X-ray, UV and optical observations of these high and low states, as well as the prospects for increased understanding from the anticipated future ground and space missions.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AdSpR..66.1090S,[]
Identifying Microlensing Events Using Neural Networks,"Current gravitational microlensing surveys are observing hundreds of millions of stars in the Galactic bulge - which makes finding rare microlensing events a challenging tasks. In almost all previous works, microlensing events have been detected either by applying very strict selection cuts or manually inspecting tens of thousands of light curves. However, the number of microlensing events expected in the future space-based microlensing experiments forces us to consider fully-automated approaches. They are especially important for selecting binary-lens events that often exhibit complex light curve morphologies and are otherwise difficult to find. There are no dedicated selection algorithms for binary-lens events in the literature, which hampers their statistical studies. Here, we present two simple neural-network-based classifiers for detecting single and binary microlensing events. We demonstrate their robustness using OGLE-III and OGLE-IV data sets and show they perform well on microlensing events detected in data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Classifiers are able to correctly recognize ≈98% of single-lens events and 80-85% of binary-lens events.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AcA....70..169M,[]
A Warm Jupiter Transiting an M Dwarf: A TESS Single-transit Event Confirmed with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder,"We confirm the planetary nature of a warm Jupiter transiting the early M dwarf TOI-1899 using a combination of available TESS photometry; high-precision, near-infrared spectroscopy with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder; and speckle and adaptive optics imaging. The data reveal a transiting companion on an ∼29 day orbit with a mass and radius of $0.66\pm 0.07\ {M}_{{\rm{J}}}$ and ${1.15}_{-0.05}^{+0.04}\ {R}_{{\rm{J}}}$ , respectively. The star, TOI-1899, is the lowest-mass star known to host a transiting warm Jupiter, and we discuss the follow-up opportunities afforded by a warm ( ${T}_{\mathrm{eq}}\sim 362$ K) gas giant orbiting an M0 star. Our observations reveal that TOI-1899.01 is a puffy warm Jupiter, and we suggest additional transit observations to both refine the orbit and constrain the true dilution observed in TESS.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160..147C,[]
Design and Operation of the ATLAS Transient Science Server,"The Asteroid Terrestrial impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) system consists of two 0.5 m Schmidt telescopes with cameras covering 29 square degrees at plate scale of 1.86 arcsec per pixel. Working in tandem, the telescopes routinely survey the whole sky visible from Hawaii (above $\delta  -50^\circ $ ) every two nights, exposing four times per night, typically reaching $o 19$ magnitude per exposure when the moon is illuminated and $c 19.5$ magnitude per exposure in dark skies. Construction is underway of two further units to be sited in Chile and South Africa which will result in an all-sky daily cadence from 2021. Initially designed for detecting potentially hazardous near earth objects, the ATLAS data enable a range of astrophysical time domain science. To extract transients from the data stream requires a computing system to process the data, assimilate detections in time and space and associate them with known astrophysical sources. Here we describe the hardware and software infrastructure to produce a stream of clean, real, astrophysical transients in real time. This involves machine learning and boosted decision tree algorithms to identify extragalactic and Galactic transients. Typically we detect 10-15 supernova candidates per night which we immediately announce publicly. The ATLAS discoveries not only enable rapid follow-up of interesting sources but will provide complete statistical samples within the local volume of 100 Mpc. A simple comparison of the detected supernova rate within 100 Mpc, with no corrections for completeness, is already significantly higher (factor 1.5 to 2) than the current accepted rates.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132h5002S,[]
A numerical light curve model for interaction-powered supernovae,"We construct a numerical light curve model for interaction-powered supernovae that arise from an interaction between the ejecta and the circumstellar matter (CSM). In order to resolve the shocked region of an interaction-powered supernova, we solve the fluid equations and radiative transfer equation assuming steady states in the rest frames of the reverse and forward shocks at each time step. Then we numerically solve the radiative transfer equation and the energy equation in the CSM with the radiative flux obtained from the forward shock as a radiation source. We also compare the results of our models with observational data of two supernovae, 2005kj and 2005ip, classified as type IIn, and discuss the validity of our assumptions. We conclude that our model can predict the physical parameters associated with supernova ejecta and the CSM from the observed features of the light curve as long as the CSM is sufficiently dense. Furthermore, we found that the absorption of radiation in the CSM is an important factor in calculating the luminosity.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASJ...72...67T,[]

"Progenitor, precursor, and evolution of the dusty remnant of the stellar merger M31-LRN-2015","M31-LRN-2015 is a likely stellar merger discovered in the Andromeda Galaxy in 2015. We present new optical to mid-infrared photometry and optical spectroscopy for this event. Archival data show that the source started to brighten ~2 yr before the nova event. During this precursor phase, the source brightened by ~3 mag. The light curve at 6 and 1.5 months before the main outburst may show periodicity, with periods of 16 ± 0.3 and 28.1 ± 1.4 d, respectively. This complex emission may be explained by runaway mass-loss from the system after the binary undergoes Roche lobe overflow, leading the system to coalesce in tens of orbital periods. While the progenitor spectral energy distribution shows no evidence of pre-existing warm dust in the system, the remnant forms an optically thick dust shell at approximately four months after the outburst peak. The optical depth of the shell increases dramatically after 1.5 yr, suggesting the existence of shocks that enhance the dust formation process. We propose that the merger remnant is likely an inflated giant obscured by a cooling shell of gas with mass ~0.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> ejected at the onset of the common envelope phase.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.5503B,[]
Non-linear dynamical tides in white dwarf binaries,"Compact white dwarf (WD) binaries are important sources for space-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories, and an increasing number of them are being identified by surveys like Extremely Low Mass (ELM) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We study the effects of non-linear dynamical tides in such binaries. We focus on the global three-mode parametric instability and show that it has a much lower threshold energy than the local wave-breaking condition studied previously. By integrating networks of coupled modes, we calculate the tidal dissipation rate as a function of orbital period. We construct phenomenological models that match these numerical results and use them to evaluate the spin and luminosity evolution of a WD binary. While in linear theory the WD's spin frequency can lock to the orbital frequency, we find that such a lock cannot be maintained when non-linear effects are taken into account. Instead, as the orbit decays, the spin and orbit go in and out of synchronization. Each time they go out of synchronization, there is a brief but significant dip in the tidal heating rate. While most WDs in compact binaries should have luminosities that are similar to previous traveling-wave estimates, a few per cent should be about 10 times dimmer because they reside in heating rate dips. This offers a potential explanation for the low luminosity of the CO WD in J0651. Lastly, we consider the impact of tides on the GW signal and show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and TianGO can constrain the WD's moment of inertia to better than $1{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ for centi-Hz systems.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.5482Y,[]
The dust never settles: collisional production of gas and dust in evolved planetary systems,"Multi-epoch infrared photometry from Spitzer is used to monitor circumstellar discs at white dwarfs, which are consistent with disrupted minor planets whose debris is accreted and chemically reflected by their host stars. Widespread infrared variability is found across the population of 37 stars with two or more epochs. Larger flux changes occur on longer time-scales, reaching several tens of per cent over baselines of a few years. The canonical model of a geometrically thin, optically thick disc is thus insufficient, as it cannot give rise to the observed behaviour. Optically thin dust best accounts for the variability, where collisions drive dust production and destruction. Notably, the highest infrared variations are seen in systems that show Ca II emission, supporting planetesimal collisions for all known debris discs, with the most energetic occurring in those with detected gaseous debris. The sample includes the only polluted white dwarf with a circumbinary disc, where the signal of the day-night cycle of its irradiated substellar companion appears diluted by dust emission.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.5233S,[]
"Physical characterization of 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB>, the first known asteroid orbiting inside Venus orbit","The first known asteroid with the orbit inside that of Venus is 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB>. This may be the largest member of a new population of small bodies with the aphelion smaller than 0.718 au, called Vatiras. The surface of 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB> is being constantly modified by the high temperature, by the strong solar wind irradiation that characterizes the innermost region of the Solar system, and by high-energy micrometeorite impacts. The study of its physical properties represents an extreme test-case for the science of near-Earth asteroids. Here, we report spectroscopic observations of 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB> in the 0.5-1.5-μm wavelength interval. These were performed with the Nordic Optical Telescope and the William Herschel Telescope. Based on the obtained spectra, we classify 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB> as a Sa-type asteroid. We estimate the diameter of this Vatira to be $1.50_{-0.65}^{+1.10}$ km by considering the average albedo of A-type and S-complex asteroids ( $p_V=0.23_{-0.08}^{+0.11}$ ), and the absolute magnitude (H = 16.40 ± 0.78 mag). The wide spectral band around 1 μm shows the signature of an olivine-rich composition. The estimated band centre BIC = 1.08 ± 0.02 μm corresponds to a ferroan olivine mineralogy similar to that of brachinite meteorites.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.3572P,[]
The lifetimes of planetary debris discs around white dwarfs,"The lifetime of a planetary disc that orbits a white dwarf represents a crucial input parameter into evolutionary models of that system. Here we apply a purely analytical formalism to estimate lifetimes of the debris phase of these discs, before they are ground down into dust or are subject to sublimation from the white dwarf. We compute maximum lifetimes for three different types of white dwarf discs, formed from (I) radiative YORP break-up of exo-asteroids along the giant branch phases at 2-100 au, (II) radiation-less spin-up disruption of these minor planets at ${\sim} 1.5\!-\!4.5\, \mathrm{R}_{\odot }$ , and (III) tidal disruption of minor or major planets within about $1.3\, \mathrm{R}_{\odot }$ . We display these maximum lifetimes as a function of disc mass and extent, constituent planetesimal properties, and representative orbital excitations of eccentricity and inclination. We find that YORP discs with masses of up to 10<SUP>24</SUP> kg live long enough to provide a reservoir of surviving cm-sized pebbles and m- to km-sized boulders that can be perturbed intact to white dwarfs with cooling ages of up to 10 Gyr. Debris discs formed from the spin or tidal disruption of these minor planets or major planets can survive in a steady state for up to, respectively, 1 or 0.01 Myr, although most tidal discs would leave a steady state within about 1 yr. Our results illustrate that dust-less planetesimal transit detections are plausible, and would provide particularly robust evolutionary constraints. Our formalism can easily be adapted to individual systems and future discoveries.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.2292V,[]
The possible disappearance of a massive star in the low-metallicity galaxy PHL 293B,"We investigate a suspected very massive star in one of the most metal-poor dwarf galaxies, PHL 293B. Excitingly, we find the sudden disappearance of the stellar signatures from our 2019 spectra, in particular the broad H lines with P Cygni profiles that have been associated with a massive luminous blue variable (LBV) star. Such features are absent from our spectra obtained in 2019 with the Echelle Spectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet- and Stable Spectroscopic Observation and X-shooter instruments of the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope. We compute radiative transfer models using CMFGEN, which fit the observed spectrum of the LBV and are consistent with ground-based and archival Hubble Space Telescope photometry. Our models show that during 2001-2011, the LBV had a luminosity L<SUB>*</SUB> = 2.5-3.5 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> L<SUB>⊙</SUB>, a mass-loss rate $\dot{M} = 0.005{-}0.020 ~{\rm M}_{\odot }$ yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, a wind velocity of 1000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, and effective and stellar temperatures of T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 6000-6800 and T<SUB>*</SUB> = 9500-15 000 K. These stellar properties indicate an eruptive state. We consider two main hypotheses for the absence of the broad emission components from the spectra obtained since 2011. One possibility is that we are seeing the end of an LBV eruption of a surviving star, with a mild drop in luminosity, a shift to hotter effective temperatures, and some dust obscuration. Alternatively, the LBV could have collapsed to a massive black hole without the production of a bright supernova.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.1902A,[]
The VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea infrared variability catalogue (VIVA-I),"High extinction and crowding create a natural limitation for optical surveys towards the central regions of the Milky Way, where the gas and dust are mainly confined. Large-scale near-infrared (IR) surveys of the Galactic plane and bulge are a good opportunity to explore open scientific questions as well as to test our capability to explore future data sets efficiently. Thanks to the VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea (VVV) ESO public survey, it is now possible to explore a large number of objects in those regions. This paper addresses the variability analysis of all VVV point sources having more than 10 observations in VVVDR4 using a novel approach. In total, the near-IR light curves of 288 378 769 sources were analysed using methods developed in the New Insight Into Time Series Analysis project. As a result, we present a complete sample having 44 998 752 variable star candidates (VVV-CVSC), which include accurate individual coordinates, near-IR magnitudes (Z,Y,J, and H<SUB>s</SUB>), extinctions A(K<SUB>s</SUB>), variability indices, periods, amplitudes, among other parameters to assess the science. Unfortunately, a side effect of having a highly complete sample, is also having a high level of contamination by non-variable (contamination ratio of non-variables to variables is slightly over 10:1). To deal with this, we also provide some flags and parameters that can be used by the community to decrease the number of variable candidates without heavily decreasing the completeness of the sample. In particular, we cross-identified 339 601 of our sources with Simbad and AAVSO data bases, which provide us with information for these objects at other wavelengths. This subsample constitutes a unique resource to study the corresponding near-IR variability of known sources as well as to assess the IR variability related with X-ray and gamma-ray sources. On the other hand, the other ${\sim }99.5{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ sources in our sample constitutes a number of potentially new objects with variability information for the heavily crowded and reddened regions of the Galactic plane and bulge. The present results also provide an important queryable resource to perform variability analysis and to characterize ongoing and future surveys like TESS and LSST.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.1730F,[]
Progenitors of early-time interacting supernovae,"We compute an extensive set of early-time spectra of supernovae interacting with circumstellar material using the radiative transfer code CMFGEN. Our models are applicable to events observed from 1 to a few days after explosion. Using these models, we constrain the progenitor and explosion properties of a sample of 17 observed interacting supernovae at early times. Because massive stars have strong mass-loss, these spectra provide valuable information about supernova progenitors, such as mass-loss rates, wind velocities, and surface abundances. We show that these events span a wide range of explosion and progenitor properties, exhibiting supernova luminosities in the 10<SUP>8</SUP> to 10<SUP>12</SUP> L<SUB>⊙</SUB> range, temperatures from 10 000 to 60 000 K, progenitor mass-loss rates from a few 10<SUP>-4</SUP> up to 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, wind velocities from 100 to 800 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, and surface abundances from solar-like to H-depleted. Our results suggest that many progenitors of supernovae interacting with circumstellar material have significantly increased mass-loss before explosion compared to what massive stars show during the rest of their lifetimes. We also infer a lack of correlation between surface abundances and mass-loss rates. This may point to the pre-explosion mass-loss mechanism being independent of stellar mass. We find that the majority of these events have CNO-processed surface abundances. In the single star scenario this points to a preference towards high-mass RSGs as progenitors of interacting SNe, while binary evolution could impact this conclusion. Our models are publicly available and readily applicable to analyse results from ongoing and future large-scale surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Factory.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.1325B,[]
Spectroscopic and photometric periods of six ultracompact accreting binaries,"Ultracompact accreting binary systems each consist of a stellar remnant accreting helium-enriched material from a compact donor star. Such binaries include two related sub-classes, AM CVn-type binaries and helium cataclysmic variables, in both of which the central star is a white dwarf. We present a spectroscopic and photometric study of six accreting binaries with orbital periods in the range of 40-70 min, including phase-resolved VLT spectroscopy and high-speed ULTRACAM photometry. Four of these are AM CVn systems and two are helium cataclysmic variables. For four of these binaries we are able to identify orbital periods (of which three are spectroscopic). SDSS J1505+0659 has an orbital period of 67.8 min, significantly longer than previously believed, and longer than any other known AM CVn binary. We identify a Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) infrared excess in SDSS J1505+0659 that we believe to be the first direct detection of an AM CVn donor star in a non-direct impacting binary. The mass ratio of SDSS J1505+0659 is consistent with a white dwarf donor. CRTS J1028-0819 has an orbital period of 52.1 min, the shortest period of any helium cataclysmic variable. MOA 2010-BLG-087 is co-aligned with a K-class star that dominates its spectrum. ASASSN-14ei and ASASSN-14mv both show a remarkable number of echo outbursts following superoutbursts (13 and 10 echo outbursts respectively). ASASSN-14ei shows an increased outburst rate over the years following its superoutburst, perhaps resulting from an increased accretion rate.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.1243G,[]
Observations of the low-luminosity Type Iax supernova 2019gsc: a fainter clone of SN 2008ha?,"We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the faint-and-fast evolving Type Iax supernova (SN) 2019gsc, extending from the time of g-band maximum until about 50 d post-maximum, when the object faded to an apparent r-band magnitude m<SUB>r</SUB> = 22.48 ± 0.11 mag. SN 2019gsc reached a peak luminosity of only M<SUB>g</SUB> = -13.58 ± 0.15 mag, and is characterized with a post-maximum decline rate Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(g) = 1.08 ± 0.14 mag. These light curve parameters are comparable to those measured for SN 2008ha of M<SUB>g</SUB> = -13.89 ± 0.14 mag at peak and Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(g) =1.80 ± 0.03 mag. The spectral features of SN 2019gsc also resemble those of SN 2008ha at similar phases. This includes both the extremely low ejecta velocity at maximum, ∼3000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, and at late-time (phase +54 d) strong forbidden iron and cobalt lines as well as both forbidden and permitted calcium features. Furthermore, akin to SN 2008ha, the bolometric light curve of SN 2019gsc is consistent with the production of ≈0.003 ± 0.001 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni. The explosion parameters, M<SUB>ej</SUB> ≈ 0.13 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and E<SUB>k</SUB> ≈ 12 × 10<SUP>48</SUP> erg, are also similar to those inferred for SN 2008ha. We estimate a subsolar oxygen abundance for the host galaxy of SN 2019gsc (12 + log<SUB>10</SUB>(O/H) =8.10 ± 0.18 dex), consistent with the equally metal-poor environment of SN 2008ha. Altogether, our data set for SN 2019gsc indicates that this is a member of a small but growing group of extreme SN Iax that includes SN 2008ha and SN 2010ae.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.1132T,[]
Confirmation of monoperiodicity above 20 s for two blue large-amplitude pulsators,"Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) are a new class of pulsating variable stars. They are located close to the hot subdwarf branch in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and have spectral classes of late O or early B. Stellar evolution models indicate that these stars are likely radially pulsating, driven by iron group opacity in their interiors. A number of variable stars with a similar driving mechanism exist near the hot subdwarf branch with multiperiodic oscillations caused by either pressure (p) or gravity (g) modes. No multiperiodic signals were detected in the OGLE (Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment) discovery light curves since it would be difficult to detect short-period signals associated with higher order p modes with the OGLE cadence. Using the RISE instrument on the Liverpool Telescope, we produced high-cadence light curves of two BLAPs, OGLE-BLAP-009 (m<SUB>V</SUB> = 15.65 mag) and OGLE-BLAP-014 (m<SUB>V</SUB> = 16.79 mag), using a 720 nm longpass filter. Frequency analysis of these light curves identifies a primary oscillation with a period of 31.935 ± 0.0098 min and an amplitude from a Fourier series fit of 0.236 mag for BLAP-009. The analysis of BLAP-014 identifies a period of 33.625 ± 0.0214 min and an amplitude of 0.225 mag. Analysis of the residual light curves reveals no additional short-period variability down to an amplitude of 15.20 ± 0.26 mmag for BLAP-009 and 58.60 ± 3.44 mmag for BLAP-014 for minimum periods of 20 and 60 s, respectively. These results further confirm that the BLAPs are monoperiodic.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.1105M,[]
Classifying Single Stars and Spectroscopic Binaries Using Optical Stellar Templates,"Stellar spectral classification is a fundamental tool of modern astronomy, providing insight into physical characteristics such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity. Accurate and fast spectral typing is an integral need for large all-sky spectroscopic surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope. Here, we present the next version of PyHammer, a stellar spectral classification software that uses optical spectral templates and spectral line index measurements. PyHammer v2.0 extends the classification power to include dwarf carbon stars, DA white dwarf stars, and also double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2). This release also includes a new empirical library of luminosity-normalized spectra that can be used to flux calibrate observed spectra or to create synthetic SB2 spectra. We have generated physically reasonable SB2 combinations as templates, adding the ability to spectrally type SB2s to PyHammer. We test classification success rates on SB2 spectra, generated from the SDSS, across a wide range of spectral types and signal-to-noise ratios. Within the defined range of pairings described, more than 95% of SB2s are correctly classified.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJS..249...34R,[]
Gaia 18dvy: A New FUor in the Cygnus OB3 Association,"We present optical-infrared photometric and spectroscopic observations of Gaia 18dvy, located in the Cygnus OB3 association at a distance of 1.88 kpc. Gaia 18dvy was noted by the Gaia alerts system when its light curve exhibited a ≳4 mag rise in 2018-2019. The brightening was also observable at mid-infared wavelengths. The infrared colors of Gaia 18dvy became bluer as the outburst progressed. Its optical and near-infrared spectroscopic characteristics in the outburst phase are consistent with those of bona fide FU Orionis-type young eruptive stars. The progenitor of the outburst is probably a low-mass K-type star with an optical extinction of ∼3 mag. A radiative transfer modeling of the circumstellar structure, based on the quiescent spectral energy distribution, indicates a disk with a mass of 4 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Our simple accretion disk modeling implies that the accretion rate had been exponentially increasing for more than 3 yr until mid-2019, when it reached a peak value of 6.9 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. In many respects, Gaia 18dvy is similar to the FU Ori-type object HBC 722.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...899..130S,[]
X-Ray Properties of Young Radio Quasars at z > 4.5,"We present a comprehensive analysis of Chandra X-ray observations of 15 young radio quasars at redshifts 4.5 < z < 5.0. All sources are detected in the 0.5-7.0 keV energy band. Emission spectra are extracted, and the average photon index for the sample is measured to be 1.5 ± 0.1. Unabsorbed rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosities are found to range between (0.5-23.2) × 10<SUP>45</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The optical-X-ray power-law spectral index ${\alpha }_{\mathrm{ox}}$ is calculated for each source using optical/UV data available in the literature. The ${\alpha }_{\mathrm{ox}}$ -UV relationship is compared with other quasar surveys, and an anticorrelation is observed that agrees with independent estimates. Rest-frame radio and X-ray luminosities are established for the sample, and a correlation between the luminosities is detected. These multiwavelength results reinforce a lack of spectral evolution for quasars over a broad redshift range. We additionally identify three quasars from our multiwavelength analysis that are statistically significant outliers, with one source being a Compton-thick candidate in the early universe, and discuss each in detail.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...899..127S,[]
Gigayear-timescale Destruction of High-eccentricity Asteroids by Spin and Why 2006 HY51 Has Been Spared,"Asteroids and other small celestial bodies have markedly prolate shapes, and the perturbative triaxial torques that are applied during pericenter passages in highly eccentric orbits trigger and sustain a state of chaotic rotation. Because the prograde spin rate around the principal axis of inertia is not bounded from above, it can accidentally reach the threshold value corresponding to rotational breakup. Previous investigations of this process were limited to integrations of ∼10<SUP>3</SUP> orbits because of the stiff equation of motion. We present here a fast 1D simulation method to compute the evolution of this spin rate over ∼10<SUP>9</SUP> orbits. We apply the method to the most eccentric solar system asteroid known, 2006 HY51 (with e = 0.9684), and find that for any reasonably expected shape parameters it can never be accelerated to breakup speed. However, primordial solar system asteroids on more eccentric orbits may have already broken up from this type of rotational fission. The method also represents a promising opportunity to investigate the long-term evolution of extremely eccentric triaxial exo-asteroids (e > 0.99), which are thought to be common in white dwarf planetary systems.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...899..103M,[]
A Systematic Study on the Rise Time-Peak Luminosity Relation for Bright Optical Transients Powered by Wind Shock Breakout,"A number of astrophysical transients originating from stellar explosions are powered by the collision of the ejected material with the circumstellar medium, which efficiently produces thermal radiation via shock dissipation. We investigate how such interaction-powered transients are distributed in the peak bolometric luminosity versus the rise time phase space. Taking advantage of less time-consuming one-dimensional simulations with spherical symmetry, we calculated more than 500 models with different circumstellar mass and radius, ejecta mass and energy, and chemical compositions. The peak bolometric luminosity, the total radiated energy, and the rise time of the interaction-powered emission are measured for each simulated light curve. We consider how these characteristic quantities are determined as a function of the model parameters and discuss possible implications for the observed populations of (potential) interaction-powered transients, such as Type IIn supernovae and fast blue optical transients.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...899...56S,[]
Early Ultraviolet Observations of Type IIn Supernovae Constrain the Asphericity of Their Circumstellar Material,"We present a survey of the early evolution of 12 Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) at ultraviolet and visible light wavelengths. We use this survey to constrain the geometry of the circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding SN IIn explosions, which may shed light on their progenitor diversity. In order to distinguish between aspherical and spherical CSM, we estimate the blackbody radius temporal evolution of the SNe IIn of our sample, following the method introduced by Soumagnac et al. We find that higher-luminosity objects tend to show evidence for aspherical CSM. Depending on whether this correlation is due to physical reasons or to some selection bias, we derive a lower limit between 35% and 66% for the fraction of SNe IIn showing evidence for aspherical CSM. This result suggests that asphericity of the CSM surrounding SNe IIn is common—consistent with data from resolved images of stars undergoing considerable mass loss. It should be taken into account for more realistic modeling of these events.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...899...51S,[]
TOI-1728b: The Habitable-zone Planet Finder Confirms a Warm Super-Neptune Orbiting an M-dwarf Host,"We confirm the planetary nature of TOI-1728b using a combination of ground-based photometry, near-infrared Doppler velocimetry and spectroscopy with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder. TOI-1728 is an old, inactive M0 star with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = ${3980}_{-32}^{+31}$ K, which hosts a transiting super-Neptune at an orbital period of ∼3.49 days. Joint fitting of the radial velocities and TESS and ground-based transits yields a planetary radius of ${5.05}_{-0.17}^{+0.16}$ R<SUB>⊕</SUB>, mass ${26.78}_{-5.13}^{+5.43}$ M<SUB>⊕</SUB>, and eccentricity ${0.057}_{-0.039}^{+0.054}$ . We estimate the stellar properties, and perform a search for He 10830 Šabsorption during the transit of this planet and claim a null detection with an upper limit of 1.1% with 90% confidence. A deeper level of He 10830 Šabsorption has been detected in the planet atmosphere of GJ 3470b, a comparable gaseous planet. TOI-1728b is the largest super-Neptune—the intermediate subclass of planets between Neptune and the more massive gas-giant planets—discovered around an M dwarf. With its relatively large mass and radius, TOI-1728 represents a valuable data point in the M-dwarf exoplanet mass-radius diagram, bridging the gap between the lighter Neptune-sized planets and the heavier Jovian planets known to orbit M dwarfs. With a low bulk density of ${1.14}_{-0.24}^{+0.26}$ g cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, and orbiting a bright host star (J ∼ 9.6, V ∼ 12.4), TOI-1728b is also a promising candidate for transmission spectroscopy both from the ground and from space, which can be used to constrain planet formation and evolutionary models.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...899...29K,[]
Detections of Simultaneous Brightening of γ-Ray and Optical Emissions of a Distant Blazar GB 1508+5714 at Redshift 4.3,"GB 1508+5714 is a high-redshift blazar (z = 4.3), and a spectrally soft γ-ray source has been detected in its direction. By analyzing 11.4 yr Fermi Large Area Telescope data, significant long-term variability of the γ-ray source is confirmed. More importantly, a γ-ray emission flare appeared in an epoch of several tens of days in 2018, when the flux was about four times the value from the global fit. Meanwhile, optical flares were displayed in both the r and i bands from the Zwicky Transient Facility light curves. Detections of the simultaneous γ-ray and optical brightening provide decisive evidence to pin down the association between the γ-ray source and GB 1508+5714, which makes it the first identified γ-ray blazar beyond redshift 4. A broadband spectral energy distribution in the high flux state is constructed, and the origin of the multiwavelength brightening is also briefly discussed. Upcoming wide-deep-fast optical telescopes together with the γ-ray sky surveyors will shed light on the role that the active galactic nucleus jets play in the early cosmic time.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...898L..56L,[]
Of Harbingers and Higher Modes: Improved Gravitational-wave Early Warning of Compact Binary Mergers,"A crucial component to maximizing the science gain from the multi-messenger follow-up of gravitational-wave (GW) signals from compact binary mergers is the prompt discovery of the electromagnetic counterpart. Ideally, the GW detection and localization must be reported early enough to allow for telescopes to slew to the location of the GW event before the onset of the counterpart. However, the time available for early warning is limited by the short duration spent by the dominant (ℓ = m = 2) mode within the detector's frequency band. Nevertheless, we show that including higher modes—which enter the detector's sensitivity band well before the dominant mode—in GW searches can enable us to significantly improve the early warning ability for compact binaries with asymmetric masses (such as neutron star-black hole (NSBH) binaries). We investigate the reduction in the localization sky-area when the ℓ = m = 3 and ℓ = m = 4 modes are included in addition to the dominant mode, considering typical slew-times of electromagnetic telescopes (30-60 s). We find that, in LIGO's projected ""O5"" (""Voyager"") network with five GW detectors, some of the NSBH mergers, located at a distance of 40 Mpc, can be localized to a few hundred sq. deg. ∼45 s prior to the merger, corresponding to a reduction-factor of 3-4 (5-6) in sky-area. For a third-generation network, we get gains of up to 1.5 min in early warning times for a localization area of 100 sq. deg., even when the source is placed at 100 Mpc.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...898L..39K,[]
SN 2019ehk: A Double-peaked Ca-rich Transient with Luminous X-Ray Emission and Shock-ionized Spectral Features,"We present panchromatic observations and modeling of the Calcium-rich supernova (SN) 2019ehk in the star-forming galaxy M100 (d ≈ 16.2 Mpc) starting 10 hr after explosion and continuing for ∼300 days. SN 2019ehk shows a double-peaked optical light curve peaking at t = 3 and 15 days. The first peak is coincident with luminous, rapidly decaying Swift-XRT-discovered X-ray emission ( ${L}_{{\rm{x}}}\approx {10}^{41}\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ at 3 days; L<SUB>x</SUB> ∝ t<SUP>-3</SUP>), and a Shane/Kast spectral detection of narrow Hα and He II emission lines (v ≈ 500 $\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ ) originating from pre-existent circumstellar material (CSM). We attribute this phenomenology to radiation from shock interaction with extended, dense material surrounding the progenitor star at r < 10<SUP>15</SUP> cm and the resulting cooling emission. We calculate a total CSM mass of ∼7 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> ${M}_{\odot }$ (M<SUB>He</SUB>/M<SUB>H</SUB> ≈6) with particle density n ≈ 10<SUP>9</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. Radio observations indicate a significantly lower density n < 10<SUP>4</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> at larger radii r > (0.1-1) × 10<SUP>17</SUP> cm. The photometric and spectroscopic properties during the second light-curve peak are consistent with those of Ca-rich transients (rise-time of t<SUB>r</SUB> = 13.4 ± 0.210 days and a peak B-band magnitude of M<SUB>B</SUB> = -15.1 ± 0.200 mag). We find that SN 2019ehk synthesized (3.1 ± 0.11) × 10<SUP>-2</SUP> ${M}_{\odot }$ of ${}^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and ejected M<SUB>ej</SUB> = (0.72 ± 0.040) ${M}_{\odot }$ total with a kinetic energy E<SUB>k</SUB> = (1.8 ± 0.10) × 10<SUP>50</SUP> erg. Finally, deep HST pre-explosion imaging at the SN site constrains the parameter space of viable stellar progenitors to massive stars in the lowest mass bin (∼10 ${M}_{\odot }$ ) in binaries that lost most of their He envelope or white dwarfs (WDs). The explosion and environment properties of SN 2019ehk further restrict the potential WD progenitor systems to low-mass hybrid HeCO WD+CO WD binaries.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...898..166J,[]
Ground deformation and fissure activity of the Yuncheng Basin (China) revealed by multiband time series InSAR,"The Yuncheng Basin (China) is affected by severe land subsidence and ground fissure hazards, which have caused serious land damage and economic losses to the local inhabitants. Due to the lack of long-term continuous monitoring in the region, the trend of land subsidence and fissure activities is unknown, which cannot meet requirements for disaster reduction and disaster prevention. In this study, Envisat ASAR, ALOS PALSAR, and TerraSAR-X are employed to monitor these hazards using time series InSAR methodology. The results showed that there were two obvious subsidence centers occurred in Yuncheng. Compared to the period from 2007 to 2011, the land subsidence rate in the Yuncheng Basin from 2012 to 2015 decreased significantly. Analysis of the differential deformation rate observed by InSAR between the two sides of the ground fissure indicates that fissure activity has weakened in recent years at the cross-section. To explain the phenomena observed by InSAR, FLAC3D was used to study the effect of pumping on ground fissure activity under the condition of pre-existing faults, and the results show that pumping promotes differential activities between two sides of the fault and has a positive impact on the occurrence and the activity of ground fissures. Horizontal rectangular sill with uniform opening model is used to simulate the land subsidence and invert the pumping depth. The results are basically consistent with the local situation.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AdSpR..66..490Y,[]
Physical Characterization of Interstellar Comet 2I/2019 Q4 (Borisov),"We present a study of interstellar comet 2I/2019 Q4 (Borisov) using both preperihelion and postperihelion observations spanning late September 2019 through late January 2020. The intrinsic brightness of the comet was observed to continuously decline throughout the timespan, likely due to the decreasing effective scattering cross-section as a result of volatile sublimation with a slope of -0.43 ± 0.02 km<SUP>2</SUP> d<SUP>-1</SUP>. We witnessed no significant change in the slightly reddish color of the comet, with mean values of $\left\langle g-r\right\rangle =0.68\pm 0.04$ , $\left\langle r-i\right\rangle =0.23\pm 0.03$ , and the normalized reflectivity gradient across the g and i bands $\overline{S^{\prime} }\left(g,i\right)=\left(10.6\pm 1.4\right)$ % per 10<SUP>3</SUP> Å, all unremarkable in the context of solar system comets. Using the available astrometric observations, we confidently detect the nongravitational acceleration of the comet following a shallow heliocentric distance dependence of ${r}_{{\rm{H}}}^{-1\pm 1}$ . Accordingly, we estimate that the nucleus is most likely $\lesssim 0.4$ km in radius, and that a fraction of ≳0.2% of the total mass of the nucleus has been eroded due to the sublimation activity since the earliest observation of the comet in 2018 December by the time of perihelion. Our morphology simulation suggests that the dust ejection speed increased from ∼4 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> in 2019 September to ∼7 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> around perihelion for the optically dominant dust grains with $\beta \sim 0.01$ , and that the observable dust grains are no smaller than micron size.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160...92H,[]
Galaxy optical variability of Virgo cluster: new tracer for environmental influences on galaxies,We investigate the relationship between the optical variability of galaxies and their distances from the centre of the Virgo cluster using Palomar Transient Factory data. We define the ratio between the standard deviation of the galaxy brightness and the mean value of the standard deviation as a measure of a galaxy's optical variability. A sample of 814 Virgo galaxies with 230 263 observations shows a monotonically decreasing trend of optical variability with increasing clustercentric distance. The variability level inside the cluster is 3.2σ higher than the level outside. We fit the variability with a linear function and find that the data reject a distance-independent model. We examine 217 background galaxies for comparison and find no significant trend in galaxy variability. We assess the relation with Monte Carlo simulation by rebuilding the brightness of each galaxy. The simulation shows a monotonically decreasing relation for member galaxy variability and a distance-independent relation for background galaxies. Our result is consistent with the theory that the cold gas flowing inwards the cluster centre fuels AGN activity. This work is a new implementation of the method using optical variability to investigate the relation between galaxies evolution and their environment.,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496L..59Y,[]
Observing the earliest moments of supernovae using strong gravitational lenses,"We determine the viability of exploiting lensing time delays to observe strongly gravitationally lensed supernovae (gLSNe) from first light. Assuming a plausible discovery strategy, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) will discover ∼110 and ∼1 systems per year before the supernova (SN) explosion in the final image, respectively. Systems will be identified $11.7^{+29.8}_{-9.3}$ d before the final explosion. We then explore the possibility of performing early-time observations for Type IIP and Type Ia SNe in LSST-discovered systems. Using a simulated Type IIP explosion, we predict that the shock breakout in one trailing image per year will peak at ≲24.1 mag (≲23.3) in the B-band (F218W), however evolving over a time-scale of ∼30 min. Using an analytic model of Type Ia companion interaction, we find that in the B-band we should observe at least one shock cooling emission event per year that peaks at ≲26.3 mag (≲29.6) assuming all Type Ia gLSNe have a 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> red giant (main sequence) companion. We perform Bayesian analysis to investigate how well deep observations with 1 h exposures on the European Extremely Large Telescope would discriminate between Type Ia progenitor populations. We find that if all Type Ia SNe evolved from the double-degenerate channel, then observations of the lack of early blue flux in 10 (50) trailing images would rule out more than 27 per cent (19 per cent) of the population having 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> main sequence companions at 95 per cent confidence.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.495.4622F,[]
Examining supernova events in Type 1 active galactic nuclei,"A statistical study of intermediate Palomar Transient Factory supernovae (SNe) in Type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has shown a major deficit of supernovae around Type 1 AGN host galaxies, with respect to Type 2 AGN hosts. The aim of this work is to test whether there is any preference for Type 1 AGNs to host SN of a specific kind. Through the analysis of SN occurrence and their type (thermonuclear versus core-collapse), we can directly link the type of stars producing the SN events, thus this is an indirect way to study host galaxies in Type 1 AGNs. We examine the detection fractions of SNe, the host galaxies and compare the sample properties to typical host galaxies in the Open Supernova Catalog (OSC). The majority of the host galaxies in the AGN sample are late type, similar to typical galaxies hosting SN within the OSC. The findings are supportive of a deficiency of SNe near Type 1 AGNs, although we cannot with certainty assess the overall detection fractions of SNe in Type 1 AGNs relative to other SN host galaxies. We can state that Type 1 AGN has equal detection fractions of thermonuclear versus core-collapse SNe. However, we note the possibility of a higher detection rate of core-collapse supernovae in Type 1 AGN with insecure AGN classifications.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.495.4419V,[]
Dynamic scheduling: target of opportunity observations of gravitational wave events,"The simultaneous detection of electromagnetic and gravitational waves from the coalescence of two neutron stars (GW170817 and GRB170817A) has ushered in a new era of 'multimessenger' astronomy, with electromagnetic detections spanning from gamma to radio. This great opportunity for new scientific investigations raises the issue of how the available multimessenger tools can best be integrated to constitute a powerful method to study the transient Universe in particular. To facilitate the classification of possible optical counterparts to gravitational wave events, it is important to optimize the scheduling of observations and the filtering of transients, both key elements of the follow-up process. In this work, we describe the existing workflow whereby telescope networks such as GRANDMA and GROWTH are currently scheduled; we then present modifications we have developed for the scheduling process specifically, so as to face the relevant challenges that have appeared during the latest observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. We address issues with scheduling more than one epoch for multiple fields within a skymap, especially for large and disjointed localizations. This is done in two ways: by optimizing the maximum number of fields that can be scheduled and by splitting up the lobes within the skymap by right ascension to be scheduled individually. In addition, we implement the ability to take previously observed fields into consideration when rescheduling. We show the improvements that these modifications produce in making the search for optical counterparts more efficient, and we point to areas needing further improvement.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.495.4366A,[]
Spikey: self-lensing flares from eccentric SMBH binaries,"We examine the light curves of two quasars, motivated by recent suggestions that a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) can exhibit sharp lensing spikes. We model the variability of each light curve as due to a combination of two relativistic effects: the orbital relativistic Doppler boost and gravitational binary self-lensing. In order to model each system, we extend previous Doppler plus self-lensing models to include eccentricity. The first quasar is identified in optical data as a binary candidate with a 20-yr period (Ark 120), and shows a prominent spike. For this source, we rule out the lensing hypothesis and disfavour the Doppler-boost hypothesis due to discrepancies in the measured versus recovered values of the binary mass and optical spectral slope. The second source, which we nickname Spikey, is the rare case of an active galactic nucleus identified in Kepler's high-quality, high-cadence photometric data. For this source, we find a model, consisting of a combination of Doppler modulation and a narrow symmetric lensing spike, consistent with an eccentric SMBHB with a mass of M<SUB>tot</SUB> = 3 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, rest-frame orbital period T = 418 d, eccentricity e = 0.5, and seen at an inclination of 8<SUP>○</SUP> from edge-on. This interpretation can be tested by monitoring Spikey for periodic behaviour and recurring flares in the next few years. In preparation for such monitoring, we present the first X-ray observations of this object taken by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.495.4061H,[]
"Supernova host galaxies in the dark energy survey: I. Deep coadds, photometry, and stellar masses","The 5-yr Dark Energy Survey Supernova Programme (DES-SN) is one of the largest and deepest transient surveys to date in terms of volume and number of supernovae. Identifying and characterizing the host galaxies of transients plays a key role in their classification, the study of their formation mechanisms, and the cosmological analyses. To derive accurate host galaxy properties, we create depth-optimized coadds using single-epoch DES-SN images that are selected based on sky and atmospheric conditions. For each of the five DES-SN seasons, a separate coadd is made from the other four seasons such that each SN has a corresponding deep coadd with no contaminating SN emission. The coadds reach limiting magnitudes of order ∼27 in g band, and have a much smaller magnitude uncertainty than the previous DES-SN host templates, particularly for faint objects. We present the resulting multiband photometry of host galaxies for samples of spectroscopically confirmed type Ia (SNe Ia), core-collapse (CCSNe), and superluminous (SLSNe) as well as rapidly evolving transients (RETs) discovered by DES-SN. We derive host galaxy stellar masses and probabilistically compare stellar-mass distributions to samples from other surveys. We find that the DES spectroscopically confirmed sample of SNe Ia selects preferentially fewer high-mass hosts at high-redshift compared to other surveys, while at low redshift the distributions are consistent. DES CCSNe and SLSNe hosts are similar to other samples, while RET hosts are unlike the hosts of any other transients, although these differences have not been disentangled from selection effects.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.495.4040W,[]
LAMOST J202629.80+423652.0 is not a symbiotic star,"LAMOST J202629.80+423652.0 has been recently classified as a new symbiotic star containing a long-period Mira, surrounded by dust (D-type) and displaying in the optical spectra high ionization emission lines, including the Raman-scattered OVI at 6825 Å. We have observed LAMOST J202629.80+423652.0 photometrically in the BVRI bands and spectroscopically over the 3500-8000 Å range. We have found it to be a normal G8 IV sub-giant star, deprived of any emission line in its spectrum, and reddened by E<SUB>B-V</SUB>=0.35 mag. Combining our photometry with data from all-sky patrol surveys, we find LAMOST J202629.80+423652.0 to be non variable, so not pulsating as a Mira. We have compiled from existing sources its spectral energy distribution, extending well into the mid-Infrared, and found it completely dominated by the G8 IV photospheric stellar emission, without any sign of circumstellar dust. We therefore conclude that LAMOST J202629.80+423652.0 is not a symbiotic star, nor it is pulsating or been enshrouded in dust.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020CoSka..50..672A,[]
The Zwicky Transient Facility Catalog of Periodic Variable Stars,"The number of known periodic variables has grown rapidly in recent years. Thanks to its large field of view and faint limiting magnitude, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) offers a unique opportunity to detect variable stars in the northern sky. Here, we exploit ZTF Data Release 2 (DR2) to search for and classify variables down to r ∼ 20.6 mag. We classify 781,602 periodic variables into 11 main types using an improved classification method. Comparison with previously published catalogs shows that 621,702 objects (79.5%) are newly discovered or newly classified, including ∼700 Cepheids, ∼5000 RR Lyrae stars, ∼15,000 δ Scuti variables, ∼350,000 eclipsing binaries, ∼100,000 long-period variables, and about 150,000 rotational variables. The typical misclassification rate and period accuracy are on the order of 2% and 99%, respectively. 74% of our variables are located at Galactic latitudes, $| b|  10^\circ $ . This large sample of Cepheids, RR Lyrae, δ Scuti stars, and contact (EW-type) eclipsing binaries is helpful to investigate the Galaxy's disk structure and evolution with an improved completeness, areal coverage, and age resolution. Specifically, the northern warp and the disk's edge at distances of 15-20 kpc are significantly better covered than previously. Among rotational variables, RS Canum Venaticorum and BY Draconis-type variables can be separated easily. Our knowledge of stellar chromospheric activity would benefit greatly from a statistical analysis of these types of variables.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJS..249...18C,[]
Microlensing Optical Depth and Event Rate in the OGLE-IV Galactic Plane Fields,"Searches for gravitational microlensing events are traditionally concentrated on the central regions of the Galactic bulge but many microlensing events are expected to occur in the Galactic plane, far from the Galactic Center. Owing to the difficulty in conducting high-cadence observations of the Galactic plane over its vast area, which are necessary for the detection of microlensing events, their global properties were hitherto unknown. Here, we present results of the first comprehensive search for microlensing events in the Galactic plane. We searched an area of almost 3000 square degrees along the Galactic plane ( $| b|  7^\circ $ , 0° < l < 50°, 190° < l < 360°) observed by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) during 2013-2019 and detected 630 events. We demonstrate that the mean Einstein timescales of Galactic plane microlensing events are on average three times longer than those of Galactic bulge events, with little dependence on the Galactic longitude. We also measure the microlensing optical depth and event rate as a function of Galactic longitude and demonstrate that they exponentially decrease with the angular distance from the Galactic Center (with the characteristic angular scale length of 32°). The average optical depth decreases from 0.5 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> at l = 10° to 1.5 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> in the Galactic anticenter. We also find that the optical depth in the longitude range 240° < l < 330° is asymmetric about the Galactic equator, which we interpret as a signature of the Galactic warp.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJS..249...16M,[]
A New Class of Roche Lobe-filling Hot Subdwarf Binaries,"We present the discovery of the second binary with a Roche lobe-filling hot subdwarf transferring mass to a white dwarf (WD) companion. This 56 minute binary was discovered using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility. Spectroscopic observations reveal an He-sdOB star with an effective temperature of T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 33,700 ± 1000 K and a surface gravity of log(g) = 5.54 ± 0.11. The GTC+HiPERCAM light curve is dominated by the ellipsoidal deformation of the He-sdOB star and shows an eclipse of the He-sdOB by an accretion disk as well as a weak eclipse of the WD. We infer a He-sdOB mass of M<SUB>sdOB</SUB> = 0.41 ± 0.04 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a WD mass of M<SUB>WD</SUB> = 0.68 ± 0.05 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The weak eclipses imply a WD blackbody temperature of 63,000 ± 10,000 K and a radius R<SUB>WD</SUB> = 0.0148 ± 0.0020 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> as expected for a WD of such high temperature. The He-sdOB star is likely undergoing hydrogen shell burning and will continue transferring mass for ≈1 Myr at a rate of 10<SUP>-9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is consistent with the high WD temperature. The hot subdwarf will then turn into a WD and the system will merge in ≈30 Myr. We suggest that Galactic reddening could bias discoveries toward preferentially finding Roche lobe-filling systems during the short-lived shell-burning phase. Studies using reddening-corrected samples should reveal a large population of helium core-burning hot subdwarfs with T<SUB>eff</SUB> ≈ 25,000 K in binaries of 60-90 minutes with WDs. Though not yet in contact, these binaries would eventually come into contact through gravitational-wave emission and explode as a subluminous thermonuclear supernova or evolve into a massive single WD.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...898L..25K,[]
The Spectacular Ultraviolet Flash from the Peculiar Type Ia Supernova 2019yvq,"Early observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide essential clues for understanding the progenitor system that gave rise to the terminal thermonuclear explosion. We present exquisite observations of SN 2019yvq, the second observed SN Ia, after iPTF 14atg, to display an early flash of emission in the ultraviolet (UV) and optical. Our analysis finds that SN 2019yvq was unusual, even when ignoring the initial flash, in that it was moderately underluminous for an SN Ia ( ${M}_{g}\approx -18.5$ mag at peak) yet featured very high absorption velocities ( $v\approx 15{\rm{,0}}00$ km s<SUP>-1</SUP> for Si II λ6355 at peak). We find that many of the observational features of SN 2019yvq, aside from the flash, can be explained if the explosive yield of radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni is relatively low (we measure ${M}_{{56}_{\mathrm{Ni}}}=0.31\pm 0.05\,{M}_{\odot }$ ) and it and other iron-group elements are concentrated in the innermost layers of the ejecta. To explain both the UV/optical flash and peak properties of SN 2019yvq we consider four different models: interaction between the SN ejecta and a nondegenerate companion, extended clumps of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni in the outer ejecta, a double-detonation explosion, and the violent merger of two white dwarfs. Each of these models has shortcomings when compared to the observations; it is clear additional tuning is required to better match SN 2019yvq. In closing, we predict that the nebular spectra of SN 2019yvq will feature either H or He emission, if the ejecta collided with a companion, strong [Ca II] emission, if it was a double detonation, or narrow [O I] emission, if it was due to a violent merger.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...898...56M,[]
Comparing Moment-based and Monte Carlo Methods of Radiation Transport Modeling for Type II-Plateau Supernova Light Curves,"Time-dependent electromagnetic signatures from core-collapse supernovae are the result of detailed transport of the shock-deposited and radioactively powered radiation through the stellar ejecta. Due to the complexity of the underlying radiative processes, considerable approximations are made to simplify key aspects of the radiation transport problem. We present a systematic comparison of the moment-based radiation hydrodynamical code STELLA and the Monte Carlo radiation transport code Sedona in the 1D modeling of Type II-Plateau supernovae. Based on explosion models generated from the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics instrument, we find remarkable agreements in the modeled light curves and the ejecta structure thermal evolution, affirming the fidelity of both radiation transport modeling approaches. The radiative moments computed directly by the Monte Carlo scheme in Sedona also verify the accuracy of the moment-based scheme. We find that the coarse resolutions of the opacity tables and the numerical approximations in STELLA have an insignificant impact on the resulting bolometric light curves, making it an efficient tool for the specific task of optical light-curve modeling.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...898...29T,[]
Intermediate Luminosity Red Transients by Black Holes Born from Erupting Massive Stars,"We consider black hole formation in failed supernovae when a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) is present around the massive star progenitor. By utilizing radiation hydrodynamical simulations, we calculate the mass ejection of blue supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars in the collapsing phase and the radiative shock occurring between the ejecta and the ambient CSM. We find that the resultant emission is redder and dimmer than normal supernovae (bolometric luminosity of 10<SUP>40</SUP>- ${10}^{41}\ \mathrm{erg}\ {{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ , effective temperature of ∼5 × 10<SUP>3</SUP> K, and timescale of 10-100 days) and shows a characteristic power-law decay, which may comprise a fraction of intermediate luminosity red transients (ILRTs) including AT 2017be. In addition to searching for the progenitor star in the archival data, we encourage X-ray follow-up observations of such ILRTs ∼1-10 yr after the collapse, targeting the fallback accretion disk.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897L..44T,[]
Image-based Classification of Variable Stars: First Results from Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment Data,"Recently, machine learning methods have presented a viable solution for the automated classification of image-based data in various research fields and business applications. Scientists require a fast and reliable solution in order to handle increasingly large amounts of astronomical data. However, so far astronomers have been mainly classifying variable starlight curves based on various pre-computed statistics and light curve parameters. In this work we use an image-based Convolutional Neural Network to classify the different types of variable stars. We use images of phase-folded light curves from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE)-III survey for training, validating, and testing, and use OGLE-IV survey as an independent data set for testing. After the training phase, our neural network was able to classify the different types between 80% and 99%, and 77%-98%, accuracy for OGLE-III and OGLE-IV, respectively.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897L..12S,[]
A White Dwarf with Transiting Circumstellar Material Far outside the Roche Limit,"We report the discovery of a white dwarf exhibiting deep, irregularly shaped transits, indicative of circumstellar planetary debris. Using Zwicky Transient Facility DR2 photometry of ZTF J013906.17+524536.89 and follow-up observations from the Las Cumbres Observatory, we identify multiple transit events that recur every ≈107.2 days, much longer than the 4.5-4.9 hr orbital periods observed in WD 1145+017, the only other white dwarf known with transiting planetary debris. The transits vary in both depth and duration, lasting 15-25 days and reaching 20%-45% dips in flux. Optical spectra reveal strong Balmer lines, identifying the white dwarf as a DA with ${T}_{\mathrm{eff}}=10,530\pm 140\,{\rm{K}}$ and $\mathrm{log}(g)=7.86\pm 0.06$ . A Ca II K absorption feature is present in all spectra both in and out of transit. Spectra obtained during one night at roughly 15% transit depth show increased Ca II K absorption with a model atmospheric fit suggesting [Ca/H] = -4.6 ± 0.3, whereas spectra taken on three nights out of transit have [Ca/H] of -5.5, -5.3, and -4.9 with similar uncertainties. While the Ca II K line strength varies by only 2σ, we consider a predominantly interstellar origin for Ca absorption unlikely. We suggest a larger column density of circumstellar metallic gas along the line of site or increased accretion of material onto the white dwarf's surface are responsible for the Ca absorption, but further spectroscopic studies are required. In addition, high-speed time series photometry out of transit reveals variability with periods of 900 and 1030 s, consistent with ZZ Ceti pulsations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897..171V,[]
Constraining the Source of the High-velocity Ejecta in Type Ia SN 2019ein,"We present multiwavelength photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2019ein, a high-velocity Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 5353 with a two-day nondetection limit. SN 2019ein exhibited some of the highest measured expansion velocities of any SN Ia, with a Si II absorption minimum blueshifted by 24,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> at 14 days before peak brightness. More unusually, we observed the emission components of the P Cygni profiles to be blueshifted upward of 10,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> before B-band maximum light. This blueshift, among the highest in a sample of 28 other SNe Ia, is greatest at our earliest spectroscopic epoch and subsequently decreases toward maximum light. We discuss possible progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms that could explain these extreme absorption and emission velocities. Radio observations beginning 14 days before B-band maximum light yield nondetections at the position of SN 2019ein, which rules out symbiotic progenitor systems, most models of fast optically thick accretion winds, and optically thin shells of mass $\lesssim {10}^{-6}$ ${M}_{\odot }$ at radii $ 100\,\mathrm{au}$ . Comparing our spectra to models and observations of other high-velocity SNe Ia, we find that SN 2019ein is well fit by a delayed-detonation explosion. We propose that the high emission velocities may be the result of abundance enhancements due to ejecta mixing in an asymmetric explosion, or optical depth effects in the photosphere of the ejecta at early times. These findings may provide evidence for common explosion mechanisms and ejecta geometries among high-velocity SNe Ia.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897..159P,[]
A Wind-driven Model: Application to Peculiar Transients AT2018cow and iPTF14hls,"We propose a wind-driven model for peculiar transients, and apply the model to AT2018cow and iPTF14hls. In the wind-driven model, we assume that a continuous outflow like a stellar wind is injected from a central system. While these transients have different observational properties, this model can explain their photometric properties which are not reproduced by a supernova-like instantaneous explosion. Furthermore, the model predicts characteristic spectral features and evolution, which are well in line with those of AT2018cow and iPTF14hls. Despite the different observational properties, the wind model shows that they have some common features; the large mass-loss rates (up to $\sim 20{M}_{\odot }\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$ for AT2018cow and $\sim 75{M}_{\odot }\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$ for iPTF14hls), and the characteristic radii of $\sim {10}^{13}\,\mathrm{cm}$ for the launch of the wind. It would indicate that both may be related to events involving a red supergiant (RSG), in which the RSG envelope is rapidly ejected by an event at a stellar core scale. On the other hand, the main differences are the kinetic energies, the total ejected mass, and the timescales. We then suggest that iPTF14hls may represent a dynamical common-envelope evolution induced by a massive binary system ( $\sim 120{M}_{\odot }+100{M}_{\odot }$ ). AT2018cow may be either a tidal disruption event of a low-mass RSG by a black hole (BH), or a BH-forming failed supernova.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897..156U,[]
Gravitational Microlensing Event Statistics for the Zwicky Transient Facility,"Microlensing surveys have discovered thousands of events, with almost all events discovered within the Galactic bulge or toward the Magellanic Clouds. The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), while not designed to be a microlensing campaign, is an optical time-domain survey that observes the entire northern sky, including the Galactic plane, every few nights. The ZTF observes ∼10<SUP>9</SUP> stars in the g and r bands and can significantly contribute to the observed microlensing population. We predict that the ZTF will observe ∼1100 microlensing events in 3 yr of observing within 10° latitude of the Galactic plane, with ∼500 events in the outer Galaxy (ℓ ≥ 10°). This yield increases to ∼1400 (∼800) events by combining every three ZTF exposures, ∼1800 (∼900) events if the ZTF observes for a total of 5 yr, and ∼2400 (∼1300) events for a 5 yr survey with postprocessing image stacking. Using the microlensing modeling software PopSyCLE, we compare the microlensing populations in the Galactic bulge and the outer Galaxy. We also present an analysis of the microlensing event ZTF18abhxjmj to demonstrate how to leverage these population statistics in event modeling. The ZTF will constrain Galactic structure, stellar populations, and primordial black holes through photometric microlensing.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897..144M,[]
The Pre-explosion Mass Distribution of Hydrogen-poor Superluminous Supernova Progenitors and New Evidence for a Mass-Spin Correlation,"Despite indications that superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) originate from massive progenitors, the lack of a uniformly analyzed statistical sample has so far prevented a detailed view of the progenitor mass distribution. Here we present and analyze the pre-explosion mass distribution of hydrogen-poor SLSN progenitors as determined from uniformly modeled light curves of 62 events. We construct the distribution by summing the ejecta mass posteriors of each event, using magnetar light-curve models presented in our previous works (and using a nominal neutron star remnant mass). The resulting distribution spans 3.6-40 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with a sharp decline at lower masses, and is best fit by a broken power law described by ${dN}/d\mathrm{log}M\propto {M}^{-0.41\pm 0.06}$ at 3.6-8.6 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and $\propto {M}^{-1.26\pm 0.06}$ at 8.6-40 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We find that observational selection effects cannot account for the shape of the distribution. Relative to Type Ib/c SNe, the SLSN mass distribution extends to much larger masses and has a different power-law shape, likely indicating that the formation of a magnetar allows more massive stars to explode as some of the rotational energy accelerates the ejecta. Comparing the SLSN distribution with predictions from single and binary star evolution models, we find that binary models for a metallicity of Z ≲ 1/3 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB> are best able to reproduce its broad shape, in agreement with the preference of SLSNe for low metallicity environments. Finally, we uncover a correlation between the pre-explosion mass and the magnetar initial spin period, where SLSNe with low masses have slower spins, a trend broadly consistent with the effects of angular momentum transport evident in models of rapidly rotating carbon-oxygen stars.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897..114B,[]
Continuum-fitting the X-Ray Spectra of Tidal Disruption Events,"We develop a new model for X-ray emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs), applying stationary general relativistic ""slim disk"" accretion solutions to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and then ray-tracing the photon trajectories from the image plane to the disk surface, including gravitational redshift, Doppler, and lensing effects self-consistently. We simultaneously and successfully fit the multi-epoch XMM-Newton X-ray spectra for two TDEs: ASASSN-14li and ASASSN-15oi. We test explanations for the observed, unexpectedly slow X-ray brightening of ASASSN-15oi, including delayed disk formation and variable obscuration by a reprocessing layer. We propose a new mechanism that better fits the data: a ""slimming disk"" scenario in which accretion onto an edge-on disk slows, reducing the disk height and exposing more X-rays from the inner disk to the sightline over time. For ASASSN-15oi, we constrain the SMBH mass to ${4.0}_{-3.1}^{+2.5}\times {10}^{6}{M}_{\odot }$ . For ASASSN-14li, the SMBH mass is ${10}_{-7}^{+1}\times {10}^{6}{M}_{\odot }$ , and the spin is >0.3. For both TDEs, our fitted masses are consistent with independent estimates; for ASASSN-14li, application of the external mass constraint narrows our spin constraint to >0.85. The mass accretion rate of ASASSN-14li decays slowly, as ∝t<SUP>-1.1</SUP>, perhaps due to inefficient debris circularization. Over ≈1100 days, its SMBH has accreted ΔM ≈ 0.17M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, implying a progenitor star mass of >0.34M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, I.e., no ""missing energy problem."" For both TDEs, the hydrogen column density declines to the host galaxy plus Milky Way value after a few hundred days, suggesting a characteristic timescale for the depletion or removal of obscuring gas.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897...80W,[]
WALLABY - an SKA Pathfinder HI survey,"The Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) is a next-generation survey of neutral hydrogen (HI) in the Local Universe. It uses the widefield, high-resolution capability of the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), a radio interferometer consisting of 36 ×12 -m dishes equipped with Phased-Array Feeds (PAFs), located in an extremely radio-quiet zone in Western Australia. WALLABY aims to survey three-quarters of the sky (-90<SUP>∘</SUP><δ <+30<SUP>∘</SUP>) to a redshift of z ≲0.26 , and generate spectral line image cubes at ∼30 arcsec resolution and ∼1.6 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP> per 4 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> channel sensitivity. ASKAP's instantaneous field of view at 1.4 GHz, delivered by the PAF's 36 beams, is about 30 sq deg. At an integrated signal-to-noise ratio of five, WALLABY is expected to detect around half a million galaxies with a mean redshift of z ∼0.05 (∼200 Mpc). The scientific goals of WALLABY include: (a) a census of gas-rich galaxies in the vicinity of the Local Group; (b) a study of the HI properties of galaxies, groups and clusters, in particular the influence of the environment on galaxy evolution; and (c) the refinement of cosmological parameters using the spatial and redshift distribution of low-bias gas-rich galaxies. For context we provide an overview of recent and planned large-scale HI surveys. Combined with existing and new multi-wavelength sky surveys, WALLABY will enable an exciting new generation of panchromatic studies of the Local Universe. — First results from the WALLABY pilot survey are revealed, with initial data products publicly available in the CSIRO ASKAP Science Data Archive (CASDA).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020Ap&SS.365..118K,[]
A Search for Extra-tidal RR Lyrae in Globular Clusters NGC 5024 and NGC 5053,"Recently, Kundu et al. reported that the globular cluster NGC 5024 (M53) possesses five extra-tidal RR Lyrae. In fact, four of them were instead known members of a nearby globular cluster NGC 5053. The status of the remaining extra-tidal RR Lyrae is controversial depending on the adopted tidal radius of NGC 5024. We have also searched for additional extra-tidal RR Lyrae within an area of ∼8 deg<SUP>2</SUP> covering both globular clusters. This includes other known RR Lyrae within the search area, as well as stars that fall within the expected range of magnitudes and colors for RR Lyrae (and yet outside the cutoff of two-thirds of the tidal radii of each globular cluster for something to be called extra-tidal) if they were extra-tidal RR Lyrae candidates for NGC 5024 or NGC 5053. Based on the the proper-motion information and their locations on the color-magnitude diagram, none of the known RR Lyrae belong to the extra-tidal RR Lyrae of either globular clusters. In the cases where the stars satisfied the magnitude and color ranges of RR Lyrae, analysis of time series data taken from the Zwicky Transient Facility do not reveal periodicities, suggesting that none of these stars are RR Lyrae. We conclude that there are no extra-tidal RR Lyrae associated with either NGC 5024 or NGC 5053 located within our search area.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160...31N,[]
"Characterization of the Nucleus, Morphology, and Activity of Interstellar Comet 2I/Borisov by Optical and Near-infrared GROWTH, Apache Point, IRTF, ZTF, and Keck Observations","We present visible and near-infrared (NIR) photometric and spectroscopic observations of interstellar object (ISO) 2I/Borisov taken from 2019 September 10 to 2019 December 20 using the GROWTH, the Apache Point Observatory Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5 m, and the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility 3.0 m combined with pre- and postdiscovery observations of 2I obtained by the Zwicky Transient Facility from 2019 March 17 to 2019 May 5. Comparison with imaging of distant solar system comets shows an object very similar to mildly active solar system comets with an outgassing rate of ∼10<SUP>27</SUP> mol s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The photometry, taken in filters spanning the visible and NIR range, shows a gradual brightening trend of ∼0.03 mag day<SUP>-1</SUP> since 2019 September 10 UTC for a reddish object becoming neutral in the NIR. The light curve from recent and prediscovery data reveals a brightness trend suggesting the recent onset of significant H<SUB>2</SUB>O sublimation with the comet being active with super volatiles such as CO at heliocentric distances >6 au consistent with its extended morphology. Using the advanced capability to significantly reduce the scattered light from the coma enabled by high-resolution NIR images from Keck adaptive optics taken on 2019 October 4, we estimate a diameter for 2I's nucleus of ≲1.4 km. We use the size estimates of 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov to roughly estimate the slope of the ISO size distribution, resulting in a slope of ∼3.4 ± 1.2, similar to solar system comets and bodies produced from collisional equilibrium.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160...26B,[]
Beyond Gaia: Asteroseismic Distances of M Giants Using Ground-based Transient Surveys,"Evolved stars near the tip of the red giant branch show solar-like oscillations with periods spanning hours to months and amplitudes ranging from ∼1 mmag to ∼100 mmag. The systematic detection of the resulting photometric variations with ground-based telescopes would enable the application of asteroseismology to a much larger and more distant sample of stars than is currently accessible with space-based telescopes such as Kepler or the ongoing Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission. We present an asteroseismic analysis of 493 M giants using data from two ground-based surveys: the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). By comparing the extracted frequencies with constraints from Kepler, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Apache Point Observatory Galaxy Evolution Experiment, and Gaia we demonstrate that ground-based transient surveys allow accurate distance measurements to oscillating M giants with a precision of ∼15%. Using stellar population synthesis models we predict that ATLAS and ASAS-SN can provide asteroseismic distances to ∼2 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> galactic M giants out to typical distances of 20-50 kpc, vastly improving the reach of Gaia and providing critical constraints for Galactic archeology and galactic dynamics.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160...18A,[]
Broad-line type Ic SN 2020bvc. Signatures of an off-axis gamma-ray burst afterglow,"Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are almost unequivocally associated with very energetic, broad-line supernovae of Type Ic-BL. While the gamma-ray emission is emitted in narrow jets, the SN emits radiation isotropically. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that some SN Ic-BL not associated with GRBs arise from events with inner engines such as off-axis GRBs or choked jets. Here we present observations of the nearby (d = 120 Mpc) SN 2020bvc (ASAS-SN 20bs) that support this scenario. Swift-UVOT observations reveal an early decline (up to two days after explosion), while optical spectra classify it as a SN Ic-BL with very high expansion velocities (≈70 000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), similar to that found for the jet-cocoon emission in SN 2017iuk associated with GRB 171205A. Moreover, the Swift X-Ray Telescope and CXO X-ray Observatory detected X-ray emission only three days after the SN and decaying onward, which can be ascribed to an afterglow component. Cocoon and X-ray emission are both signatures of jet-powered GRBs. In the case of SN 2020bvc, we find that the jet is off axis (by ≈23 degrees), as also indicated by the lack of early (≈1 day) X-ray emission, which explains why no coincident GRB was detected promptly or in archival data. These observations suggest that SN 2020bvc is the first orphan GRB detected through its associated SN emission.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A&A...639L..11I,[]
"The sustained post-outburst brightness of Nova Per 2018, the evolved companion, and the long orbital period","Nova Per 2018 (= V392 Per) halted the decline from maximum when it was 2 mag brighter than quiescence and since 2019 has been stable at such a plateau. The ejecta have already fully diluted into the interstellar space. We obtained BVRIgrizY photometry and optical spectroscopy of V392 Per during the plateau phase and compared it with equivalent data gathered prior to the nova outburst. We find the companion star (CS) to be a G9 IV/III and the orbital period to be 3.4118 days, making V392 Per the longest known period for a classical nova. The location of V392 Per on the theoretical isochrones is intermediate between that of classical novae and novae erupting within symbiotic binaries, in a sense bridging the gap. The reddening is derived to be E<SUB>B - V</SUB> = 0.72 and the fitting to isochrones returns a 3.6 Gyr age for the system and 1.35 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, 5.3 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and 15 L<SUB>⊙</SUB> for the companion. The huge Ne overabundance in the ejecta and the very fast decline from nova maximum both point to a massive white dwarf (WD) (M<SUB>WD</SUB> ≥ 1.1-1.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). The system is viewed close to pole-on conditions and the current plateau phase is caused by irradiation of the CS by the WD still burning at the surface.",,[]

Probing binary neutron star mergers in dense environments using afterglow counterparts,"The only binary neutron star merger gravitational wave event with detected electromagnetic counterparts recorded to date is GRB170817A. This merger occurred in a rarefied medium with a density smaller than 10<SUP>-3</SUP> - 10<SUP>-2</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. Since kicks are imparted to neutron star binaries upon formation, and due to their long delay times before merger, such low-density circum-merger media are generally expected. However, there is some indirect evidence for fast-merging or low-kick binaries, which would coalesce in denser environments. Nonetheless, present astronomical data are largely inconclusive on the possibility of these high-density mergers. We describe a method to directly probe this hypothetical population of high-density mergers through multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star merger afterglows, exploiting the high sensitivity of these signals to the density of the merger environment. This method is based on a sample of merger afterglows that has yet to be collected. Its constraining power is large, even with a small sample of events. We discuss the method's limitations and applicability. In the upcoming era of third-generation gravitational wave detectors, this method's potential will be fully realized as it will allow us to probe mergers that occurred soon after the peak of cosmic star formation, provided the follow-up campaigns are able to locate the sources.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A&A...639A..15D,[]
Extrasolar Enigmas: From Disintegrating Exoplanets to Exoasteroids,"Thousands of transiting exoplanets have been discovered to date, thanks in great part to the Kepler space mission. As in all populations, and certainly in the case of exoplanets, one finds unique objects with distinct characteristics. Here we will describe the properties and behaviour of a small group of 'disintegrating' exoplanets discovered over the last few years (KIC 12557548b, K2-22b, and others). They evaporate, lose mass unraveling their naked cores, produce spectacular dusty comet-like tails, and feature highly variable asymmetric transits. Apart from these exoplanets, there is observational evidence for even smaller 'exo-'objects orbiting other stars: exoasteroids and exocomets. Most probably, such objects are also behind the mystery of Boyajian's star. Ongoing and upcoming space missions such as TESS and PLATO will hopefully discover more objects of this kind, and a new era of the exploration of small extrasolar systems bodies will be upon us.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020rfma.book...45B,[]
Radio Properties of Tidal Disruption Events,"Radio observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) probe material ejected by the disruption of stars by supermassive black holes (SMBHs), uniquely tracing the formation and evolution of jets and outflows, revealing details of the disruption hydrodynamics, and illuminating the environments around previously-dormant SMBHs. To date, observations reveal a surprisingly diverse population. A small fraction of TDEs (at most a few percent) have been observed to produce radio-luminous mildly relativistic jets. The remainder of the population are radio quiet, producing less luminous jets, non-relativistic outflows or, possibly, no radio emission at all. Here, we review the radio observations that have been made of TDEs to date and discuss possible explanations for their properties, focusing on detected sources and, in particular, on the two best-studied events: Sw J1644+57 and ASASSN-14li. We also discuss what we have learned about the host galaxies of TDEs from radio observations and review constraints on the rates of bright and faint radio outflows in TDEs. Upcoming X-ray, optical, near-IR, and radio surveys will greatly expand the sample of TDEs, and technological advances open the exciting possibility of discovering a sample of TDEs in the radio band unbiased by host galaxy extinction.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020SSRv..216...81A,[]

Candidate Electromagnetic Counterpart to the Binary Black Hole Merger Gravitational-Wave Event S190521g<SUP>*</SUP>,"We report the first plausible optical electromagnetic counterpart to a (candidate) binary black hole merger. Detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility, the electromagnetic flare is consistent with expectations for a kicked binary black hole merger in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus [B. McKernan, K. E. S. Ford, I. Bartos et al., Astrophys. J. Lett. 884, L50 (2019), 10.3847/2041-8213/ab4886] and is unlikely [<O (0.01 %) )] due to intrinsic variability of this source. The lack of color evolution implies that it is not a supernova and instead is strongly suggestive of a constant temperature shock. Other false-positive events, such as microlensing or a tidal disruption event, are ruled out or constrained to be <O (0.1 %) . If the flare is associated with S190521g, we find plausible values of total mass M<SUB>BBH</SUB>∼100 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, kick velocity v<SUB>k</SUB>∼200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> at θ ∼6 0 ° in a disk with aspect ratio H /a ∼0.01 (i.e., disk height H at radius a ) and gas density ρ ∼10<SUP>-10</SUP> g cm<SUP>-3</SUP> .

The combination of parameters implies a significant spin for at least one of the black holes in S190521g.

The SN explosion times are estimated from optical light curves and we find a probability of about ∼90 % that the LAT observed at least one SN at the time of the core collapse.

"Physics of radiation mediated shocks and its applications to GRBs, supernovae, and neutron star mergers","The first electromagnetic signal observed in different types of cosmic explosions is released upon emergence of a shock created in the explosion from the opaque envelope enshrouding the central source. Notable examples are the early emission from various types of supernovae and low luminosity GRBs, the prompt photospheric emission in long GRBs, and the gamma-ray emission that accompanied the gravitational wave signal in neutron star mergers. In all of these examples, the shock driven by the explosion is mediated by the radiation trapped inside it, and its velocity and structure, that depend on environmental conditions, dictate the characteristics of the observed electromagnetic emission at early times, and potentially also their neutrino emission. Much efforts have been devoted in recent years to develop a detailed theory of radiation mediated shocks in an attempt to predict the properties of the early emission in the aforementioned systems. These efforts are timely in view of the anticipated detection rate of shock breakout candidates by upcoming transient factories, and the potential detection of a gamma-ray flash from shock breakout in neutron star mergers like GW170817. This review aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the theory and applications of radiation mediated shocks, starting from basic principles. The classification of shock solutions, which are governed by the conditions prevailing in each class of objects, and the methods used to solve the shock equations in different regimes will be described, with particular emphasis on the observational diagnostics. The applications to supernovae, low-luminosity GRBs, long GRBs, neutron star mergers, and neutrino emission will be highlighted.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhR...866....1L,[]
Synthetic Tracking Using ZTF Deep Drilling Data Sets,"The Zwicky Transit Facility (ZTF) is a powerful time domain survey telescope with a large field of view of 47 ${\deg }^{2}$ deg 2 .

First detection of two superoutbursts during the rebrightening phase of a WZ Sge-type dwarf nova: TCP J21040470+4631129,"We report on photometric and spectroscopic observations and analysis of the 2019 superoutburst of TCP J21040470+4631129. This object showed a 9 mag superoutburst with early superhumps and ordinary superhumps, which are the features of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. Five rebrightenings were observed after the main superoutburst. The spectra during the post-superoutburst stage showed Balmer, He i, and possible sodium doublet features. The mass ratio is derived as 0.0880(9) from the period of the superhump. During the third and fifth rebrightenings, growing superhumps and superoutbursts were observed, which have never been detected during a rebrightening phase among WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings. To induce a superoutburst during the brightening phase, the accretion disk needs to have expanded beyond the 3 : 1 resonance radius of the system again after the main superoutburst. These peculiar phenomena can be explained by the enhanced viscosity and large radius of the accretion disk suggested by the higher luminosity and the presence of late-stage superhumps during the post-superoutburst stage, plus by more mass supply from the cool mass reservoir and/or from the secondary because of the enhanced mass transfer than those of other WZ Sge-type dwarf novae.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASJ...72...49T,[]
Fabrication and Piezoresistive/Piezoelectric Sensing Characteristics of Carbon Nanotube/PVA/Nano-ZnO Flexible Composite,"Flexible sensors with a high sensitivity and wide-frequency response are essential for structural health monitoring (SHM) while they are attached. Here, carbon nanotube (CNT) films doped with various PVA fractions (CNT/PVA) and ZnO nanowires (nano-ZnO) on zinc sheets were first fabricated by functionalized self-assembly and hydrothermal synthesis processes. A CNT/PVA/nano-ZnO flexible composite (CNT/PVA/ZnO) sandwiched with a zinc wafer was then prepared by the spin-coating method. The piezoresistive and/or piezoelectric capabilities of the CNT/PVA/ZnO composite were comprehensively investigated under cyclic bending and impact loading after it was firmly adhered to a substrate (polypropylene sheet or mortar plate). The results show that the piezoresistive sensitivity and linear stability of the CNT/PVA films doped with 20%, 50%, and 100% PVA during bending are 5.47%/mm, 11.082%/mm, and 11.95%/mm and 2.3%, 3.42%, and 4.78%, respectively. The piezoelectric sensitivity, linear stability, and response accuracy of the CNT/PVA/ZnO composite under impulse loading are 4.87 mV/lbf, 3.42%, and 1.496 ms, respectively. These merits support the use of CNT/PVA/ZnO as a piezoresistive and/or piezoelectric compound sensor to monitor the static/dynamic loads on concrete structures while it is attached.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020NatSR..10.8895C,[]
"On building a cluster watchlist for identifying strongly lensed supernovae, gravitational waves and kilonovae","Motivated by discovering strongly lensed supernovae, gravitational waves, and kilonovae in the 2020s, we investigate whether to build a watchlist of clusters based on observed cluster properties (I.e. lens-plane selection) or on the detectability of strongly lensed background galaxies (I.e. source-plane selection). First, we estimate the fraction of high-redshift transient progenitors that reside in galaxies that are themselves too faint to be detected as being strongly lensed. We find ∼15-50 per cent of transient progenitors reside in z = 1 - 2 galaxies too faint to be detected in surveys that reach AB ≃ 23, such as the Dark Energy Survey. This falls to ≲10 per cent at depths that will be probed by early data releases of LSST (AB ≃ 25). Secondly, we estimate a conservative lower limit on the fraction of strong-lensing clusters that will be missed by magnitude-limited searches for multiply imaged galaxies and giant arcs due to the faintness of such images. We find that DES-like surveys will miss ∼75 per cent of 10<SUP>15</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> strong-lensing clusters, rising to ∼100 per cent of 10<SUP>14</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> clusters.

Correlation between optical and UV variability of a large sample of quasars,"The variability of quasars across multiple wavelengths is a useful probe of physical conditions in active galactic nuclei. In particular, variable accretion rates, instabilities, and reverberation effects in the accretion disc of a supermassive black hole are expected to produce correlated flux variations in ultraviolet (UV) and optical bands. Recent work has further argued that binary quasars should exhibit strongly correlated UV and optical periodicities. Strong UV-optical correlations have indeed been established in small samples of (N ≲ 30) quasars with well-sampled light curves, and have extended the 'bluer-when-brighter' trend previously found within the optical bands. Here, we further test the nature of quasar variability by examining the observed-frame UV-optical correlations among bright quasars extracted from the Half Million Quasars (HMQ) catalogue. We identified a large sample of 1315 quasars in HMQ with overlapping UV and optical light curves from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer and the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey, respectively. We find that strong correlations exist in this much larger sample, but we rule out, at ∼95 per cent confidence, the simple hypothesis that the intrinsic UV and optical variations of all quasars are fully correlated. Our results therefore imply the existence of physical mechanism(s) that can generate uncorrelated optical and UV flux variations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.495.1403X,[]
AT 2016dah and AT 2017fyp: the first classical novae discovered within a tidal stream,"AT 2016dah and AT 2017fyp are fairly typical Andromeda galaxy (M 31) classical novae. AT 2016dah is an almost text book example of a 'very fast' declining, yet uncommon, Fe II'b' (broad-lined) nova, discovered during the rise to peak optical luminosity, and decaying with a smooth broken power-law light curve. AT 2017fyp is classed as a 'fast' nova, unusually for M 31, its early decline spectrum simultaneously shows properties of both Fe II and He/N spectral types - a 'hybrid'. Similarly, the light curve of AT 2017fyp has a broken power-law decline but exhibits an extended flat-topped maximum. Both novae were followed in the UV and X-ray by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, but no X-ray source was detected for either nova. The pair were followed photometrically and spectroscopically into their nebular phases. The progenitor systems were not visible in archival optical data, implying that the mass donors are main-sequence stars. What makes AT 2016dah and AT 2017fyp particularly interesting is their position with respect to M 31. The pair are close on the sky but are located far from the centre of M 31, lying almost along the semiminor axis of their host. Radial velocity measurements and simulations of the M 31 nova population leads to the conclusion that both novae are members of the Andromeda Giant Stellar Stream (GSS). We find the probability of at least two M 31 novae appearing coincident with the GSS by chance is $\sim \!1{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ . Therefore, we claim that these novae arose from the GSS progenitor, not M 31 - the first confirmed novae discovered in a tidal steam.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.495.1073D,[]
The scattering of Dirac spinors in rotating spheroids,"There are many stars that are rotating spheroids in the Universe, and studying them is of very important significance. Since the times of Newton, many astronomers and physicists have researched gravitational properties of stars by considering the moment equations derived from Eulerian hydrodynamic equations. In this paper we study the scattering of spinors of the Dirac equation, and in particular investigate the scattering issue in the limit case of rotating Maclaurin spheroids. Firstly we give the metric of a rotating ellipsoid star, then write the Dirac equation under this metric, and finally derive the scattering solution to the Dirac equation and establish a relation between differential scattering cross-section, σ , and stellar matter density, μ . It is found that the sensitivity of σ to the change in μ is proportional to the density μ . Because of the weak gravitational field and the constant mass density, our results are reasonable. The results can be applied to white dwarfs, main sequence stars, red giants, supergiant stars and so on, as long as their gravitational fields are so weak that they can be treated in the Newtonan approximations, and the fluid is assumed to be incompressible. Notice that we take the star's matter density to be its average density and the star is not taken to be compact. Obviously our results cannot be used to study neutron stars and black holes. In particular, our results are suitable for white dwarfs, which have average densities of about 10<SUP>5</SUP>-10<SUP>6</SUP> g cm-<SUP>3</SUP>, corresponding to a range of mass of about 0.21 -0.61 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a range of radius of about 6000 -10 ,000 km.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020EPJC...80..582F,[]
Search for Evolutionary Changes in the Period of the Classical Cepheid EV Aql,"The reduction of all the available photometry for the Cepheid EV Aql has allowed its $O-C$ diagram spanning a time interval of 130 years to be constructed. This has made it possible to calculate the rate of evolutionary decrease in the period, $dP/dt=-33.2({±}{6.9})$ s yr${}^{-1}$, in agreement with the results of model calculations for the second crossing of the instability strip. The pulsation stability test proposed by Lombard and Koen has confirmed that the decrease in the period is real.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AstL...46..388B,[]
Zwicky Transient Facility Constraints on the Optical Emission from the Nearby Repeating FRB 180916.J0158+65,"The discovery rate of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is increasing dramatically thanks to new radio facilities. Meanwhile, wide-field instruments such as the 47 deg<SUP>2</SUP> Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey the optical sky to study transient and variable sources. We present serendipitous ZTF observations of the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) repeating source FRB 180916.J0158+65 that was localized to a spiral galaxy 149 Mpc away and is the first FRB suggesting periodic modulation in its activity. While 147 ZTF exposures corresponded to expected high-activity periods of this FRB, no single ZTF exposure was at the same time as a CHIME detection. No >3σ optical source was found at the FRB location in 683 ZTF exposures, totaling 5.69 hr of integration time. We combined ZTF upper limits and expected repetitions from FRB 180916.J0158+65 in a statistical framework using a Weibull distribution, agnostic of periodic modulation priors. The analysis yielded a constraint on the ratio between the optical and radio fluences of η ≲ 200, corresponding to an optical energy E<SUB>opt</SUB> ≲ 3 × 10<SUP>46</SUP> erg for a fiducial 10 Jy ms FRB (90% confidence). A deeper (but less statistically robust) constraint of η ≲ 3 can be placed assuming a rate of $r( 5\,\mathrm{Jy}\,\mathrm{ms})=1\,{\mathrm{hr}}^{-1}$ and 1.2 ± 1.1 FRB occurring during exposures taken in high-activity windows. The constraint can be improved with shorter per-image exposures and longer integration time, or observing FRBs at higher Galactic latitudes. This work demonstrated how current surveys can statistically constrain multiwavelength counterparts to FRBs even without deliberately scheduled simultaneous radio observation.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...896L...2A,[]
A Machine Learning-based Source Property Inference for Compact Binary Mergers,"The detection of the binary neutron star merger, GW170817, was the first success story of multi-messenger observations of compact binary mergers. The inferred merger rate, along with the increased sensitivity of the ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) network in the present LIGO/Virgo, and future LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing runs, strongly hints at detections of binaries that could potentially have an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. A rapid assessment of properties that could lead to a counterpart is essential to aid time-sensitive follow-up operations, especially robotic telescopes. At minimum, the possibility of counterparts requires a neutron star (NS). Also, the tidal disruption physics is important to determine the remnant matter post-merger, the dynamics of which could result in the counterparts. The main challenge, however, is that the binary system parameters, such as masses and spins estimated from the real-time, GW template-based searches, are often dominated by statistical and systematic errors. Here, we present an approach that uses supervised machine learning to mitigate such selection effects to report the possibility of counterparts based on the presence of an NS component, and the presence of remnant matter post-merger in real time.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...896...54C,[]
"A Search for Optical AGN Variability in 35,000 Low-mass Galaxies with the Palomar Transient Factory","We present an analysis of the long-term optical variability for ∼50,000 nearby (z < 0.055) galaxies from the NASA-Sloan Atlas, 35,000 of which are low-mass (M<SUB>*</SUB> < 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). We use difference imaging of Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) R-band observations to construct light curves with typical baselines of several years. We then search for subtle variations in the nuclear light output. We determine whether detected variability is AGN-like by assessing the fit quality to a damped random walk model. We identify 417 variability-selected AGNs, including 237 with stellar masses between 10<SUP>7</SUP> and 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. 75% of low-mass galaxies with AGN-like variability have narrow emission lines dominated by star formation. After controlling for nucleus magnitude, the fraction of variable AGNs is constant down to M<SUB>*</SUB> = 10<SUP>9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, suggesting no drastic decline in the BH occupation fraction down to this stellar mass regime. Combining our NASA-Sloan Atlas sample with samples of nearby galaxies with broad Hα emission, we find no dependence of variability properties with black hole mass. Our PTF work demonstrates the promise of long-term optical variability searches in low-mass galaxies for finding AGNs missed by other selection techniques.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...896...10B,[]
Determining Model-independent H<SUB>0</SUB> and Consistency Tests,"We determine the Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB> precisely (2.3% uncertainty) in a manner independent of the cosmological model through Gaussian process regression, using strong lensing and supernova data. Strong gravitational lensing of a variable source can provide a time-delay distance D<SUB>Δt</SUB> and angular diameter distance to the lens D<SUB>d</SUB>. These absolute distances can anchor Type Ia supernovae, which give an excellent constraint on the shape of the distance-redshift relation. Updating our previous results to use the H0LiCOW program's milestone data set consisting of six lenses, four of which have both D<SUB>Δt</SUB> and D<SUB>d</SUB> measurements, we obtain ${H}_{0}={72.8}_{-1.7}^{+1.6}\,\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\,{\mathrm{Mpc}}^{-1}$ for a flat universe and ${H}_{0}={77.3}_{-3.0}^{+2.2}\,\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\,{\mathrm{Mpc}}^{-1}$ for a non-flat universe. We carry out several consistency checks on the data and find no statistically significant tensions, though a noticeable redshift dependence persists in a particular systematic manner that we investigate. Speculating on the possibility that this trend of derived Hubble constant with lens distance is physical, we show how this can arise through modified gravity light propagation, which would also impact the weak lensing σ<SUB>8</SUB> tension.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...895L..29L,[]
Swift Monitoring of M51: A 38 day Superorbital Period for the Pulsar ULX7 and a New Transient Ultraluminous X-Ray Source,"We present the results from a monitoring campaign made with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory of the M51 galaxies, which contain several variable ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). The ongoing campaign started in 2018 May, and we report here on ∼1.5 yr of observations. The campaign, which consists of 106 observations, has a typical cadence of 3-6 days, and has the goal of determining the long-term X-ray variability of the ULXs. Two of the most variable sources were ULX7 and ULX8, both of which are known to be powered by neutron stars that are exceeding their isotropic Eddington luminosities by factors of up to 100. This is further evidence that neutron-star-powered ULXs are the most variable. Our two main results are, first, that ULX7 exhibits a periodic flux modulation with a period of 38 days varying over a magnitude and a half in flux from peak to trough. Since the orbital period of the system is known to be 2 days, the modulation is superorbital, which is a near-ubiquitous property of ULX pulsars. Second, we identify a new transient ULX, M51 XT-1, the onset of which occurred during our campaign, reaching a peak luminosity of ∼10<SUP>40</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, before gradually fading over the next ∼200 days until it slipped below the detection limit of our observations. Combined with the high-quality Swift/X-ray Telescope lightcurve of the transient, serendipitous observations made with Chandra and XMM-Newton provide insights into the onset and evolution of a likely super-Eddington event.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...895..127B,[]
A Deep CFHT Optical Search for a Counterpart to the Possible Neutron Star-Black Hole Merger GW190814,"We present a wide-field optical imaging search for electromagnetic counterparts to the likely neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) merger GW190814/S190814bv. This compact binary merger was detected through gravitational waves by the LIGO/Virgo interferometers, with masses suggestive of an NS-BH merger. We imaged the LIGO/Virgo localization region using the MegaCam instrument on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). We describe our hybrid observing strategy of both tiling and galaxy-targeted observations, as well as our image differencing and transient detection pipeline. Our observing campaign produced some of the deepest multiband images of the region between 1.7 and 8.7 days post-merger, reaching a 5σ depth of g > 22.8 (AB mag) at 1.7 days and I > 23.1 and I > 23.9 at 3.7 and 8.7 days, respectively. These observations cover a mean total integrated probability of 67.0% of the localization region. We find no compelling candidate transient counterparts to this merger in our images, which suggests that the lighter object was tidally disrupted inside of the BH's innermost stable circular orbit, the transient lies outside of the observed sky footprint, or the lighter object is a low-mass BH. We use 5σ source detection upper limits from our images in the NS-BH interpretation of this merger to constrain the mass of the kilonova ejecta to be M<SUB>ej</SUB> ≲ 0. 015M<SUB>⊙</SUB> for a ""blue"" ( $\kappa =0.5\,{\mathrm{cm}}^{2}\ {{\rm{g}}}^{-1}$ ) kilonova and M<SUB>ej</SUB> ≲ 0. 04M<SUB>⊙</SUB> for a ""red"" ( $\kappa =5\mbox{--}10\,{\mathrm{cm}}^{2}\ {{\rm{g}}}^{-1}$ ) kilonova.

Catalogue of new Herbig Ae/Be and classical Be stars. A machine learning approach to Gaia DR2,"Context. The intermediate-mass pre-main sequence Herbig Ae/Be stars are key to understanding the differences in formation mechanisms between low- and high-mass stars. The study of the general properties of these objects is hampered by the lack of a well-defined, homogeneous sample, and because few and mostly serendipitously discovered sources are known.",,[]
Aims: Our goal is to identify new Herbig Ae/Be candidates to create a homogeneous and well defined catalogue of these objects.,,,[]
"Methods: We have applied machine learning techniques to 4 150 983 sources with data from Gaia DR2, 2MASS, WISE, and IPHAS or VPHAS+. Several observables were chosen to identify new Herbig Ae/Be candidates based on our current knowledge of this class, which is characterised by infrared excesses, photometric variabilities, and Hα emission lines. Classical techniques are not efficient for identifying new Herbig Ae/Be stars mainly because of their similarity with classical Be stars, with which they share many characteristics. By focusing on disentangling these two types of objects, our algorithm has also identified new classical Be stars.",,,[]
"Results: We have obtained a large catalogue of 8470 new pre-main sequence candidates and another catalogue of 693 new classical Be candidates with a completeness of 78.8 ± 1.4% and 85.5 ± 1.2%, respectively. Of the catalogue of pre-main sequence candidates, at least 1361 sources are potentially new Herbig Ae/Be candidates according to their position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. In this study we present the methodology used, evaluate the quality of the catalogues, and perform an analysis of their flaws and biases. For this assessment, we make use of observables that have not been accounted for by the algorithm and hence are selection-independent, such as coordinates and parallax based distances. The catalogue of new Herbig Ae/Be stars that we present here increases the number of known objects of the class by an order of magnitude.",,,[]

A Real-time Automatic Validation System for Optical Transients Detected by GWAC,"The ground-based wide-angle camera array generates millions of single frame alerts per night. After the complicated and elaborate filters by multiple methods, a couple of dozens of candidates are still needed to be confirmed by follow-up observations in real-time. In order to free scientists from the complex and high-intensity follow-up tasks, we developed a Real-time Automatic transient Validation System (RAVS), and introduce here its system architecture, data processing flow, database schema, automatic follow-up control flow, and mobile message notification solution. This system is capable of automatically carrying out all operations in real-time without human intervention, including the validation of transient candidates, the adaptive light-curve sampling for identified targets in multi-band, and the pushing of observation results to the mobile client. The running of RAVS shows that an M-type stellar flare event can be well sampled by RAVS without a significant loss of the details, while the observing time is only less than one-third of the time coverage. Because the control logic of RAVS is designed to be independent of the telescope hardware, RAVS can be conveniently transplanted to other telescopes, especially the follow-up system of SVOM. Some future improvements are presented for the adaptive light-curve sampling, after taking into account both the brightness of sources and the evolution trends of the corresponding light-curves.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132e4502X,[]

Finding binary black holes in the Milky Way with LISA,"We determine the main properties of the Galactic binary black hole (BBH) population detectable by Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and strategies to distinguish them from the much more numerous white dwarf binaries. We simulate BBH populations based on cosmological simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies and binary evolution models. We then determine their gravitational wave emission as observed by LISA and build mock catalogues. According to our model, LISA will detect ≈4 (6) BBHs assuming 4 (10) yr of operations. Those figures grow to ≈6 (9) when models are re-normalized to the inferred LIGO/Virgo merger rates. Largely independent on mass and distance, sources emitting at f > 0.5 mHz - 40 per cent (70 per cent) of the detections - have a measurable frequency drift, which allows a good enough chirp mass measurement to separate them from the much lighter white dwarf and neutron star binaries. Most of the remaining, lower frequency, sources should be identifiable by their lack of electromagnetic (EM) counterpart within ≈100 pc. These results are robust with respect to the current uncertainties of the BBH merger rate as measured by LIGO/Virgo as well as the global mass spectrum of the binaries. Based on the LIGO/Virgo merger rate, we determine that there is a 94 per cent chance that LISA finds at least one of these systems within 4 yr, which will allow us to pinpoint the conditions where they were formed and possibly find unique EM signatures.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494L..75S,[]
Asteroid belt survival through stellar evolution: dependence on the stellar mass,"Polluted white dwarfs are generally accreting terrestrial-like material that may originate from a debris belt like the asteroid belt in the Solar system. The fraction of white dwarfs that are polluted drops off significantly for white dwarfs with masses $M_{\rm WD}rsim 0.8\, \rm M_\odot$ . This implies that asteroid belts and planetary systems around main-sequence (MS) stars with mass $M_{\rm MS}rsim 3\, \rm M_\odot$ may not form because of the intense radiation from the star. This is in agreement with current debris disc and exoplanet observations. The fraction of white dwarfs that show pollution also drops off significantly for low-mass white dwarfs $(M_{\rm WD}\lesssim 0.55\, \rm M_\odot)$ . However, the low-mass white dwarfs that do show pollution are not currently accreting but have accreted in the past. We suggest that asteroid belts around MS stars with masses $M_{\rm MS}\lesssim 2\, \rm M_\odot$ are not likely to survive the stellar evolution process. The destruction likely occurs during the AGB phase and could be the result of interactions of the asteroids with the stellar wind, the high radiation, or, for the lowest mass stars that have an unusually close-in asteroid belt, scattering during the tidal orbital decay of the inner planetary system.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494L..17M,[]
"On the orbital evolution of 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB>, the first asteroid ever observed to go around the Sun inside the orbit of Venus","The innermost section of the Solar system has not been extensively studied because minor bodies moving inside Earth's orbit tend to spend most of their sidereal orbital periods at very low solar elongation, well away from the areas more frequently observed by programs searching for near-Earth objects. The survey carried out from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is the first one that has been able to detect multiple asteroids well detached from the direct gravitational perturbation of the Earth-Moon system. ZTF discoveries include 2019 AQ<SUB>3</SUB> and 2019 LF<SUB>6</SUB>, two Atiras with the shortest periods among known asteroids. Here, we perform an assessment of the orbital evolution of 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB>, an Atira found by ZTF with a similarly short period but following a path contained entirely within the orbit of Venus. This property makes it the first known member of the elusive Vatira population. Genuine Vatiras, those long-term dynamically stable, are thought to be subjected to the so-called von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillation that protects them against close encounters with both Mercury and Venus. However, 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB> appears to be a former Atira that entered the Vatira orbital domain relatively recently. It displays an anticoupled oscillation of the values of eccentricity and inclination, but the value of the argument of perihelion may circulate. Simulations show that 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB> might reach a 3:2 resonant orbit with Venus in the future, activating the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism, which in turn opens the possibility to the existence of a long-term stable population of Vatiras trapped in this configuration.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494L...6D,[]
A Volume-limited Sample of Cataclysmic Variables from Gaia DR2: Space Density and Population Properties,"We present the first volume-limited sample of cataclysmic variables (CVs), selected using the accurate parallaxes provided by the second data release (DR2) of the European Space Agency Gaia space mission. The sample is composed of 42 CVs within 150 pc, including two new systems discovered using the Gaia data, and is $(77 \pm 10)$ per cent complete. We use this sample to study the intrinsic properties of the Galactic CV population. In particular, the CV space density we derive, $\rho =(4.8^{+0.6}_{-0.8}) \times 10^{-6}\, \mbox{$\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$}$, is lower than that predicted by most binary population synthesis studies. We also find a low fraction of period bounce CVs, seven per cent, and an average white dwarf mass of $\langle M_\mathrm{WD} \rangle = (0.83 \pm 0.17)\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ . Both findings confirm previous results, ruling out the presence of observational biases affecting these measurements, as has been suggested in the past. The observed fraction of period bounce CVs falls well below theoretical predictions, by at least a factor of five, and remains one of the open problems in the current understanding of CV evolution. Conversely, the average white dwarf mass supports the presence of additional mechanisms of angular momentum loss that have been accounted for in the latest evolutionary models. The fraction of magnetic CVs in the 150 pc sample is remarkably high at 36 per cent. This is in striking contrast with the absence of magnetic white dwarfs in the detached population of CV progenitors, and underlines that the evolution of magnetic systems has to be included in the next generation of population models.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494.3799P,[]
Near-infrared variability in dusty white dwarfs: tracing the accretion of planetary material,"The inwards scattering of planetesimals towards white dwarfs is expected to be a stochastic process with variability on human time-scales. The planetesimals tidally disrupt at the Roche radius, producing dusty debris detectable as excess infrared emission. When sufficiently close to the white dwarf, this debris sublimates and accretes on to the white dwarf and pollutes its atmosphere. Studying this infrared emission around polluted white dwarfs can reveal how this planetary material arrives in their atmospheres. We report a near-infrared monitoring campaign of 34 white dwarfs with infrared excesses with the aim to search for variability in the dust emission. Time series photometry of these white dwarfs from the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (Wide Field Camera) in the J-, H-, and K-bands was obtained over baselines of up to 3 yr. We find no statistically significant variation in the dust emission in all three near-infrared bands. Specifically, we can rule out variability at ∼1.3 per cent for the 13 white dwarfs brighter than 16th mag in K-band, and at ∼10 per cent for the 32 white dwarfs brighter than 18th mag over time-scales of 3 yr. Although to date two white dwarfs, SDSS J095904.69-020047.6 and WD 1226+110, have shown K-band variability, in our sample we see no evidence of new K-band variability at these levels. One interpretation is that the tidal disruption events that lead to large variabilities are rare occur on short time-scales, and after a few years the white dwarfs return to being stable in the near-infrared.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494.2861R,[]
Generating metal-polluting debris in white dwarf planetary systems from small-impact crater ejecta,"Metal pollution in white dwarf photospheres originates from the accretion of some combination of planets, moons, asteroids, comets, boulders, pebbles, and dust. When large bodies reside in dynamically stagnant locations - unable themselves to pollute or even closely approach the white dwarf - then smaller reservoirs of impact debris may become a complementary or the primary source of metal pollutants. Here, we take a first step towards exploring this possibility by computing limits on the recoil mass that escapes the gravitational pull of the target object following a single impact onto an atmosphere-less surface. By considering vertical impacts only with the full-chain analytical prescription from Kurosawa & Takada, we provide lower bounds for the ejected mass for basalt, granite, iron, and water-rich target objects across the radii range 10<SUP>0</SUP>-10<SUP>3</SUP> km. Our use of the full-chain prescription as opposed to physical experiments or hydrocode simulations allows us to quickly sample a wide range of parameter space appropriate to white dwarf planetary systems. Our numerical results could be used in future studies to constrain freshly generated small debris reservoirs around white dwarfs given a particular planetary system architecture, bombardment history, and impact geometries.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494..442V,[]
An Extension of the Athena++ Framework for General Equations of State,"We present modifications to the Athena++ framework to enable the use of general equations of state (EOS). A part of our motivation for doing so is to model transient astrophysics phenomena, as these types of events are often not well approximated by an ideal gas. This necessitated changes to the Riemann solvers implemented in Athena++. We discuss the adjustments made to the Harten-Lax-van Leer-Contact and Harten-Lax-van Leer-Discontinuities solvers and EOS calls required for arbitrary EOS. We demonstrate the reliability of our code in a number of tests that utilize a relatively simple, but nontrivial, EOS based on hydrogen ionization, appropriate for the transition from atomic to ionized hydrogen. Additionally, we perform tests using an electron-positron Helmholtz EOS, appropriate for regimes where nuclear statistical equilibrium is a good approximation. These new complex EOS tests overall show that our modifications to Athena++ accurately solve the Riemann problem with linear convergence and linear wave tests with quadratic convergence. We provide our test solutions as a means to check the accuracy of other hydrodynamic codes. Our tests and additions to Athena++ will enable further research into (magneto)hydrodynamic problems where realistic treatments of the EOS are required.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJS..248....7C,[]
"A Mildly Relativistic Outflow from the Energetic, Fast-rising Blue Optical Transient CSS161010 in a Dwarf Galaxy","We present X-ray and radio observations of the Fast Blue Optical Transient CRTS-CSS161010 J045834-081803 (CSS161010 hereafter) at t = 69-531 days. CSS161010 shows luminous X-ray (L<SUB>X</SUB> ∼ 5 × 10<SUP>39</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) and radio (L<SUB>ν</SUB> ∼ 10<SUP>29</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> Hz<SUP>-1</SUP>) emission. The radio emission peaked at ∼100 days post-transient explosion and rapidly decayed. We interpret these observations in the context of synchrotron emission from an expanding blast wave. CSS161010 launched a mildly relativistic outflow with velocity Γβc ≥ 0.55c at ∼100 days. This is faster than the non-relativistic AT 2018cow (Γβc ∼ 0.1c) and closer to ZTF18abvkwla (Γβc ≥ 0.3c at 63 days). The inferred initial kinetic energy of CSS161010 (E<SUB>k</SUB> ≳ 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg) is comparable to that of long gamma-ray bursts, but the ejecta mass that is coupled to the mildly relativistic outflow is significantly larger ( $\sim 0.01\mbox{--}0.1\,{M}_{\odot }$ ). This is consistent with the lack of observed γ-rays. The luminous X-rays were produced by a different emission component to the synchrotron radio emission. CSS161010 is located at ∼150 Mpc in a dwarf galaxy with stellar mass M<SUB>*</SUB> ∼ 10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and specific star formation rate sSFR ∼ 0.3 Gyr<SUP>-1</SUP>. This mass is among the lowest inferred for host galaxies of explosive transients from massive stars. Our observations of CSS161010 are consistent with an engine-driven aspherical explosion from a rare evolutionary path of a H-rich stellar progenitor, but we cannot rule out a stellar tidal disruption event on a centrally located intermediate-mass black hole. Regardless of the physical mechanism, CSS161010 establishes the existence of a new class of rare (rate < 0.4% of the local core-collapse supernova rate) H-rich transients that can launch mildly relativistic outflows.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...895L..23C,[]
"The Rotation Curve, Mass Distribution, and Dark Matter Content of the Milky Way from Classical Cepheids","With the increasing number of large stellar survey projects, the quality and quantity of excellent tracers for studying the Milky Way are rapidly growing, one of which is the classical Cepheids. Classical Cepheids are high-precision standard candles with very low typical uncertainties (<3%) available via the mid-infrared period-luminosity relation. About 3500 classical Cepheids identified from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernova, Gaia, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, and Zwicky Transient Facility survey data have been analyzed in this work, and their spatial distributions show a clear signature of Galactic warp. Two kinematical methods are adopted to measure the Galactic rotation curve (RC) in the Galactocentric distance range of $4\lesssim {R}_{\mathrm{GC}}\lesssim 19\,\mathrm{kpc}$ . Gently declining RCs are derived by both the proper motion (PM) method and three-dimensional velocity vector (3DV) method. The largest sample of classical Cepheids with the most accurate 6D phase-space coordinates available to date are modeled in the 3DV method, and the resulting RC is found to decline at the relatively smaller gradient of (-1.33 ± 0.1) $\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\,{\mathrm{kpc}}^{-1}$ . Comparing to results from the PM method, a higher rotation velocity ((232.5 ± 0.83) $\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ ) is derived at the position of the Sun in the 3DV method.

Using the color-stretch parameters, s<SUB>BV</SUB> or s<SUB>gr</SUB>, and the time of I-band primary maximum relative to the B-band ( ${t}_{\max }^{I-B}$ ) or g-band ( ${t}_{\max }^{I-g}$ ) maximum it is demonstrated that 2003fg-like, 1991bg-like, and 2002cx-like SNe Ia can be identified readily. In the cases of these extreme SNe Ia, their primary I-band maximum occurs after the time of the B- or g-band maxima. We suggest that the timing of the I-band maximum can reveal the physical state of the SN Ia explosion as it traces: (I) the speed of the recombination front of iron group elements in the ejecta, (II) the temperature evolution and rate of adiabatic cooling in the ejecta and, (III) the presence of interaction with a stellar envelope. This photometric sub-typing can be used in conjunction with other SNe analysis, such as the Branch diagram, to examine the physics and diversity of SNe Ia. The results here can also be used to screen out non-Ia SNe from cosmological samples that do not have complete spectroscopic typing. Finally, as future surveys like that of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (previously referred to as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope) create large databases of light curves of many objects this photometric identification can be used to readily identify and study the rates and bulk properties of peculiar SNe Ia.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...895L...3A,[]
The Koala: A Fast Blue Optical Transient with Luminous Radio Emission from a Starburst Dwarf Galaxy at z = 0.27,"We present ZTF18abvkwla (the ""Koala""), a fast blue optical transient discovered in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) One-Day Cadence (1DC) Survey. ZTF18abvkwla has a number of features in common with the groundbreaking transient AT 2018cow: blue colors at peak ( $g-r\approx -0.5$ mag), a short rise time from half-max of under two days, a decay time to half-max of only three days, a high optical luminosity ( ${M}_{g,\mathrm{peak}}\approx -20.6$ mag), a hot (≳40,000 K) featureless spectrum at peak light, and a luminous radio counterpart. At late times ( ${\rm{\Delta }}t 80\,\mathrm{days}$ ), the radio luminosity of ZTF18abvkwla ( $\nu {L}_{\nu }rsim {10}^{40}\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ at 10 $\mathrm{GHz}$ , observer-frame) is most similar to that of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The host galaxy is a dwarf starburst galaxy ( $M\approx 5\times {10}^{8}\,{M}_{\odot }$ , $\mathrm{SFR}\approx 7\,{M}_{\odot }\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$ ) that is moderately metal-enriched ( $\mathrm{log}[{\rm{O}}/{\rm{H}}]\approx 8.5$ ), similar to the hosts of GRBs and superluminous supernovae. As in AT2018cow, the radio and optical emission in ZTF18abvkwla likely arise from two separate components: the radio from fast-moving ejecta ( ${\rm{\Gamma }}\beta c 0.38c$ ) and the optical from shock-interaction with confined dense material (<0.07 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> in $\sim {10}^{15}\,\mathrm{cm}$ ). Compiling transients in the literature with ${t}_{\mathrm{rise}} 5\,\mathrm{days}$ and ${M}_{\mathrm{peak}} -20$ mag, we find that a significant number are engine-powered, and suggest that the high peak optical luminosity is directly related to the presence of this engine. From 18 months of the 1DC survey, we find that transients in this rise-luminosity phase space are at least two to three orders of magnitude less common than CC SNe. Finally, we discuss strategies for identifying such events with future facilities like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, as well as prospects for detecting accompanying X-ray and radio emission.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...895...49H,[]
Evaluation of Automated Fermi GBM Localizations of Gamma-Ray Bursts,"The capability of the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) to localize gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is evaluated for two different automated algorithms: the GBM Team's RoboBA algorithm and the independently developed BALROG algorithm. Through a systematic study utilizing over 500 GRBs with known locations from instruments like Swift and the Fermi Large Area Telescope, we directly compare the effectiveness of, and accurately estimate the systematic uncertainty for, both algorithms. We show that simple adjustments to the GBM Team's RoboBA, in operation since early 2016, yield significant improvement in the systematic uncertainty, removing the long tail identified in the systematic, and improve the overall accuracy. The systematic uncertainty for the updated RoboBA localizations is 1°8 for 52% of GRBs and 4°1 for the remaining 48%. Both from public reporting by BALROG and our systematic study, we find the systematic uncertainty of 1°-2° quoted in circulars for bright GRBs is an underestimate of the true magnitude of the systematic, which we find to be 2°7 for 74% of GRBs and 33° for the remaining 26%. We show that, once the systematic uncertainty is considered, the RoboBA 90% localization confidence regions can be more than an order of magnitude smaller in area than those produced by BALROG.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...895...40G,[]
The Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey. I. Spectroscopic Classification and the Redshift Completeness of Local Galaxy Catalogs,"The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is performing a three-day cadence survey of the visible northern sky (∼3π) with newly found transient candidates announced via public alerts. The ZTF Bright Transient Survey (BTS) is a large spectroscopic campaign to complement the photometric survey. BTS endeavors to spectroscopically classify all extragalactic transients with m<SUB>peak</SUB> ≤ 18.5 mag in either the g<SUB>ZTF</SUB> or r<SUB>ZTF</SUB> filters, and publicly announce said classifications. BTS discoveries are predominantly supernovae (SNe), making this the largest flux-limited SN survey to date. Here we present a catalog of 761 SNe, classified during the first nine months of ZTF (2018 April 1-2018 December 31). We report BTS SN redshifts from SN template matching and spectroscopic host-galaxy redshifts when available. We analyze the redshift completeness of local galaxy catalogs, the redshift completeness fraction (RCF; the ratio of SN host galaxies with known spectroscopic redshift prior to SN discovery to the total number of SN hosts). Of the 512 host galaxies with SNe Ia, 227 had previously known spectroscopic redshifts, yielding an RCF estimate of 44% ± 4%. The RCF decreases with increasing distance and decreasing galaxy luminosity (for z < 0.05, or ∼200 Mpc, RCF ≈ 0.6). Prospects for dramatically increasing the RCF are limited to new multifiber spectroscopic instruments or wide-field narrowband surveys. Existing galaxy redshift catalogs are only ∼50% complete at r ≈ 16.9 mag. Pushing this limit several magnitudes deeper will pay huge dividends when searching for electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events or sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays or neutrinos.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...895...32F,[]
Examining a Peak-luminosity/Decline-rate Relationship for Tidal Disruption Events,"We compare the luminosity, radius, and temperature evolution of the UV/optical blackbodies for 21 well-observed tidal disruption events (TDEs), 8 of which were discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae. We find that the blackbody radii generally increase prior to peak and slowly decline at late times. The blackbody temperature evolution is generally flat, with a few objects showing small-scale variations. The bolometric UV/optical luminosities generally evolve smoothly and flatten out at late times. Finally, we find an apparent correlation between the peak luminosity and the decline rate of TDEs. This relationship is strongest when comparing the peak luminosity to its decline over 40 days. A linear fit yields ${\mathrm{log}}_{10}({L}_{\mathrm{peak}})$ = $({44.1}_{-0.1}^{+0.1})$ + $({1.6}_{-0.2}^{+0.4})({\rm{\Delta }}{L}_{40}+0.5)$ in cgs, where ${\rm{\Delta }}{L}_{40}={\mathrm{log}}_{10}({L}_{40}/{L}_{\mathrm{peak}})$.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...894L..10H,[]
"The Gravitational Wave Treasure Map: A Tool to Coordinate, Visualize, and Assess the Electromagnetic Follow-up of Gravitational-wave Events","We present the Gravitational Wave (GW) Treasure Map, a tool to coordinate, visualize, and assess the electromagnetic (EM) followup of GW events. With typical GW localization regions of hundreds to thousands of square degrees and dozens of active follow-up groups, the pursuit of EM counterparts is a challenging endeavor, but the scientific payoff for early discovery of any counterpart is clear. With this tool, we provide a website and an application programming interface (API) that allows users to easily see where other groups have searched and better inform their own follow-up search efforts. A strong community of Treasure Map users will increase the overall efficiency of EM counterpart searches and will play a fundamental role in the future of multimessenger astronomy.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...894..127W,[]
The ELM Survey South. I. An Effective Search for Extremely Low Mass White Dwarfs,"We begin the search for extremely low mass (M ≤ 0.3M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, ELM) white dwarfs (WDs) in the southern sky based on photometry from the VST ATLAS and SkyMapper surveys. We use a similar color selection method as the Hypervelocity star survey. We switched to an astrometric selection once Gaia Data Release 2 became available. We use the previously known sample of ELM white dwarfs to demonstrate that these objects occupy a unique parameter space in parallax and magnitude. We use the SOAR 4.1 m telescope to test the Gaia-based selection, and identify more than two dozen low mass white dwarfs, including six new ELM white dwarf binaries with periods as short as 2 h. The better efficiency of the Gaia-based selection enables us to extend the ELM Survey footprint to the southern sky. We confirm one of our candidates, J0500-0930, to be the brightest (G = 12.6 mag) and closest (d = 72 pc) ELM white dwarf binary currently known. Remarkably, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) full-frame imaging data on this system reveals low-level (<0.1%) but significant variability at the orbital period of this system (P = 9.5 hr), likely from the relativistic beaming effect. TESS data on another system, J0642-5605, reveals ellipsoidal variations due to a tidally distorted ELM WD. These demonstrate the power of TESS full-frame images in confirming the orbital periods of relatively bright compact object binaries.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...894...53K,[]
Improving the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram with the Thomson Multitaper,"A common approach for characterizing the properties of time-series data that are evenly sampled in time is to estimate the power spectrum of the data using the periodogram. The periodogram as an estimator of the spectrum is (1) statistically inconsistent (i.e., its variance does not go to zero as infinite data are collected), (2) biased for finite samples, and (3) suffers from spectral leakage. In astronomy, time-series data are often unevenly sampled in time, and it is popular to use the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram to estimate the spectrum. Unfortunately, from a statistical standpoint, the LS periodogram suffers from the same issues as the classical periodogram and has even worse spectral leakage. Here, we present an improvement on the LS periodogram by combining it with the Thomson multitaper approach. The multitaper spectral estimator is well established in the statistics and engineering literature for evenly sampled time series. It is attractive because it directly trades off bias and variance for frequency resolution, and is fast to compute: compared to an untapered spectral estimator, the multitaper adds no more than a couple of seconds for a time series with a million data points on a current desktop computer. Here, we describe an estimator that combines the multitaper with the LS periodogram. We show examples in which this new approach has improved properties compared to traditional approaches in the case of unevenly sampled time series. Finally, we demonstrate an application of the method to astronomy with an application to Kepler data.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....159..205S,[]
Cataclysmic Variables in the First Year of the Zwicky Transient Facility,"Using selection criteria based on amplitude, time, and color, we have identified 329 objects as known or candidate cataclysmic variables (CVs) during the first year of testing and operation of the Zwicky Transient Facility. Of these, 90 are previously confirmed CVs, 218 are strong candidates based on the shape and color of their light curves obtained during 3-562 days of observation, and the remaining 21 are possible CVs but with too few data points to be listed as good candidates. Almost half of the strong candidates are within 10 deg of the galactic plane, in contrast to most other large surveys that have avoided crowded fields. The available Gaia parallaxes are consistent with sampling the low mass transfer CVs, as predicted by population models. Our follow-up spectra have confirmed Balmer/helium emission lines in 27 objects, with four showing high-excitation He II emission, including candidates for an AM CVn, a polar, and an intermediate polar. Our results demonstrate that a complete survey of the Galactic plane is needed to accomplish an accurate determination of the number of CVs existing in the Milky Way.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....159..198S,[]
Subsequent outbursts of the same EXor source possibly present similar features,"Context. V1118 Ori is a classical EXor source whose light curve has been monitored, although not continuously, over the past 30 years. This source underwent a powerful outburst in 2005, followed by 10 years of quiescence and a less intense outburst in 2015. In 2019, a new intense brightness increase was observed (Δg ∼ 3 mag).",,[]
Aims: This new accretion episode offers the opportunity to compare the photometric and spectroscopic properties of multiple outbursts of the same source. This allows us to highlight the differences and similarities among various events by removing any possible bias related to the intrinsic properties of the star-disk system.,,,[]
Methods: We discovered the 2019 V1118 Ori outburst by examining the g-band light curve acquired by the Zwicky Transient Facility and followed the declining phase with the Rapid Eye Mount telescope in the griz bands. Two near-infrared spectra were also acquired at different brightness stages with the Large Binocular Telescope.,,,[]
"Results: The last event shows the following characteristics: (1) an amplitude similar to that of 2015 and lower than that of 2005; (2) a duration of less than one year as in previous events; (3) a increasing (decreasing) speed of 0.018 (0.031) mag day<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is different from previous cases; (4) a gradually blueing of the [g - r] color is observed over time, while the [r - i] color remains roughly unchanged; (5) with few exceptions, the near-infrared lines (mainly H I recombination) are the same as those observed in 2015; and (6) the mass accretion rate peaks at Ṁ<SUB>acc</SUB> ∼ 10<SUP>-7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> and decreases in about a month down to a few 10<SUP>-8</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>.",,,[]

Identification of 3XMM J000511.8+634018 as a new polar at P<SUB>orb</SUB> = 133.5 min - is it inside or outside the period gap?,,,[]
"Aims: We aimed to identify the variable X-ray source 3XMM J000511.8+634018, which was serendipitously discovered through routine inspections while the 3XMM catalogue was compiled.",,,[]
"Methods: We analysed the archival XMM-Newton observation of the source, obtained BUSCA photometry in three colours, and performed optical spectroscopy with the LBT. These data were supplemented by archival observations from the Zwicky Transient Facility.",,,[]
"Results: Based on its optical and X-ray properties, 3XMM J000511.8+634018 is classified as a magnetic cataclysmic variable, or polar. The flux is modulated with a period of 2.22 h (8009.1 ± 0.2 s), which we identify with the orbital period. The bright phases are highly variable in X-ray luminosity from one cycle to the next. The source shows a thermal plasma spectrum typical of polars without evidence of a luminous soft blackbody-like component. It is non-eclipsing and displays one-pole accretion. The X-ray and BUSCA light curves show a stream absorption dip, which suggests an inclination 50° < i < 75°. The phasing of this feature, which occurs at the end of the bright phase, requires a somewhat special accretion geometry with a stream running far around the white dwarf before it is magnetically channelled. The period of this polar falls within the period gap of the cataclysmic variables (2.15-3.18 h), but appears to fall just below the minimum period when only polars are considered.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A&A...637A..35S,,[]
AT 2019abn: multi-wavelength observations over the first 200 days,Context. AT 2019abn was discovered in the nearby M51 galaxy by the Zwicky Transient Facility at more than two magnitudes and around three weeks prior to its optical peak.,,[]
"Aims: We aim to conduct a detailed photometric and spectroscopic follow-up campaign for AT 2019abn, with early discovery allowing for significant pre-maximum observations of an intermediate luminosity red transient (ILRT) for the first time.",,,[]
"Methods: This work is based on the analysis of u'BVr'i'z'H photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy using the Liverpool Telescope, medium-resolution spectroscopy with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), and near-infrared imaging with the GTC and the Nordic Optical Telescope.",,,[]
"Results: We present the most detailed optical light curve of an ILRT to date, with multi-band photometry starting around three weeks before peak brightness. The transient peaked at an observed absolute magnitude of M<SUB>r'</SUB> = -13.1, although it is subject to significant reddening from dust in M51, implying an intrinsic M<SUB>r'</SUB> ∼ -15.2. The initial light curve showed a linear, achromatic rise in magnitude before becoming bluer at peak. After peak brightness, the transient gradually cooled. This is reflected in our spectra, which at later times show absorption from such species as Fe I, Ni I and Li I. A spectrum taken around peak brightness shows narrow, low-velocity absorption lines, which we interpret as likely to originate from pre-existing circumstellar material.",,,[]
"Conclusions: We conclude that while there are some peculiarities, such as the radius evolution, AT 2019abn fits in well overall with the ILRT class of objects and is the most luminous member of the class seen to date.",,,[]

DX Cygni: A triple system with mass transfer,"A dozen of new precise times of eclipses were measured for the eclipsing binary DX Cygni as a part of our long-term observational project for studying neglected eclipsing binaries with a short orbital period. Based on a current O - C diagram, we found for the first time that its period is increasing (dP / P = 1.68 ×10<SUP>-7</SUP> day/years) and that times of minima show also significant cyclical changes with a period of about 16 years, caused very probably by a third body orbiting the eclipsing pair. The minimal mass of this companion is 0.49 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The light curve solution in PHOEBE results to the typical Algol-type semidetached configuration where the secondary fills its Roche lobe. The temperature of primary component was fixed to T<SUB>1</SUB> = 5300 K according to its spectral type, which gives us T<SUB>2</SUB> = 3330 ± 20 K for the secondary.

Direct evidence for shock-powered optical emission in a nova,"Classical novae are thermonuclear explosions that occur on the surfaces of white dwarf stars in interacting binary systems<SUP>1</SUP>. It has long been thought that the luminosity of classical novae is powered by continued nuclear burning on the surface of the white dwarf after the initial runaway<SUP>2</SUP>. However, recent observations of gigaelectronvolt γ-rays from classical novae have hinted that shocks internal to the nova ejecta may dominate the nova emission. Shocks have also been suggested to power the luminosity of events as diverse as stellar mergers<SUP>3</SUP>, supernovae<SUP>4</SUP> and tidal disruption events<SUP>5</SUP>, but observational confirmation has been lacking. Here we report simultaneous space-based optical and γ-ray observations of the 2018 nova V906 Carinae (ASASSN-18fv), revealing a remarkable series of distinct correlated flares in both bands. The optical and γ-ray flares occur simultaneously, implying a common origin in shocks. During the flares, the nova luminosity doubles, implying that the bulk of the luminosity is shock powered. Furthermore, we detect concurrent but weak X-ray emission from deeply embedded shocks, confirming that the shock power does not appear in the X-ray band and supporting its emergence at longer wavelengths. Our data, spanning the spectrum from radio to γ-ray, provide direct evidence that shocks can power substantial luminosity in classical novae and other optical transients.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020NatAs...4..776A,[]

First discovery of an ultra-cool white dwarf benchmark in common proper motion with an M dwarf,"Ultra-cool white dwarfs are among the oldest stellar remnants in the Universe. Their efficient gravitational settling and low effective temperatures are responsible for the smooth spectra they exhibit. For that reason, it is not possible to derive their radial velocities or to find the chemistry of the progenitors. The best that can be done is to infer such properties from associated sources, which are coeval. The simplest form of such a system is a common proper motion pair where one star is an evolved degenerate and the other a main-sequence star. In this work, we present the discovery of the first of such a system, the M dwarf LHS 6328 and the ultra-cool white dwarf PSO J1801+625, from the Pan-STARRS 1 3π survey and the Gaia Data Release 2. Follow-up spectra were collected covering a usable wavelength range of 3750-24 500 Å. Their spectra show that the white dwarf has an effective temperature of 3550 K and surface gravity of log g = 7.45 ± 0.13 or log g = 7.49 ± 0.13 for a CO or He core, respectively, when compared against synthetic spectra of ultra-cool white dwarf atmosphere models. The system has slightly subsolar metallicity with -0.25 < [Fe/H] < 0.0, and a spatial velocity of (U, V, W) = (-114.26 ± 0.24, 222.94 ± 0.60, 10.25 ± 0.34) km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, the first radial velocity and metallicity measurements of an ultra-cool white dwarf.

Detection of gamma-ray transients with wild binary segmentation,"In the context of time domain astronomy, we present an offline detection search of gamma-ray transients using a wild binary segmentation analysis called F-WBSB targeting both short and long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and covering the soft and hard gamma-ray bands. We use NASA Fermi/GBM archival data as a training and testing data set. This paper describes the analysis applied to the 12 NaI detectors of the Fermi/GBM instrument. This includes background removal, change-point detection that brackets the peaks of gamma-ray flares, the evaluation of significance for each individual GBM detector, and the combination of the results among the detectors. We also explain the calibration of the ∼ 10 parameters present in the method using one week of archival data. Finally, we present our detection performance result for 60 d of a blind search analysis with F-WBSB by comparing to both the onboard and offline GBM search as well as external events found by others surveys such as Swift-BAT. We detect 42/44 onboard GBM events but also other gamma-ray flares at a rate of 1 per hour in the 4-50 keV band. Our results show that F-WBSB is capable of recovering gamma-ray flares, including the detection of soft X-ray long transients. FWBSB offers an independent identification of GRBs in combination with methods for determining spectral and temporal properties of the transient as well as localization. This is particularly useful for increasing the GRB rate and that will help the joint detection with gravitational-wave events.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493.4428A,[]
Faint rapid red transients from neutron star-CO white dwarf mergers,"Mergers of neutron stars (NS) and white dwarfs (WD) may give rise to observable explosive transient events. We use 3D hydrodynamical (smoothed particle hydrodynamics - SPH) simulations and 2D hydrodynamical-thermonuclear simulations (using the FLASH adaptive mesh refinement code) to model the disruption of CO-WDs by NSs, which produce faint transient events. We post-process the simulations using a large nuclear network and make use of the SUPERNU radiation transfer code to predict the observational signatures and detailed properties of these transients. We calculate the light curves and spectra for five models of NS-CO-WD mergers. The small yields of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni (few × 10^{-3} {M_{⊙ }}) result in faint, rapidly evolving reddened transients (RRTs) with B(R) peak magnitudes of at most ∼-12 (-13) to ∼-13 (-15), much shorter and fainter than both regular and faint/peculiar Type Ia supernovae. These transients are likely to be accompanied by several months long, 1-2 mag dimmer red/infrared afterglows. We show that the spectra of RRTs share some similarities with rapidly evolving transients such as SN 2010X, although RRTs are significantly fainter, especially in the I/R bands, and show far stronger Si lines. We estimate that the upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope could detect RRTs at a rate of up to ∼10-70 yr<SUP>-1</SUP> through observations in the R/I bands. The qualitative agreement between the SPH and FLASH approaches supports the earlier hydrodynamical studies of these systems.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493.3956Z,[]
Variability and transient search in the SUDARE-VOICE field: a new method to extract the light curves,"The VLT Survey Telescope (VST) Optical Imaging of the CDFS and ES1 Fields Survey, in synergy with the SUDARE survey, is a deep optical ugri imaging of the CDFS and ES1 fields using the VST. The observations for the CDFS field comprise about 4.38 deg<SUP>2</SUP> down to r ∼ 26 mag. The total on-sky time spans over 4 yr in this field, distributed over four adjacent sub-fields. In this paper, we use the multiepoch r-band imaging data to measure the variability of the detected objects and search for transients. We perform careful astrometric and photometric calibrations and point spread function modelling. A new method, referring to as differential running-average photometry, is proposed to measure the light curves of the detected objects. With the method, the difference of PSFs between different epochs can be reduced, and the background fluctuations are also suppressed. Detailed uncertainty analysis and detrending corrections on the light curves are performed. We visually inspect the light curves to select variable objects, and present some objects with interesting light curves. Further investigation of these objects in combination with multiband data will be presented in our forthcoming paper.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493.3825L,[]
Search for Evolutionary Changes in the Period the Cepheid ET Vul,"The reduction of all the available photometry for the Cepheid ET Vul has allowed its $O-C$ diagram spanning a time interval of 130 years to be constructed.

Physical Parameters of Late-type Contact Binaries in the Northern Catalina Sky Survey,"We present the physical parameters of 2335 late-type contact binary (CB) systems extracted from the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS). Our sample was selected from the CSS Data Release 1 by strictly limiting the prevailing temperature uncertainties and light-curve fitting residuals, allowing us to almost eliminate any possible contaminants. We developed an automatic Wilson-Devinney-type code to derive the relative properties of CBs based on their light-curve morphology. By adopting the distances derived from CB (orbital) period-luminosity relations (PLRs), combined with the well-defined mass-luminosity relation for the systems' primary stars and assuming solar metallicity, we calculated the objects' masses, radii, and luminosities. Our sample of fully eclipsing CBs contains 1530 W-, 710 A-, and 95 B-type CBs. A comparison with literature data and with the results from different surveys confirms the accuracy and coherence of our measurements. The period distributions of the various CB subtypes are different, hinting at a possible evolutionary sequence. W-type CBs are clearly located in a strip in the total mass versus mass-ratio plane, while A-type CBs may exhibit a slightly different dependence. There are no significant differences among the PLRs of A- and W-type CBs, but the PLR zero-points are affected by their mass ratios and fill-out factors. Determination of zero-point differences for different types of CBs may help us improve the accuracy of the resulting PLRs. We demonstrate that automated approaches to deriving CB properties could be a powerful tool for application to the much larger CB samples expected to result from future surveys.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJS..247...50S,[]
Necroplanetology: Simulating the Tidal Disruption of Differentiated Planetary Material Orbiting WD 1145+017,"The WD 1145+017 system shows irregular transit features that are consistent with the tidal disruption of differentiated asteroids with bulk densities $ 4\,{\rm{g}}\,{\mathrm{cm}}^{-3}$ and bulk masses $\lesssim {10}^{21}\,\mathrm{kg}$ . We use the open-source N-body code REBOUND to simulate this disruption with different internal structures: varying the core volume fraction, mantle/core density ratio, and the presence/absence of a thin low-density crust. We allow the rubble pile to partially disrupt and capture lightcurves at a specific point during the disruption at cadences comparable to those from ground-based photometry. As a proof-of-concept we show that varying these structural parameters have observationally distinguishable effects on the transit lightcurve as the asteroid is disrupted and compare the simulation-generated lightcurves to data from Gary et al. With the caveat that our simulations do not model the sublimation in detail or account for its effects on orbital evolution, we find that a low core fraction and low mantle/core density ratio asteroid is most consistent with the stable transit feature present for multiple weeks circa 2016 April (referred to as G6121 in Gary et al. and A1 in Hallakoun et al.). Connecting tidal disruption simulations to photometry suggests characteristics for the interior structure and composition of an exoplanetary body, information that is only possible because we are observing the death of the planetary system in action. All-sky survey missions such as TESS and LSST will be able to detect other systems like WD 1145+017, creating a sample of subjects for a new subfield of planetary science: necroplanetology.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893..166D,[]
Constraint on the Ejecta Mass for Black Hole-Neutron Star Merger Event Candidate S190814bv,"We derive the upper limit to the ejecta mass of S190814bv, a black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) merger candidate, through radiative transfer simulations for kilonovae with realistic ejecta density profiles, as well as detailed opacity and heating rate models. The limits to the ejecta mass strongly depend on the viewing angle. For the face-on observations (≤45°), the total ejecta mass should be smaller than 0.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> for the average distance of S190814bv (D = 267 Mpc), while a larger mass is allowed for the edge-on observations. We also derive the conservative upper limits of the dynamical ejecta mass to be 0.02, 0.03, and 0.05 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> for the viewing angles ≤20°, ≤50°, and ≤90°, respectively. We show that an iz-band observation deeper than 22 mag within 2 days after the gravitational-wave trigger is crucial to detect a kilonova with a total ejecta mass of 0.06 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> at a distance of D = 300 Mpc. We also show that a strong constraint on the NS mass-radius relation can be obtained if future observations put an upper limit of 0.03 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> on the dynamical ejecta mass for a BH-NS event with a chirp mass smaller than ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and effective spin larger than ≳0.5.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893..153K,[]
SN 2019ein: New Insights into the Similarities and Diversity among High-velocity Type Ia Supernovae,"We present optical observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN) 2019ein, starting two days after the estimated explosion date. The spectra and light curves show that SN 2019ein belongs to a high-velocity (HV) and broad-line group with a relatively rapid decline in the light curves (Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(B) = 1.36 ± 0.02 mag) and a short rise time (15.37 ± 0.55 days). The Si II λ6355 velocity, associated with a photospheric component but not with a detached high-velocity feature, reached ∼20,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> 12 days before the B-band maximum. The line velocity, however, decreased very rapidly and smoothly toward maximum light, to ∼13,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is relatively low among HV SNe. This indicates that the speed of the spectral evolution of HV SNe Ia is correlated with not only the velocity at maximum light, but also the light-curve decline rate, as is the case for normal-velocity (NV) SNe Ia. Spectral synthesis modeling shows that the outermost layer at >17,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> is well described by an O-Ne-C burning layer extending to at least 25,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, and there is no unburnt carbon below 30,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>; these properties are largely consistent with the delayed detonation scenario and are shared with the prototypical HV SN 2002bo despite the large difference in Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(B). This structure is strikingly different from that derived for the well-studied NV SN 2011fe. We suggest that the relation between the mass of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni (or Δm<SUB>15</SUB>) and the extent of the O-Ne-C burning layer provides an important constraint on the explosion mechanism(s) of HV and NV SNe.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893..143K,[]
The Broad-lined Ic Supernova ZTF18aaqjovh (SN 2018bvw): An Optically Discovered Engine-driven Supernova Candidate with Luminous Radio Emission,"We present ZTF18aaqjovh (SN 2018bvw), a high-velocity (""broad-lined"") stripped-envelope (Type Ic) supernova (Ic-BL SN) discovered in the Zwicky Transient Facility one-day cadence survey. ZTF18aaqjovh shares a number of features in common with engine-driven explosions: the photospheric velocity and the shape of the optical light curve are very similar to those of the Type Ic-BL SN 1998bw, which was associated with a low-luminosity gamma-ray burst (LLGRB) and had relativistic ejecta. However, the radio luminosity of ZTF18aaqjovh is almost two orders of magnitude fainter than that of SN 1998bw at the same velocity phase, and the shock velocity is at most mildly relativistic (V = 0.06-0.4c). A search of high-energy catalogs reveals no compelling gamma-ray burst (GRB) counterpart to ZTF18aaqjovh, and the limit on the prompt GRB luminosity of ${L}_{\gamma ,\mathrm{iso}}\approx 1.6\times {10}^{48}\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ excludes a classical GRB but not an LLGRB. Altogether, ZTF18aaqjovh represents another transition event between engine-driven SNe associated with GRBs and ""ordinary"" Ic-BL SNe.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893..132H,[]
"Real-time, Value-driven Data Augmentation in the Era of LSST","The deluge of data from time-domain surveys is rendering traditional human-guided data collection and inference techniques impractical. We propose a novel approach for conducting data collection for science inference in the era of massive large-scale surveys that uses value-based metrics to autonomously strategize and coordinate follow-up in real time. We demonstrate the underlying principles in the Recommender Engine For Intelligent Transient Tracking (REFITT) that ingests live alerts from surveys and value-added inputs from data brokers to predict the future behavior of transients and design optimal data augmentation strategies given a set of scientific objectives. The prototype presented in this paper is tested to work given simulated Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) core-collapse supernova (CC SN) light curves from the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge data set. CC SNe were selected for the initial development phase as they are known to be difficult to classify, with the expectation that any learning techniques for them should be at least as effective for other transients. We demonstrate the behavior of REFITT on a random LSST night given ∼32,000 live CC SNe of interest. The system makes good predictions for the photometric behavior of the events and uses them to plan follow-up using a simple data-driven metric. We argue that machine-directed follow-up maximizes the scientific potential of surveys and follow-up resources by reducing downtime and bias in data collection.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893..127S,[]
Three-dimensional Simulations of Magnetar-powered Superluminous Supernovae,"A rapidly spinning magnetar in a young supernova (SN) can produce a superluminous transient by converting a fraction of its rotational energy into radiation. Here, we present the first three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations ever performed of a magnetar-powered SN in the circumstellar medium formed by the ejection of the outer layers of the star prior to the blast. We find that hydrodynamical instabilities form on two scales in the ejecta, not just one as in ordinary core-collapse SNe: in the hot bubble energized by the magnetar and in the forward shock of the SN as it plows up ambient gas. Pressure from the bubble also makes the instabilities behind the forward shock more violent and causes more mixing in the explosion than in normal SNe, with important consequences for the light curves and spectra of the event that cannot be captured by one-dimensional models. We also find that the magnetar can accelerate Ca and Si to velocities of ∼12,000 $\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ and account for their broadened emission lines in observations. Our simulations also reveal that energy from even weak magnetars can accelerate iron-group elements deep in the ejecta to 5000-7000 $\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ and explain the high-velocity Fe observed at early times in some core-collapse SNe such as SN 1987A.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893...99C,[]
Variability of Massive Stars in M31 from the Palomar Transient Factory,"Using data from the (intermediate) Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF), we characterize the time variability of ≈500 massive stars in M31. Our sample is those stars that are spectrally typed by Massey and collaborators, including Luminous Blue Variables, Wolf-Rayets, and warm and cool supergiants. We use the high-cadence, long-baseline (≈5 yr) data from the iPTF survey, coupled with data-processing tools that model complex features in the light curves. We find widespread photometric (R-band) variability in the upper Hertzsprung Russell diagram (or CMD) with an increasing prevalence of variability with later spectral types. Red stars (V - I > 1.5) exhibit larger amplitude fluctuations than their bluer counterparts. We extract a characteristic variability timescale, t<SUB>ch</SUB>, via wavelet transformations that are sensitive to both continuous and localized fluctuations. Cool supergiants are characterized by longer timescales (>100 days) than the hotter stars. The latter have typical timescales of tens of days but cover a wider range, from our resolution limit of a few days to longer than 100 days. Using a 60 night block of data straddling two nights with a cadence of around 2 minutes, we extracted t<SUB>ch</SUB> in the range 0.1-10 days with amplitudes of a few percent for 13 stars. Though there is broad agreement between the observed variability characteristics in the different parts of the upper CMD with theoretical predictions, detailed comparison requires models with a more comprehensive treatment of the various physical processes operating in these stars, such as pulsation, subsurface convection, and the effect of binary companions.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893...11S,[]
Gravitational-wave Radiation of Double Degenerates with Extremely Low-mass White Dwarf Companions,"Double degenerate (DD) systems are supposed to be significant gravitational-wave (GW) sources for future space-based GW detectors, e.g., the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Recently, one type of DD system with extremely low-mass WD (ELM WD; ≲ 0.30 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) companions was found in the ELM Survey. These companions have very short orbital periods and are therefore important sources for LISA detection. Further, due to the thick envelope of ELM WDs compared with massive WDs (e.g., CO WDs), they are much easier to find through the combination of electromagnetic (EM) and GW observations. In this paper, we first obtain the population of ELM WDs in DDs by considering the detailed evolutionary tracks of ELM WDs and then analyzing the GW radiation of these systems. We found that about 6 × 10<SUP>3</SUP> sources could be solely detected by LISA, including ∼2 × 10<SUP>3</SUP> chirping sources, and ∼13 (∼107) more sources are expected to be detected by both LISA and the ELM Survey (Gaia).",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893....2L,[]
The Low Earth Orbit Satellite Population and Impacts of the SpaceX Starlink Constellation,"I discuss the current low Earth orbit artificial satellite population and show that the proposed ""megaconstellation"" of circa 12,000 Starlink Internet satellites would dominate the lower part of the Earth orbit, below 600 km, with a latitude-dependent areal number density of between 0.005 and 0.01 objects per square degree at airmass <2. Such large, low-altitude satellites appear visually bright to ground observers, and the initial Starlinks are naked-eye objects. I model the expected number of illuminated satellites as a function of latitude, time of year, and time of night and summarize the range of possible consequences for ground-based astronomy. In winter at lower latitudes typical of major observatories, the satellites will not be illuminated for six hours in the middle of the night. However, at low elevations near twilight at intermediate latitudes (45°-55°, e.g., much of Europe) hundreds of satellites may be visible at once to naked-eye observers at dark sites.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892L..36M,[]

LAMOST J040643.69+542347.8: The Fastest Rotator in the Galaxy,"Rotation and binary interaction play important roles in understanding the nature of massive stars (≳8M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). Some interesting transients, such as the long-duration gamma-ray bursts, are thought to be originated from fast-rotating massive stars. Because the strong stellar wind can effectively spin down a metal-rich massive star with fast rotation, it is very hard to find single massive stars rotating critically in the Galaxy. In the present work reported is the discovery of the fastest rotator in the Galaxy, LAMOST J040643.69+542347.8, with a projected rotational velocity V<SUB>e</SUB> sin I ∼ 540 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is ∼100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> faster than that of the previous record holder HD 191423. The star has a spectral type of O6.5 Vnnn(f)p. Its He I λ4471 absorption line is blueshifted and asymmetric, while its He II λ4686 and Hα have central absorption reversals in their emissions. It is also a runaway star, which implies an origin in a close binary interaction. Compared to VFTS 285 and VFTS 102 (their V<SUB>e</SUB> sin I ∼ 610 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) in the Large Magellanic Cloud, LAMOST J040643.69+542347.8 has its own peculiar spectral characteristics and earlier spectral type. Moreover, LAMOST J040643.69+542347.8 is bright (B ∼ 13.9 mag) enough to allow future high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892L..26L,[]
The Lowest of the Low: Discovery of SN 2019gsc and the Nature of Faint Iax Supernovae,"We present the discovery and optical follow-up of the faintest supernova-like transient known. The event (SN 2019gsc) was discovered in a star-forming host at 53 Mpc by ATLAS. A detailed multicolor light curve was gathered with Pan-STARRS1 and follow-up spectroscopy was obtained with the Nordic Optical Telescope and Gemini-North. The spectra near maximum light show narrow features at low velocities of 3000-4000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, similar to the extremely low-luminosity SNe 2010ae and 2008ha, and the light curve displays a similar fast decline (Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(r) = 0.91 ± 0.10 mag). SNe 2010ae and 2008ha have been classified as SNe Iax, and together the three either make up a distinct physical class of their own or are at the extreme low-luminosity end of this diverse supernova population. The bolometric light curve is consistent with a low kinetic energy of explosion (E<SUB>k</SUB> ∼ 10<SUP>49</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>), a modest ejected mass (M<SUB>ej</SUB> ∼ 0.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), and radioactive powering by <SUP>56</SUP>Ni (M<SUB>Ni</SUB> ∼ 2 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). The spectra are quite well reproduced with radiative transfer models (TARDIS) and a composition dominated by carbon, oxygen, magnesium, silicon, and sulfur. Remarkably, all three of these extreme Iax events are in similar low-metallicity star-forming environments. The combination of the observational constraints for all three may be best explained by deflagrations of near M<SUB>Ch</SUB> hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon white dwarfs that have short evolutionary pathways to formation.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892L..24S,[]
Host Galaxies of Type Ic and Broad-lined Type Ic Supernovae from the Palomar Transient Factory: Implications for Jet Production,"Unlike ordinary supernovae (SNe), some of which are hydrogen and helium deficient (called Type Ic SNe), broad-lined Type Ic SNe (SNe Ic-bl) are very energetic events, and only SNe Ic-bl are coincident with long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Understanding the progenitors of SN Ic-bl explosions versus those of their SN Ic cousins is key to understanding the SN-GRB relationship and jet production in massive stars. Here we present the largest existing set of host galaxy spectra of 28 SNe Ic and 14 SNe Ic-bl, all discovered by the same galaxy-untargeted survey, namely, the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). We carefully measure their gas-phase metallicities, stellar masses (M<SUB>*</SUB>), and star formation rates (SFRs). We further reanalyze the hosts of 10 literature SN-GRBs using the same methods and compare them to our PTF SN hosts with the goal of constraining their progenitors from their local environments. We find that the metallicities, SFRs, and M<SUB>*</SUB> values of our PTF SN Ic-bl hosts are statistically comparable to those of SN-GRBs but significantly lower than those of the PTF SNe Ic. The mass-metallicity relations as defined by the SNe Ic-bl and SN-GRBs are not significantly different from the same relations as defined by Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies, contradicting claims by earlier works. Our findings point toward low metallicity as a crucial ingredient for SN Ic-bl and SN-GRB production since we are able to break the degeneracy between high SFR and low metallicity. We suggest that the PTF SNe Ic-bl may have produced jets that were choked inside the star or were able to break out of the star as unseen low-luminosity or off-axis GRBs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892..153M,[]
SN 2017cfd: A Normal Type Ia Supernova Discovered Very Young,"The Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2017cfd in IC 0511 (redshift z=0.01209 ± 0.00016) was discovered by the Lick Observatory Supernova Search 1.6 ± 0.7 day after the fitted first-light time (15.2 days before B-band maximum brightness). Photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations show that SN 2017cfd is a typical, normal SN Ia with a peak luminosity M<SUB>B</SUB> ≈ -19.2± 0.2 mag, Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(B) = 1.16 mag, and reached a B-band maximum ∼16.8 days after the first light. We estimate there to be moderately strong host-galaxy extinction (A<SUB>V</SUB> = 0.39 ± 0.03 mag) based on MLCS2k2 fitting. The spectrum reveals a Si II λ6355 velocity of ∼11,200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> at peak brightness. SN 2017cfd was discovered very young, with multiband data taken starting 2 days after the first light, making it a valuable complement to the currently small sample (fewer than a dozen) of SNe Ia with color data at such early times. We find that its intrinsic early-time (B-V)<SUB>0</SUB> color evolution belongs to the ""blue"" population rather than to the distinct ""red"" population. Using the photometry, we constrain the companion-star radius to be ≲2.5 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> with the Kasen model, thus ruling out a red-giant companion.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892..142H,[]
A Classification Algorithm for Time-domain Novelties in Preparation for LSST Alerts. Application to Variable Stars and Transients Detected with DECam in the Galactic Bulge,"With the advent of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, time-domain astronomy will be faced with an unprecedented volume and rate of data. Real-time processing of variables and transients detected by such large-scale surveys is critical to identifying the more unusual events and allocating scarce follow-up resources efficiently. We develop an algorithm to identify these novel events within a given population of variable sources. We determine the distributions of magnitude changes (dm) over time intervals (dt) for a given passband f, p<SUB>f</SUB>({dm}| {dt}), and use these distributions to compute the likelihood of a test source being consistent with the population or being an outlier. We demonstrate our algorithm by applying it to the DECam multiband time-series data of more than 2000 variable stars identified by Saha et al. in the Galactic Bulge that are largely dominated by long-period variables and pulsating stars. Our algorithm discovers 18 outlier sources in the sample, including a microlensing event, a dwarf nova, and two chromospherically active RS CVn stars, as well as sources in the blue horizontal branch region of the color-magnitude diagram without any known counterparts. We compare the performance of our algorithm for novelty detection with the multivariate Kernel Density Estimator and Isolation Forest on the simulated PLAsTiCC data set. We find that our algorithm yields comparable results despite its simplicity. Our method provides an efficient way for flagging the most unusual events in a real-time alert-broker system.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892..112S,[]

An diagram covering a time span of 124 years was plotted using photometry from old photographic and modern sky surveys. The diagram has a parabola shape, which made it possible to determine for the first time the quadratic elements of the brightness variations. Furthermore, it made it possible to calculate the rate of an evolutionary decrease in the period of V811 Oph s/year, which is consistent with the theoretical calculation results for the second intersection of the instability strip if this Cepheid is a classical one. The pulsation stability test proposed by Lombard and Koen confirmed the actual decrease in the period.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ARep...64..310B,[]
SUGAR: An improved empirical model of Type Ia supernovae based on spectral features,Context. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are widely used to measure the expansion of the Universe.

"Aims: This document develops a new SNe Ia spectral energy distribution (SED) model, called the SUpernova Generator And Reconstructor (SUGAR), which improves the spectral description of SNe Ia, and consequently could improve the distance measurements.",,,[]
"Methods: This model was constructed from SNe Ia spectral properties and spectrophotometric data from the Nearby Supernova Factory collaboration. In a first step, a principal component analysis-like method was used on spectral features measured at maximum light, which allowed us to extract the intrinsic properties of SNe Ia. Next, the intrinsic properties were used to extract the average extinction curve. Third, an interpolation using Gaussian processes facilitated using data taken at different epochs during the lifetime of an SN Ia and then projecting the data on a fixed time grid. Finally, the three steps were combined to build the SED model as a function of time and wavelength. This is the SUGAR model.",,,[]
"Results: The main advancement in SUGAR is the addition of two additional parameters to characterize SNe Ia variability. The first is tied to the properties of SNe Ia ejecta velocity and the second correlates with their calcium lines. The addition of these parameters, as well as the high quality of the Nearby Supernova Factory data, makes SUGAR an accurate and efficient model for describing the spectra of normal SNe Ia as they brighten and fade.",,,[]

Rates of Stellar Tidal Disruption,"Tidal disruption events occur rarely in any individual galaxy. Over the last decade, however, time-domain surveys have begun to accumulate statistical samples of these flares. What dynamical processes are responsible for feeding stars to supermassive black holes? At what rate are stars tidally disrupted in realistic galactic nuclei? What may we learn about supermassive black holes and broader astrophysical questions by estimating tidal disruption event rates from observational samples of flares?

The Host Galaxies of Tidal Disruption Events,"Recent studies of Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) have revealed unexpected correlations between the TDE rate and the large-scale properties of the host galaxies. In this review, we present the host galaxy properties of all TDE candidates known to date and quantify their distributions. We consider throughout the differences between observationally-identified types of TDEs and differences from spectroscopic control samples of galaxies. We focus here on the black hole and stellar masses of TDE host galaxies, their star formation histories and stellar populations, the concentration and morphology of the optical light, the presence of AGN activity, and the extra-galactic environment of the TDE hosts. We summarize the state of several possible explanations for the links between the TDE rate and host galaxy type. We present estimates of the TDE rate for different host galaxy types and quantify the degree to which rate enhancement in some types results in rate suppression in others. We discuss the possibilities for using TDE host galaxies to assist in identifying TDEs in upcoming large transient surveys and possibilities for TDE observations to be used to study their host galaxies.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020SSRv..216...32F,[]
Mechanism of High-Efficiency Electron Beam Generation in a High-Voltage Discharge in Helium and Its Mixtures with Oxygen and Nitrogen,"The results of investigation of the current-voltage characteristics (CVCs) and electron beam generation efficiency in continuous discharges in helium, its mixtures with oxygen and nitrogen, as well as in pure oxygen and helium are presented. Peculiarities of CVCs are singled out and interpreted in terms of a changed role of the principal emission mechanisms with an increase in the voltage. It is shown that a high efficiency of the electron beam generation of more than 80% can be achieved in glow discharges in helium, oxygen, and nitrogen. In helium, it is provided by the predominating photoemission, while in oxygen and nitrogen and their mixtures with helium - mainly by the kinetic emission under the impact of fast heavy particles.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020RuPhJ..62.1989B,[]

However, planetary systems which survive the transformation of their host stars into white dwarfs can be detected via photospheric trace metals, circumstellar dusty and gaseous discs, and transits of planetary debris crossing our line of sight. These signatures offer the potential to explore the efficiency of planet formation for host stars with masses up to the core-collapse boundary at $\approx 8\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$ , a mass regime rarely investigated in planet formation theory. Here, we establish limits on where both major and minor planets must reside around $\approx 6\rm {-}8\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$ stars in order to survive into the white dwarf phase. For this mass range, we find that intact terrestrial or giant planets need to leave the main sequence beyond approximate minimum star-planet separations of, respectively, about 3 and 6 au. In these systems, rubble pile minor planets of radii 10, 1.0, and 0.1 km would have been shorn apart by giant branch radiative YORP spin-up if they formed and remained within, respectively, tens, hundreds, and thousands of au. These boundary values would help distinguish the nature of the progenitor of metal pollution in white dwarf atmospheres. We find that planet formation around the highest mass white dwarf progenitors may be feasible, and hence encourage both dedicated planet formation investigations for these systems and spectroscopic analyses of the highest mass white dwarfs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493..765V,[]
Tidal disruption of planetary bodies by white dwarfs - II. Debris disc structure and ejected interstellar asteroids,"We make use of a new hybrid method to simulate the long-term, multiple-orbit disc formation through tidal disruptions of rocky bodies by white dwarfs, at high-resolution and realistic semimajor axis. We perform the largest yet suite of simulations for dwarf and terrestrial planets, spanning four orders of magnitude in mass, various pericentre distances, and semimajor axes between 3 and 150 au. This large phase space of tidal disruption conditions has not been accessible through the use of previous codes. We analyse the statistical and structural properties of the emerging debris discs, as well as the ejected unbound debris contributing to the population of interstellar asteroids. Unlike previous tidal disruption studies of small asteroids which form ring-like structures on the original orbit, we find that the tidal disruption of larger bodies usually forms dispersed structures of interlaced elliptic eccentric annuli on tighter orbits. We characterize the (typically power law) size distribution of the ejected interstellar bodies as well as their composition, rotation velocities, and ejection velocities. We find them to be sensitive to the depth (impact parameter) of the tidal disruption. Finally, we briefly discuss possible implications of our results in explaining the peculiar variability of Tabby's star, the origin of the transit events of ZTF J0139+5245 and the formation of a planetary core around SDSS J1228+1040.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493..698M,[]
Limits on the electromagnetic counterpart to S190814bv,"We derive limits on any electromagnetic counterpart to the compact binary merger S190814bv, whose parameters are consistent with the merger of a black hole and a neutron star. We present observations with the new wide-field optical imager DDOTI and also consider Swift/BAT observations reported by Palmer et al. We show that Swift/BAT would have detected a counterpart with similar properties to a typical on-axis short GRB at the 98 per cent confidence level, whereas our DDOTI observations only rule out such a counterpart at the 27 per cent confidence level. Neither has sufficient sensitivity to rule out an off-axis counterpart like GW 170817. We compare the efficiency of Swift/BAT and DDOTI for future observations, and show that DDOTI is likely to be about twice as efficient as Swift/BAT for off-axis events up to about 100 Mpc.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.5916W,[]
Constraining the origin of the planetary debris surrounding ZTF J0139+5245 through rotational fission of a triaxial asteroid,"White dwarfs containing orbiting planetesimals or their debris represent crucial benchmarks by which theoretical investigations of post-main-sequence planetary systems may be calibrated. The photometric transit signatures of likely planetary debris in the ZTF J0139+5245 white dwarf system have an orbital period of about 110 d. An asteroid which breaks up to produce this debris may spin itself to destruction through repeated close encounters with the star without entering its Roche radius and without influence from the white dwarf's luminosity. Here, we place coupled constraints on the orbital pericentre (q) and the ratio (β) of the middle to longest semiaxes of a triaxial asteroid which disrupts outside of this white dwarf's Roche radius (r<SUB>Roche</SUB>) soon after attaining its 110-d orbit. We find that disruption within tens of years is likely when β ≲ 0.6 and q ≈ 1.0-2.0r<SUB>Roche</SUB>, and when β ≲ 0.2 out to q ≈ 2.5r<SUB>Roche</SUB>. Analysing the longer time-scale disruption of triaxial asteroids around ZTF J0139+5245 is desirable but may require either an analytical approach relying on ergodic theory or novel numerical techniques.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.5291V,[]
The first six months of the Advanced LIGO's and Advanced Virgo's third observing run with GRANDMA,"We present the Global Rapid Advanced Network Devoted to the Multi-messenger Addicts (GRANDMA). The network consists of 21 telescopes with both photometric and spectroscopic facilities. They are connected together thanks to a dedicated infrastructure. The network aims at coordinating the observations of large sky position estimates of transient events to enhance their follow-up and reduce the delay between the initial detection and optical confirmation. The GRANDMA programme mainly focuses on follow-up of gravitational-wave alerts to find and characterize the electromagnetic counterpart during the third observational campaign of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. But it allows for follow-up of any transient alerts involving neutrinos or gamma-ray bursts, even those with poor spatial localization. We present the different facilities, tools, and methods we developed for this network and show its efficiency using observations of LIGO/Virgo S190425z, a binary neutron star merger candidate. We furthermore report on all GRANDMA follow-up observations performed during the first six months of the LIGO-Virgo observational campaign, and we derive constraints on the kilonova properties assuming that the events' locations were imaged by our telescopes.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.3904A,[]
Luminous Red Novae: population models and future prospects,"A class of optical transients known as Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) have recently been associated with mass ejections from binary stars undergoing common-envelope evolution. We use the population synthesis code COMPAS to explore the impact of a range of assumptions about the physics of common-envelope evolution on the properties of LRNe. In particular, we investigate the influence of various models for the energetics of LRNe on the expected event rate and light curve characteristics, and compare with the existing sample. We find that the Galactic rate of LRNe is ∼0.2 yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, in agreement with the observed rate. In our models, the luminosity function of Galactic LRNe covers multiple decades in luminosity and is dominated by signals from stellar mergers, consistent with observational constraints from iPTF and the Galactic sample of LRNe. We discuss how observations of the brightest LRNe may provide indirect evidence for the existence of massive (>40 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) red supergiants. Such LRNe could be markers along the evolutionary pathway leading to the formation of double compact objects. We make predictions for the population of LRNe observable in future transient surveys with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the Zwicky Transient Facility. In all plausible circumstances, we predict a selection-limited observable population dominated by bright, long-duration events caused by common envelope ejections. We show that the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will observe 20-750 LRNe per year, quickly constraining the luminosity function of LRNe and probing the physics of common-envelope events.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.3229H,[]

The explosive life of massive binaries,"Massive stars are born predominantly as members of binary (or higher multiplicity) systems, and the presence of a companion can significantly alter their life and final fate. Therefore, any observed sample of massive stars or associated transients is likely to be significantly influenced by the effects of binarity. Here, we focus on the relationship between massive binary evolution and core-collapse supernova events. In the vast majority of the cases, the first core-collapse event happening in a binary system unbinds the two stars. Studying the population of companion stars, either at the supernova site, or as ``widowed'' stars long after the explosion, can be used to constrain the previous orbital evolution of the binary progenitor, and explosion physics of their former companion. Specifically, the population of ``widowed'' stars might provide statistical constraints on the typical amplitude of black hole natal kicks without seeing neither the black holes nor the transient possibly associated to their formation. Binarity also has a large impact on the predicted population of supernova sub-types, including hydrogen-rich type II supernovae, with a significant fraction of hydrogen-rich stars at explosions being either merger products or accretors.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020CoSka..50..472R,[]

Optical Polarimetry of the Tidal Disruption Event AT2019DSG,"We present time-series imaging polarimetry observations of a nearby tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2019DSG at z = 0.0512 to probe the disruption mechanism and shed light on the accretion process. We obtain linear polarimetry using the Alhambra Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera on board the 2.5 m Nordic Optical Telescope. Our observations showed a polarization at the 9.2% ± 2.7% level early on, decreasing to less than 2.7% (at the 68% confidence level) one month later. While the high level of polarization in the early epoch is similar to that of Swift J164449.3+573451 and Swift J2058+0516, the low level of polarization in the later epoch is in agreement with that of OGLE16aaa. Our results thus show the temporal evolution of optical polarization from a TDE. As the degree of polarization changes over time, it is unlikely to be attributed to host galaxy dust, but may originate from a non-isotropic accreting disk, or associated with the relativistic jet emission.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892L...1L,[]
SN 2010kd: Photometric and Spectroscopic Analysis of a Slow-decaying Superluminous Supernova,"This paper presents data and analysis of SN 2010kd, a low-redshift (z = 0.101) H-deficient superluminous supernova (SLSN), based on ultraviolet/optical photometry and optical spectroscopy spanning between -28 and +194 days relative to B-band maximum light. The B-band light-curve comparison of SN 2010kd with a subset of well-studied SLSNe I at comparable redshifts indicates that it is a slow-decaying PTF12dam-like SLSN. Analytical light-curve modeling using the Minim code suggests that the bolometric light curve of SN 2010kd favors circumstellar matter interaction for the powering mechanism. SYNAPPS modeling of the early-phase spectra does not identify broad H or He lines, whereas the photospheric-phase spectra are dominated by O I, O II, C II, C IV, and Si II, in particular the presence of both low- and high-velocity components of O II and Si II lines. The nebular-phase spectra of SN 2010kd are dominated by O I and Ca II emission lines similar to those seen in other SLSNe I. The line velocities in SN 2010kd exhibit flatter evolution curves similar to SN 2015bn but with comparatively higher values. SN 2010kd shows a higher single-zone local thermodynamic equilibrium temperature in comparison to PTF12dam and SN 2015bn, and it has an upper O I ejected mass limit of ∼10 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The host of SN 2010kd is a dwarf galaxy with a high star formation rate (∼0.18 ± 0.04 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) and extreme emission lines.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892...28K,[]
The HSC-SSP Transient Survey: Implications from Early Photometry and Rise Time of Normal Type Ia Supernovae,"With a booming number of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered within a few days of their explosions, a fraction of SNe Ia that show luminosity excess in the early phase (early-excess SNe Ia) have been confirmed. In this article, we report early-phase observations of seven photometrically normal SNe Ia (six early detections and one deep non detection limit) at the COSMOS field through a half-year transient survey as a part of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC SSP). In particular, a blue light-curve excess was discovered for HSC17bmhk, a normal SN Ia with rise time longer than 18.8 days, during the first four days after the discovery. The blue early excess in optical wavelength can be explained not only by interactions with a nondegenerate companion or surrounding dense circumstellar matter but also radiation powered by radioactive decays of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni at the surface of the SN ejecta. Given the growing evidence of the early-excess discoveries in normal SNe Ia that have longer rise times than the average, and a similarity in the nature of the blue excess to a luminous SN Ia subclass, we infer that early excess discovered in HSC17bmhk and other normal SNe Ia are most likely attributed to radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni decay at the surface of the SN ejecta. In order to successfully identify normal SNe Ia with early excess similar to that of HSC17bmhk, early UV photometries or high-cadence blue-band surveys are necessary.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892...25J,[]
The First Ultracompact Roche Lobe-Filling Hot Subdwarf Binary,"We report the discovery of the first short-period binary in which a hot subdwarf star (sdOB) filled its Roche lobe and started mass transfer to its companion. The object was discovered as part of a dedicated high-cadence survey of the Galactic plane named the Zwicky Transient Facility and exhibits a period of P = 39.3401(1) minutes, making it the most compact hot subdwarf binary currently known. Spectroscopic observations are consistent with an intermediate He-sdOB star with an effective temperature of T_{eff} = 42,400 ± 300 K and a surface gravity of log (g) = 5.77 ± 0.05. A high signal-to-noise ratio GTC+HiPERCAM light curve is dominated by the ellipsoidal deformation of the sdOB star and an eclipse of the sdOB by an accretion disk. We infer a low-mass hot subdwarf donor with a mass M<SUB>sdOB</SUB> = 0.337 ± 0.015 M_{⊙} and a white dwarf accretor with a mass M<SUB>WD</SUB> = 0.545 ± 0.020 M_{⊙}. Theoretical binary modeling indicates the hot subdwarf formed during a common envelope phase when a 2.5-2.8 M_{⊙} star lost its envelope when crossing the Hertzsprung gap. To match its current P_{orb}, T_{eff}, log (g), and masses, we estimate a post-common envelope period of P_{orb} ≈ 150 minutes and find that the sdOB star is currently undergoing hydrogen shell burning. We estimate that the hot subdwarf will become a white dwarf with a thick helium layer of ≈0.1 M_{⊙}, merge with its carbon/oxygen white dwarf companion after ≈17 Myr, and presumably explode as a thermonuclear supernova or form an R CrB star.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...891...45K,[]
The rise and fall of an extraordinary Ca-rich transient. The discovery of ATLAS19dqr/SN 2019bkc,"This work presents the observations and analysis of ATLAS19dqr/SN 2019bkc, an extraordinary rapidly evolving transient event located in an isolated environment, tens of kiloparsecs from any likely host. Its light curves rise to maximum light in 5-6 d and then display a decline of Δm<SUB>15</SUB> ∼ 5 mag. With such a pronounced decay, it has one of the most rapidly evolving light curves known for a stellar explosion. The early spectra show similarities to normal and ""ultra-stripped"" type Ic SNe, but the early nebular phase spectra, which were reached just over two weeks after explosion, display prominent calcium lines, marking SN 2019bkc as a Ca-rich transient. The Ca emission lines at this phase show an unprecedented and unexplained blueshift of 10 000-12 000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Modelling of the light curve and the early spectra suggests that the transient had a low ejecta mass of 0.2-0.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a low kinetic energy of (2-4) × 10<SUP>50</SUP> erg, giving a specific kinetic energy E<SUB>k</SUB>/M<SUB>ej</SUB> ∼ 1 [10<SUP>51</SUP> erg]/M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The origin of this event cannot be unambiguously defined. While the abundance distribution used to model the spectra marginally favours a progenitor of white dwarf origin through the tentative identification of Ar II, the specific kinetic energy, which is defined by the explosion mechanism, is found to be more similar to an ultra-stripped core-collapse events. SN 2019bkc adds to the diverse range of physical properties shown by Ca-rich events.",,[]

"Palomar Gattini-IR: Survey Overview, Data Processing System, On-sky Performance and First Results","Palomar Gattini-IR is a new wide-field, near-infrared (NIR) robotic time domain survey operating at Palomar Observatory. Using a 30 cm telescope mounted with a H2RG detector, Gattini-IR achieves a field of view (FOV) of 25 sq. deg. with a pixel scale of 8.″7 in J-band. Here, we describe the system design, survey operations, data processing system and on-sky performance of Palomar Gattini-IR. As a part of the nominal survey, Gattini-IR scans ≈7500 square degrees of the sky every night to a median 5σ depth of 15.7 AB mag outside the Galactic plane. The survey covers ≈15,000 square degrees of the sky visible from Palomar with a median cadence of 2 days. A real-time data processing system produces stacked science images from dithered raw images taken on sky, together with point-spread function (PSF)-fit source catalogs and transient candidates identified from subtractions within a median delay of ≈4 hr from the time of observation. The calibrated data products achieve an astrometric accuracy (rms) of ≈0.″7 with respect to Gaia DR2 for sources with signal-to-noise ratio > 10, and better than ≈0.″35 for sources brighter than ≈12 Vega mag. The photometric accuracy (rms) achieved in the PSF-fit source catalogs is better than ≈3% for sources brighter than ≈12 Vega mag and fainter than the saturation magnitude of ≈8.5 Vega mag, as calibrated against the Two Micron All Sky Survey catalog. The detection efficiency of transient candidates injected into the images is better than 90% for sources brighter than the 5σ limiting magnitude. The photometric recovery precision of injected sources is 3% for sources brighter than 13 mag, and the astrometric recovery rms is ≈0.″9. Reference images generated by stacking several field visits achieve depths of ≳16.5 AB mag over 60% of the sky, while it is limited by confusion in the Galactic plane. With a FOV ≈40× larger than any other existing NIR imaging instrument, Gattini-IR is probing the reddest and dustiest transients in the local universe such as dust obscured supernovae in nearby galaxies, novae behind large columns of extinction within the galaxy, reddened microlensing events in the Galactic plane and variability from cool and dust obscured stars.

Orbital Dynamics of 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB>: the First Vatira Asteroid,"Vatira-class near-Earth objects (NEOs) have orbits entirely interior to the orbit of Venus with aphelia 0.307 < Q < 0.718 AU. Recently discovered asteroid 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB> by the Zwicky Transient Facility on 4 January 2020 is the first known object on a Vatira orbit. Numerical integrations of 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB>'s nominal orbit show it remaining in the Vatira region for the next few hundred kyr before coupling to Venus and evolving onto an Atira orbit (NEOs entirely interior to Earth's orbit with 0.718 < Q < 0.983 AU) and eventually scattering out to Earth-crossing.

Missing red supergiants and carbon burning,"Recent studies on direct imaging of Type II core-collapse supernova progenitors indicate a possible threshold around M<SUB>ZAMS</SUB> ∼ 16-20 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, where red supergiants (RSG) with larger birth masses do not appear to result in supernova explosions and instead implode directly into a black hole. In this study, we argue that it is not a coincidence that this threshold closely matches the critical transition of central carbon burning in massive stars from the convective to radiative regime. In lighter stars, carbon burns convectively in the centre and result in compact final pre-supernova cores that are likely to result in explosions, while in heavier stars after the transition, it burns as a radiative flame and the stellar cores become significantly harder to explode. Using the kepler code we demonstrate the sensitivity of this transition to the rate of <SUP>12</SUP>C(α, γ)<SUP>16</SUP>O reaction and the overshoot mixing efficiency, and we argue that the upper mass limit of exploding RSG could be employed to constrain uncertain input physics of massive stellar evolution calculations.

"Post-main-sequence debris from rotation-induced YORP break-up of small bodies - II. Multiple fissions, internal strengths, and binary production","Over one-quarter of white dwarfs contain observable metallic debris from the break-up of exo-asteroids. Understanding the physical and orbital history of this debris would enable us to self-consistently link planetary system formation and fate. One major debris reservoir is generated by YORP-induced rotational fission during the giant branch phases of stellar evolution, where the stellar luminosity can exceed the Sun's by four orders of magnitude. Here, we determine the efficacy of the giant branch YORP effect for asteroids with non-zero internal strength, and model post-fission evolution by imposing simple analytic fragmentation prescriptions. We find that even the highest realistic internal strengths cannot prevent the widespread fragmentation of asteroids and the production of a debris field over 100 au in size. We compute the number of successive fission events as they occur in progressively smaller time intervals as the star ascends the giant branches, providing a way to generate size distributions of asteroid fragments. The results are highly insensitive to progenitor stellar mass. We also conclude that the ease with which giant branch YORP break-up can generate binary asteroid subsystems is strongly dependent on internal strength. Formed binary subsystems in turn could be short-lived due to the resulting luminosity-enhanced binary YORP (BYORP) effect.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.2437V,[]
LSQ13ddu: a rapidly evolving stripped-envelope supernova with early circumstellar interaction signatures,"This paper describes the rapidly evolving and unusual supernova LSQ13ddu, discovered by the La Silla-QUEST survey. LSQ13ddu displayed a rapid rise of just 4.8 ± 0.9 d to reach a peak brightness of -19.70 ± 0.02 mag in the LSQgr band. Early spectra of LSQ13ddu showed the presence of weak and narrow He I features arising from interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). These interaction signatures weakened quickly, with broad features consistent with those seen in stripped-envelope SNe becoming dominant around two weeks after maximum. The narrow He I velocities are consistent with the wind velocities of luminous blue variables but its spectra lack the typically seen hydrogen features. The fast and bright early light curve is inconsistent with radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni powering but can be explained through a combination of CSM interaction and an underlying <SUP>56</SUP>Ni decay component that dominates the later time behaviour of LSQ13ddu.

Implications of the search for optical counterparts during the first six months of the Advanced LIGO's and Advanced Virgo's third observing run: possible limits on the ejecta mass and binary properties,"GW170817 showed that neutron star mergers not only emit gravitational waves but also can release electromagnetic signatures in multiple wavelengths. Within the first half of the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, there have been a number of gravitational wave candidates of compact binary systems for which at least one component is potentially a neutron star. In this article, we look at the candidates S190425z, S190426c, S190510g, S190901ap, and S190910h, predicted to have potentially a non-zero remnant mass, in more detail. All these triggers have been followed up with extensive campaigns by the astronomical community doing electromagnetic searches for their optical counterparts; however, according to the released classification, there is a high probability that some of these events might not be of extraterrestrial origin. Assuming that the triggers are caused by a compact binary coalescence and that the individual source locations have been covered during the EM follow-up campaigns, we employ three different kilonova models and apply them to derive possible constraints on the matter ejection consistent with the publicly available gravitational-wave trigger information and the lack of a kilonova detection. These upper bounds on the ejecta mass can be related to limits on the maximum mass of the binary neutron star candidate S190425z and to constraints on the mass-ratio, spin, and NS compactness for the potential black hole-neutron star candidate S190426c.

Constraining the fraction of core-collapse supernovae harbouring choked jets with high-energy neutrinos,"The joint observation of core-collapse supernovae with gamma-ray bursts shows that jets can be launched in the aftermath of stellar core collapse, likely by a newly formed black hole that accretes matter from the star. Such gamma-ray bursts have only been observed accompanying Type Ibc supernovae, indicating a stellar progenitor that lost its hydrogen envelope before collapse. According to recent hypothesis, it is possible that jets are launched in core-collapse events even when the progenitors still retain their hydrogen envelopes; however, such jets are not able to burrow through the star and will be stalled into the interior of the progenitor star before escaping. These jets are called choked jets. High-energy neutrinos produced by such choked jets could escape the stellar envelope and could be observed. Here, we examine how multimessenger searches for high-energy neutrinos and core-collapse supernovae can detect or limit the fraction of stellar collapses that produce jets. We find that a high fraction of jet production is already limited by previous observational campaigns. We explore possibilities with future observations using Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, IceCube, and Km3NET.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492..843G,[]
Self-intersection of the fallback stream in tidal disruption events,"We propose a semi-analytical model for the self-intersection of the fallback stream in tidal disruption events (TDEs). When the initial periapsis is less than about 15 gravitational radii, a large fraction of the shocked gas is unbound in the form of a collision-induced outflow (CIO). This is because large apsidal precession causes the stream to self-intersect near the local escape speed at radius much below the apocentre. The rest of the fallback gas is left in more tightly bound orbits and quickly joins the accretion flow. We propose that the CIO is responsible for reprocessing the hard emission from the accretion flow into the optical band. This picture naturally explains the large photospheric radius [or low blackbody (BB) temperature] and typical line widths for optical TDEs. We predict the CIO-reprocessed spectrum in the infrared to be L<SUB>ν</SUB> ∝ ν<SUP>∼0.5</SUP>, shallower than a BB. The partial sky coverage of the CIO also provides a unification of the diverse X-ray behaviours of optical TDEs. According to this picture, optical surveys filter out a large fraction of TDEs with low-mass blackholes due to lack of a reprocessing layer, and the volumetric rate of optical TDEs is nearly flat wrt. the blackhole mass in the range M≲ 10^7 M_{⊙}. This filtering also causes the optical TDE rate to be lower than the total rate by a factor of ∼10 or more. When the CIO is decelerated by the ambient medium, radio emission at the level of that in ASASSN-14li is produced, but the time-scales and peak luminosities can be highly diverse. Finally, our method paves the way for global simulations of the disc formation process by injecting gas at the intersection point according to the prescribed velocity and density profiles.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492..686L,[]
Pulsation in faint blue stars,"Following the discovery of blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) by the OGLE survey, additional hot, high-amplitude pulsating stars have been discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility.

With this expanded population of pulsating objects, it was decided to compute a sequence of post-common-envelope stellar models using the MESA stellar evolution code and to examine the pulsation properties of low-mass pre-white dwarfs using non-adiabatic analysis with the GYRE stellar oscillation code. By including the effects of atomic diffusion and radiative levitation, it is shown that a large region of instability exists from effective temperatures of 30 000 K up to temperatures of at least 50 000 K and at a wide range of surface gravities. This encompasses both groups of pulsator observed so far, and confirms that the driving mechanism is through iron group element opacity. We make some conservative estimates about the range of periods, masses, temperatures, and gravities in which further such pulsators might be observed.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492..232B,[]
Probing the extragalactic fast transient sky at minute time-scales with DECam,"Searches for optical transients are usually performed with a cadence of days to weeks, optimized for supernova discovery. The optical fast transient sky is still largely unexplored, with only a few surveys to date having placed meaningful constraints on the detection of extragalactic transients evolving at sub-hour time-scales. Here, we present the results of deep searches for dim, minute-time-scale extragalactic fast transients using the Dark Energy Camera, a core facility of our all-wavelength and all-messenger Deeper, Wider, Faster programme. We used continuous 20 s exposures to systematically probe time-scales down to 1.17 min at magnitude limits g > 23 (AB), detecting hundreds of transient and variable sources. Nine candidates passed our strict criteria on duration and non-stellarity, all of which could be classified as flare stars based on deep multiband imaging. Searches for fast radio burst and gamma-ray counterparts during simultaneous multifacility observations yielded no counterparts to the optical transients. Also, no long-term variability was detected with pre-imaging and follow-up observations using the SkyMapper optical telescope. We place upper limits for minute-time-scale fast optical transient rates for a range of depths and time-scales. Finally, we demonstrate that optical g-band light-curve behaviour alone cannot discriminate between confirmed extragalactic fast transients such as prompt GRB flashes and Galactic stellar flares.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491.5852A,[]
Understanding extreme quasar optical variability with CRTS - II. Changing-state quasars,"We present the results of a systematic search for quasars in the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey exhibiting both strong photometric variability and spectroscopic variability over a decadal baseline. We identify 111 sources with specific patterns of optical and mid-infrared photometric behaviour and a defined spectroscopic change. These 'changing-state' quasars (CSQs) form a higher luminosity sample to complement existing sets of 'changing-look' AGNs and quasars in the literature. The CSQs (by selection) exhibit larger photometric variability than the changing-look quasars (CLQs). The spectroscopic variability is marginally stronger in the CSQs than CLQs as defined by the change in H β/[O III] ratio. We find 48 sources with declining H β flux and 63 sources with increasing H β flux, and discover 8 sources with z > 0.8, further extending the redshift arm. Our CSQ sample compares to the literature CLQ objects in similar distributions of H β flux ratios and differential Eddington ratios between high (bright) and low (dim) states. Taken as a whole, we find that this population of extreme varying quasars is associated with changes in the Eddington ratio and the time-scales imply cooling/heating fronts propagating through the disc.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491.4925G,[]
Observation of the Second LIGO/Virgo Event Connected with a Binary Neutron Star Merger S190425z in the Gamma-Ray Range,"The results of observations of the gravitational-wave (GW) event S190425z recorded by the LIGO/Virgo detectors with the anti-coincidence shield (ACS) of the SPI gamma-ray spectrometer onboard the INTEGRAL observatory are presented. With a high probability (>99%) it was associated with a neutron star (NS) merger in a close binary system. This is only the second event of such a type in the history of gravitational-wave observations (after GW170817). A weak gamma-ray burst, GRB190425, consisting of two pulses ∼0.5 and ∼5.9 s after the NS merger in the event S190425z with an a priori significance of 3.5 and 4.4σ (taken together 5.5σ) was detected by SPI-ACS. Analysis of the SPI-ACS count rate history recorded on these days (a total of ∼125 ks of observations) has shown that the rate of random occurrence of two close spikes with the characteristics of GRB190425 does not exceed 6.4 × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> (i.e., such events occur by chance, on average, every ∼4.3 hours). Note that the time profile of GRB190425 has much in common with the profile of GRB170817A accompanying the event GW170817, that both NS mergers were the nearest (≤150 Mpc) of all the events recorded by the LIGO/Virgo detectors, and that no significant excesses of the gamma-ray flux above the background were detected in any of ∼30 black hole merger events recorded to date by these detectors. No bursts of hard radiation were detected in the field of view of the SPI and IBIS/ISGRI gamma-ray telescopes onboard INTEGRAL. This, along with the absence of detection of gamma-ray emission from GRB190425 by the GBM gamma-ray burst monitor of the Fermi observatory suggesting its occultation by the Earth, allows the localization region for the source of this GWevent to be reduced significantly. The parameters E<SUB>iso</SUB> and E<SUB>p</SUB> for GRB190425 are estimated and compared with those for GRB170817A.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AstL...45..710P,[]
Rapid Transients Originating from Thermonuclear Explosions in Helium White Dwarf Tidal Disruption Events,"We study the emission properties of thermonuclear explosions in a helium white dwarf (WD) tidal disruption event (TDE). We consider a TDE where a 0.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> helium WD is disrupted by a 10<SUP>2.5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). The helium WD is not only tidally disrupted but is also detonated by the tidal compression and by succeeding shocks. We focus on the emission powered by radioactive nuclei in the unbound TDE ejecta. We perform hydrodynamic simulations coupled with nuclear reactions, post-process detailed nucleosynthesis calculations, and radiative transfer simulations. We thus derive multi-band light curves and spectra. The helium WD TDE shows rapid (Δt<SUB>1mag</SUB> ≃ 5-10 days) and relatively faint ( ${L}_{\mathrm{peak}}\simeq {10}^{42}\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ ) light curves, because the ejecta mass and <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass are low (0.12 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and 0.03 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, respectively). The spectra show strong calcium and Fe-peak features and very weak silicon features, reflecting the peculiar elemental abundance. The key feature is the Doppler shift of the spectral lines up to ≃ ±12,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, depending on the viewing angle, due to the bulk motion of the ejecta. Our model matches well with two rapid and faint transients reported in Pursiainen et al. The particular model presented here does not match with observed SNe Iax, calcium-rich transients, or .Ia explosion candidates, either in the spectra or light curves. However, we expect a large variety of observational signatures once a wide range of the WD/black hole masses and orbital parameters are considered. This study contributes to the search for WD TDEs with current and upcoming surveys, and to the identification of IMBHs as disrupters in TDEs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...890L..26K,[]
A New Method to Classify Type IIP/IIL Supernovae Based on Their Spectra,"Type IIP and Type IIL supernovae are defined on the basis of their light curves, but the spectral criteria for distinguishing these two types of supernovae (SNe) remain unclear. We propose a spectral classification method. First, we subtract the principal components of different wavelength bands in the spectra based on the functional principal components analysis method. Then, we use support vector machine and artificial neural network to classify these two types of SNe. The best F1_Score of our classifier is 0.871 for SNe IIL, and 0.974 for SNe IIP. We found that by only using the H<SUB>α</SUB> line at 6150-6800 Å for classification, the F1_Score up to 0.961 for Type IIP, and 0.818 for Type IIL SNe can be obtained. These results indicate that the profile of the H<SUB>α</SUB> spectral line is the key to distinguishing the two types of SNe.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...890..177K,[]
GROWTH on S190814bv: Deep Synoptic Limits on the Optical/Near-infrared Counterpart to a Neutron Star-Black Hole Merger,"On 2019 August 14, the Advanced LIGO and Virgo interferometers detected the high-significance gravitational wave (GW) signal S190814bv. The GW data indicated that the event resulted from a neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger, or potentially a low-mass binary BH merger. Due to the low false-alarm rate and the precise localization (23 deg<SUP>2</SUP> at 90%), S190814bv presented the community with the best opportunity yet to directly observe an optical/near-infrared counterpart to an NSBH merger. To search for potential counterparts, the GROWTH Collaboration performed real-time image subtraction on six nights of public Dark Energy Camera images acquired in the 3 weeks following the merger, covering >98% of the localization probability. Using a worldwide network of follow-up facilities, we systematically undertook spectroscopy and imaging of optical counterpart candidates. Combining these data with a photometric redshift catalog, we ruled out each candidate as the counterpart to S190814bv and placed deep, uniform limits on the optical emission associated with S190814bv. For the nearest consistent GW distance, radiative transfer simulations of NSBH mergers constrain the ejecta mass of S190814bv to be M<SUB>ej</SUB> < 0.04 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> at polar viewing angles, or M<SUB>ej</SUB> < 0.03 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> if the opacity is κ < 2 cm<SUP>2</SUP>g<SUP>-1</SUP>. Assuming a tidal deformability for the NS at the high end of the range compatible with GW170817 results, our limits would constrain the BH spin component aligned with the orbital momentum to be χ < 0.7 for mass ratios Q < 6, with weaker constraints for more compact NSs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...890..131A,[]
Simulating Turbulence-aided Neutrino-driven Core-collapse Supernova Explosions in One Dimension,"The core-collapse supernova (CCSN) mechanism is fundamentally 3D, with instabilities, convection, and turbulence playing crucial roles in aiding neutrino-driven explosions. Simulations of CCNSe including accurate treatments of neutrino transport and sufficient resolution to capture key instabilities remain among the most expensive numerical simulations in astrophysics, prohibiting large parameter studies in 2D and 3D. Studies spanning a large swath of the incredibly varied initial conditions of CCSNe are possible in 1D, though such simulations must be artificially driven to explode. We present a new method for including the most important effects of convection and turbulence in 1D simulations of neutrino-driven CCSNe, called Supernova Turbulence In Reduced-dimensionality, or STIR. Our new approach includes crucial terms resulting from the turbulent and convective motions of the flow. We estimate the strength of convection and turbulence using a modified mixing-length theory approach, introducing a few free parameters to the model that are fit to the results of 3D simulations. For sufficiently large values of the mixing-length parameter, turbulence-aided neutrino-driven explosions are obtained. We compare the results of STIR to high-fidelity 3D simulations and perform a parameter study of CCSN explosion using 200 solar-metallicity progenitor models from 9 to 120 ${M}_{\odot }$ . We find that STIR is a better predictor of which models will explode in multidimensional simulations than other methods of driving explosions in 1D. We also present a preliminary investigation of predicted observable characteristics of the CCSN population from STIR, such as the distributions of explosion energies and remnant masses.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...890..127C,[]
The Prospects of Observing Tidal Disruption Events with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope,"The upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will observe 18,000 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of the southern sky and is expected to discover thousands of transients every night due to its large coverage area and its observing strategy. In this work, we address the prospects for the LSST in discovering tidal disruption events (TDEs) and in probing the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass distribution in the universe. We used the LSST simulation framework and defined TDE catalogs on 20 fields of 20.25 deg<SUP>2</SUP> size. TDE properties were defined by randomly chosen impact factors and SMBH masses drawn from six different mass distributions. Observations of TDEs over 10 years of LSST operation were simulated by querying the simulated observing strategy database minion_1016. Based on the results of our simulations, we estimate that the LSST should discover between 35,000 and 80,000 TDEs in 10 years of operation, depending on the assumed SMBH mass distribution. We also find that probing the SMBH mass distribution with TDE observations will not be straightforward, due to the fact that TDEs caused by low-mass black holes (10<SUP>5</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) are expected to be less luminous and shorter than TDEs by heavier SMBHs (> 10<SUP>6</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), and therefore will mostly be missed by the irregular LSST cadence minion_1016.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...890...73B,[]
Possible Formation Scenarios of ZTF J153932.16+502738.8—A Gravitational Source Close to the Peak of LISA's Sensitivity,"ZTF J153932.16+502738.8 (ZTFJ1539) is an eclipsing double-white-dwarf system with an orbital period of 6.91 minutes, and a significant source for LISA detection of gravitational waves. However, the massive white dwarf (WD), with a mass of about 0.61 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, has a high effective temperature (48,900 K), and the lower-mass WD, with a mass of about 0.21 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, has a low effective temperature (<10,000 K). This discrepancy challenges the popular theory of binary evolution. We investigate the formation of ZTFJ1539 via nova and Algol scenarios. Assuming that the massive WD in ZTFJ1539 just experiences a thermonuclear runaway, the nova scenario can explain the effective temperatures of the two WDs in ZTFJ1539. However, in order to enlarge a semi-detached orbit of about 4-5 minutes to a detached orbit of about 7 minutes, the nova scenario needs a much higher kick velocity of about 200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> during nova eruption. The high kick velocity can result in a high eccentricity of about 0.2-0.6. The Algol scenario can also produce ZTFJ1539 if we take a high efficient parameter for ejecting the common envelope and enhance the mass-loss rate via stellar wind trigger by tidal effect.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...890...69L,[]
Superflares on Solar-type Stars from the First Year Observation of TESS,"Superflares, which are strong explosions on stars, have been well studied with the progress of spacetime-domain astronomy. In this work, we present the study of superflares on solar-type stars using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data. Thirteen sectors of observations during the first year of the TESS mission covered the southern hemisphere of the sky, containing 25,734 solar-type stars. We verified 1216 superflares on 400 solar-type stars through automatic search and visual inspection with 2 minute cadence data. Our result suggests a higher superflare frequency distribution than the result from Kepler. This may be because the majority of TESS solar-type stars in our data set are rapidly rotating stars. The power-law index γ of the superflare frequency distribution ( ${dN}/{dE}\propto {E}^{-\gamma }$ ) is constrained to be γ = 2.16 ± 0.10, which is a little larger than that of solar flares but consistent with the results from Kepler. Because only seven superflares of Sun-like stars are detected, we cannot give a robust superflare occurrence frequency. Four stars were accompanied by unconfirmed hot planet candidates. Therefore, superflares may possibly be caused by stellar magnetic activities instead of planet-star interactions. We also find an extraordinary star, TIC43472154, which exhibits about 200 superflares per year. In addition, the correlation between the energy and duration of superflares ( ${T}_{\mathrm{duration}}\propto {E}^{\beta }$ ) is analyzed. We derive the power-law index to be β = 0.42 ± 0.01, which is a little larger than β = 1/3 from the prediction according to magnetic reconnection theory.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...890...46T,[]
An Extreme X-Ray Variability Event of a Weak-line Quasar,"We report the discovery of an extreme X-ray flux rise (by a factor of ≳20) of the weak-line quasar Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) J153913.47+395423.4 (hereafter SDSS J1539+3954) at z = 1.935. SDSS J1539+3954 is the most-luminous object among radio-quiet type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) where such dramatic X-ray variability has been observed. Before the X-ray flux rise, SDSS J1539+3954 appeared X-ray weak compared with the expectation from its ultraviolet (UV) flux; after the rise, the ratio of its X-ray flux and UV flux is consistent with the majority of the AGN population. We also present a contemporaneous HET spectrum of SDSS J1539+3954, which demonstrates that its UV continuum level remains generally unchanged despite the dramatic increase in the X-ray flux, and its C IV emission line remains weak. The dramatic change only observed in the X-ray flux is consistent with a shielding model, where a thick inner accretion disk can block our line of sight to the central X-ray source. This thick inner accretion disk can also block the nuclear ionizing photons from reaching the high-ionization broad emission-line region, so that weak high-ionization emission lines are observed. Under this scenario, the extreme X-ray variability event may be caused by slight variations in the thickness of the disk. This event might also be explained by gravitational light-bending effects in a reflection model.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...889L..37N,[]
Diversity of Kilonova Light Curves,"We perform radiative transfer simulations for kilonova in various situations, including the cases of prompt collapse to a black hole from neutron star mergers, high-velocity ejecta possibly accelerated by magnetars, and a black hole-neutron star merger. Our calculations are done employing ejecta profiles predicted by numerical-relativity simulations and a new line list for all the r-process elements. We found that: (I) the optical emission for binary neutron stars promptly collapsing to a black hole would be fainter by ≳1-2 mag than that found in GW170817, while the infrared emission could be as bright as that in GW170817 if the post-merger ejecta is as massive as ≈0.01 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>; (II) the kilonova would be brighter than that observed in GW170817 for the case that the ejecta is highly accelerated by the electromagnetic energy injection from the remnant, but within a few days it would decline rapidly and the magnitude would become fainter than in GW170817; and (III) the optical emission from a black hole-neutron star merger ejecta could be as bright as that observed in GW170817 for the case that sufficiently large amount of matter is ejected (≳0.02 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), while the infrared brightness would be brighter by 1-2 mag at the same time. We show that the difference in the ejecta properties would be imprinted in the differences in the peak brightness and time of peak. This indicates that we may be able to infer the type of the central engine for kilonovae by observation of the peak in the multiple band.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...889..171K,[]
Pre-discovery Activity of New Interstellar Comet 2I/Borisov beyond 5 au,"Comet 2I/Borisov, the first unambiguous interstellar comet ever found, was discovered in 2019 August at ∼3 au from the Sun on its inbound leg. No pre-discovery detection beyond 3 au has yet been reported, mostly due to the comet's proximity to the Sun as seen from the Earth. Here we present a search for pre-discovery detections of comet Borisov using images taken by the Catalina Sky Survey, Pan-STARRS, and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), with a further comprehensive follow-up campaign being presented in Bolin et al. We identified comet Borisov in ZTF images taken in 2019 May and use these data to update its orbit. This allowed us to identify the comet in images acquired as far back as 2018 December, when it was 7.8 au from the Sun. The comet was not detected in 2018 November when it was 8.6 au from the Sun, possibly implying an onset of activity around this time. This suggests that the activity of the comet is either driven by a more volatile species other than H<SUB>2</SUB>O, such as CO or CO<SUB>2</SUB>, or by exothermic crystallization of amorphous ice. We derive the radius of the nucleus to be <7 km using the non-detection in 2018 November, and estimate an area of ∼0.5- $10\,{\mathrm{km}}^{2}$ has been active between 2018 December and 2019 September, though this number is model-dependent and is highly uncertain. The behavior of comet Borisov during its inbound leg is observationally consistent with dynamically new comets observed in our solar system, suggesting some similarities between the two.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....159...77Y,[]
"A Twilight Search for Atiras, Vatiras, and Co-orbital Asteroids: Preliminary Results","Near-Earth objects (NEOs) that orbit the Sun on or within Earth's orbit are tricky to detect for Earth-based observers due to their proximity to the Sun in the sky. These small bodies hold clues to the dynamical history of the inner solar system as well as the physical evolution of planetesimals in extreme environments. Populations in this region include the Atira and Vatira asteroids, as well as Venus and Earth co-orbital asteroids. Here we present a twilight search for these small bodies, conducted using the 1.2 m Oschin Schmidt and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) camera at Palomar Observatory. The ZTF twilight survey operates at solar elongations down to 35° with a limiting magnitude of r = 19.5. During a total of 40 evening sessions and 62 morning sessions conducted between 2018 November 15 and 2019 June 23, we detected six Atiras, including two new discoveries, 2019 AQ<SUB>3</SUB> and 2019 LF<SUB>6</SUB>, but no Vatiras or Earth/Venus co-orbital asteroids. NEO population models show that these new discoveries are likely only the tip of the iceberg, with the bulk of the population yet to be found. The population models also suggest that we have only detected 5%-7% of the H < 20 Atira population over the seven month survey. Co-orbital asteroids are smaller in diameter and require deeper surveys. A systematic and efficient survey of the near-Sun region will require deeper searches and/or facilities that can operate at small solar elongations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....159...70Y,[]
ZTF18abhjrcf: The First R Coronae Borealis Star from the Zwicky Transient Facility Public Survey,"R Coronae Borealis stars (RCBs) constitute a rare class of stars that are hydrogen depleted and carbon enriched, possibly from white dwarf mergers. RCBs are identified by their stochastic dimming with photometric variations of as much as eight magnitudes. Hence, the discoveries of RCBs were heavily biased to the limited regions monitored by long-term microlensing experiments. However, recent studies of galactic RCBs have shown that they exhibit distinct mid-infrared colors originating from their cool circumstellar shells. The all-sky Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) survey thus facilitates the identification of RCB candidates. Therefore, combining the WISE colors with large-area time-domain surveys will enable us to discover more RCBs. Here we present the results of a first attempt to identify RCBs in the public Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream, using the alert broker ANTARES. We identify a candidate RCB using the infrared color selection by Tisserand et al. and large light curve variations in the optical from ZTF. We then conduct subsequent observations using the FLOYDS spectrograph at the Las Cumbres Observatory and confirm ZTF18abhjrcf as a bona fide RCB. This demonstrates the potential to discover uncharted RCBs as ZTF and other time-domain surveys continue to operate.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....159...61L,[]
"Gravity and limb-darkening coefficients for compact stars: DA, DB, and DBA eclipsing white dwarfs","Context. The distribution of the specific intensity over the stellar disk is an essential tool for modeling the light curves in eclipsing binaries, planetary transits, and stellar diameters through interferometric techniques, line profiles in rotating stars, gravitational microlensing, etc. However, the available theoretical calculations are mostly restricted to stars on the main sequence or the giant branch, and very few calculations are available for compact stars.",,[]

MAXIMASK and MAXITRACK: Two new tools for identifying contaminants in astronomical images using convolutional neural networks,"In this work, we propose two convolutional neural network classifiers for detecting contaminants in astronomical images. Once trained, our classifiers are able to identify various contaminants, such as cosmic rays, hot and bad pixels, persistence effects, satellite or plane trails, residual fringe patterns, nebulous features, saturated pixels, diffraction spikes, and tracking errors in images. They encompass a broad range of ambient conditions, such as seeing, image sampling, detector type, optics, and stellar density. The first classifier, MAXIMASK, performs semantic segmentation and generates bad pixel maps for each contaminant, based on the probability that each pixel belongs to a given contaminant class. The second classifier, MAXITRACK, classifies entire images and mosaics, by computing the probability for the focal plane to be affected by tracking errors. We gathered training and testing data from real data originating from various modern charged-coupled devices and near-infrared cameras, that are augmented with image simulations. We quantified the performance of both classifiers and show that MAXIMASK achieves state-of-the-art performance for the identification of cosmic ray hits. Thanks to a built-in Bayesian update mechanism, both classifiers can be tuned to meet specific science goals in various observational contexts.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A&A...634A..48P,[]
Web application for galaxy-targeted follow-up of electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave sources,"The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo Collaboration's Observing Run 3 has demanded the development of widely-applicable tools for gravitational wave follow-up.

To address these challenges, we present a public web interface to assist astronomers in conducting galaxy-targeted follow-up of gravitational wave events by offering a fast and public list of targets post-gravitational wave trigger. After a gravitational wave trigger, the back-end galaxy retrieval algorithm identifies and scores galaxies based on the LIGO and Virgo computed probabilities and properties of the galaxies taken from the Galaxy List for the Advanced Detector Era V2 galaxy catalogue. Within minutes, the user can retrieve, download, and limit ranked galaxy lists from the web application.

A search for the origin of the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov,"The discovery of the second interstellar object 2I/Borisov on 2019 August 30 raises the question of whether it was ejected recently from a nearby stellar system. Here we compute the asymptotic incoming trajectory of 2I/Borisov, based on both recent and pre-discovery data extending back to December 2018, using a range of force models that account for cometary outgassing. From Gaia DR2 astrometry and radial velocities, we trace back in time the Galactic orbits of 7.4 million stars to look for close encounters with 2I/Borisov. The closest encounter we find took place 910 kyr ago with the M0V star Ross 573, at a separation of 0.068 pc (90% confidence interval of 0.053-0.091 pc) with a relative velocity of 23 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. This encounter is nine times closer than the closest past encounter identified for the first interstellar object 1I/`Oumuamua. Ejection of 2I/Borisov via a three-body encounter in a binary or planetary system is possible, although such a large ejection velocity is unlikely to be obtained and Ross 573 shows no signs of binarity. We also identify and discuss some other recent close encounters, recognizing that if 2I/Borisov is more than about 10 Myr old, our search would be unlikely to find its parent system.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A&A...634A..14B,[]
Complementarity of peculiar velocity surveys and redshift space distortions for testing gravity,"Peculiar-velocity surveys of the low-redshift universe have significant leverage to constrain the growth rate of cosmic structure and test gravity. Wide-field imaging surveys combined with multiobject spectrographs [e.g., ZTF2, Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), DESI, and 4MOST] can use type Ia supernovae as informative tracers of the velocity field, reaching few percent constraints on the growth rate f σ<SUB>8</SUB> at z ≲0.2 where density tracers cannot do better than ∼10 %. Combining the high-redshift DESI survey mapping redshift space distortions with a low-redshift supernova peculiar velocity survey using LSST and DESI can determine the gravitational growth index to σ (γ )≈0.02 , testing general relativity. We study the characteristics needed for the peculiar velocity survey, and how its complementarity with clustering surveys improves when going from a Λ CDM model assumption to a w<SUB>0</SUB>- w<SUB>a</SUB> cosmology.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhRvD.101b3516K,[]
A systematic study of spiral density waves in the accretion discs of cataclysmic variables,"Spiral density waves are thought to be excited in the accretion discs of accreting compact objects, including cataclysmic variable stars (CVs). Observational evidence has been obtained for a handful of systems in outburst over the last two decades. We present the results of a systematic study searching for spiral density waves in CVs, and report their detection in two of the sixteen observed systems. While most of the systems observed present asymmetric, non-Keplerian accretion discs during outburst, the presence of ordered structures interpreted as spiral density waves is not as ubiquitous as previously anticipated. From a comparison of systems by their system parameters it appears that inclination of the systems may play a major role, favouring the visibility and/or detection of spiral waves in systems seen at high inclination.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491.2217R,[]
Polarimetry of relativistic tidal disruption event Swift J2058+0516,"A small fraction of candidate tidal disruption events (TDEs) show evidence of powerful relativistic jets, which are particularly pronounced at radio wavelengths, and likely contribute non-thermal emission at a wide range of wavelengths. A non-thermal emission component can be diagnosed using linear polarimetry, even when the total received light is dominated by emission from an accretion disc or disc outflow. In this paper, we present Very Large Telescope (VLT) measurements of the linear polarization of the optical light of jetted TDE Swift J2058+0516. This is the second jetted TDE studied in this manner, after Swift J1644+57. We find evidence of non-zero optical linear polarization, P<SUB>V</SUB>∼ 8 per cent, a level very similar to the near-infrared polarimetry of Swift J1644+57. These detections provide an independent test of the emission mechanisms of the multiwavelength emission of jetted TDEs.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491.1771W,[]
Detecting gravitational self-lensing from stellar-mass binaries composed of black holes or neutron stars,"We explore a unique electromagnetic signature of stellar-mass compact-object binaries long before they are detectable in gravitational waves. We show that gravitational lensing of light emitting components of a compact-object binary, by the other binary component, could be detectable in the nearby Universe. This periodic lensing signature could be detected from present and future X-ray observations, identifying the progenitors of binaries that merge in the LIGO band, and also unveiling populations that do not merge, thus providing a tracer of the compact-object binary population in an enigmatic portion of its life. We argue that periodically repeating lensing flares could be observed for ≲100 ks orbital-period binaries with the future Lynx X-ray mission, possibly concurrent with gravitational wave emission in the LISA band. Binaries with longer orbital periods could be more common and be detectable as single lensing flares, though with reliance on a model for the flare that can be tested by observations of succeeding flares. Non-detection of such events, even with existing X-ray observations, will help to constrain the population of EM bright compact-object binaries.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491.1506D,[]
Prospects of cosmic superstring detection through microlensing of extragalactic point-like sources,"The existence of cosmic superstrings may be probed by astronomical time domain surveys. When crossing the line of sight to point-like sources, strings produce a distinctive microlensing signature. We consider two avenues to hunt for a relic population of superstring loops: frequent monitoring of (1) stars in Andromeda, lensed by loops in the haloes of the Milky-Way and Andromeda and (2) supernovae at cosmological distances, lensed by loops in the intergalactic medium. We assess the potential of such experiments to detect and/or constrain strings with a range of tensions, 10<SUP>-15</SUP> ≲ Gμ/c<SUP>2</SUP> ≲ 10<SUP>-6</SUP>. The practical sensitivity is tied to cadence of observations which we explore in detail. We forecast that high-cadence monitoring of ∼10<SUP>5</SUP> stars on the far side of Andromeda over a year-long period will detect microlensing events if Gμ/c<SUP>2</SUP> ∼ 10<SUP>-13</SUP>, while ∼10<SUP>6</SUP> stars will detect events if 10<SUP>-13.5</SUP> < Gμ/c<SUP>2</SUP> < 10<SUP>-11.5</SUP>; the upper and lower bounds of the accessible tension range continue to expand as the number of stars rises. We also analyse the ability to reject models in the absence of fluctuations. While challenging, these studies are within reach of forthcoming time-domain surveys. Supernova observations can hypothetically constrain models with 10<SUP>-12</SUP> < Gμ/c<SUP>2</SUP> < 10<SUP>-6</SUP> without any optimization of the survey cadence. However, the event rate forecast suggests it will be difficult to reject models of interest. As a demonstration, we use observations from the Pantheon Type Ia supernova cosmology data set to place modest constraints on the number density of cosmic superstrings in a poorly tested region of the parameter space.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491..596C,[]
Robotilter: an automated lens/CCD alignment system for the Evryscope,"Camera lenses are increasingly used in wide-field astronomical surveys due to their high performance, wide field-of-view (FOV) unreachable from traditional telescope optics, and modest cost. The machining and assembly tolerances for commercially available optical systems cause a slight misalignment (tilt) between the lens and CCD, resulting in point spread function (PSF) degradation. We have built an automated alignment system (Robotilters) to solve this challenge, optimizing four degrees of freedom—two tilt axes, a separation axis (the distance between the CCD and lens), and the lens focus (the built-in focus of the lens by turning the lens focusing ring, which moves the optical elements relative to one another) in a compact and low-cost package. The Robotilters remove tilt and optimize focus at the sub-10-μm level, are completely automated, take ≈2 h to run, and remain stable for multiple years once aligned. The Robotilters were built for the Evryscope telescope (a 780-MPix 22-camera array with an 8150-sq. deg FOV and continuous 2-min cadence) designed to detect short-timescale events across extremely large sky areas simultaneously. Variance in quality across the image field, especially the corners and edges compared to the center, is a significant challenge in wide-field astronomical surveys like the Evryscope. The individual star PSFs (which typically extend only a few pixels) are highly susceptible to slight increases in optical aberrations in this situation. The Robotilter solution resulted in a limiting magnitude improvement of 0.5 mag in the center of the image and 1.0 mag in the corners for typical Evryscope cameras, with less distorted and smaller PSFs (half the extent in the corners and edges in many cases). We describe the Robotilter mechanical and software design, camera alignment results, long-term stability, and image improvement. The potential for general use in wide-field astronomical surveys is also explored.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020JATIS...6a8002R,[]
The Most Rapidly Declining Type I Supernova 2019bkc/ATLAS19dqr,"We report observations of the hydrogen-deficient supernova (SN) 2019bkc/ATLAS19dqr. With B- and r-band decline between peak and 10 days post peak of ${\rm{\Delta }}{m}_{10}(B)=5.24\pm 0.07$ mag and ${\rm{\Delta }}{m}_{10}(r)=3.85\pm 0.10$ mag, respectively, SN 2019bkc is the most rapidly declining SN I discovered so far. While its closest matches are the rapidly declining SN 2005ek and SN 2010X, the light curves and spectra of SN 2019bkc show some unprecedented characteristics. SN 2019bkc appears ""hostless,"" with no identifiable host galaxy near its location, although it may be associated with the galaxy cluster MKW1 at z = 0.02. We evaluate a number of existing models of fast-evolving SNe, and we find that none of them can satisfactorily explain all aspects of SN 2019bkc observations.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...889L...6C,[]
The ELM Survey. VIII. Ninety-eight Double White Dwarf Binaries,"We present the final sample of 98 detached double white dwarf (WD) binaries found in the Extremely Low Mass (ELM) Survey, a spectroscopic survey targeting <0.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> He-core WDs completed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey footprint. Over the course of the survey we observed ancillary low-mass WD candidates like GD 278, which we show is a P = 0.19 day double WD binary, as well as candidates that turn out to be field blue straggler/subdwarf A-type stars with luminosities too high to be WDs given their Gaia parallaxes. Here, we define a clean sample of ELM WDs that is complete within our target selection and magnitude range 15 < g<SUB>0</SUB> < 20 mag. The measurements are consistent with 100% of ELM WDs being 0.0089 < P < 1.5 day double WD binaries, 35% of which belong to the Galactic halo. We infer that these are mostly He+CO WD binaries given the measurement constraints. The merger rate of the observed He+CO WD binaries exceeds the formation rate of stable mass-transfer AM CVn binaries by a factor of 25, and so the majority of He+CO WD binaries must experience unstable mass transfer and merge. The systems with the shortest periods, such as J0651+2844, are signature LISA verification binaries that can be studied with gravitational waves and light.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...889...49B,[]
An Optimized Radio Follow-up Strategy for Stripped-envelope Core-collapse Supernovae,"Several ongoing or planned synoptic optical surveys are offering, or will soon be offering, an unprecedented opportunity for discovering larger samples of the rarest types of stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae, such as those associated with relativistic jets, mildly relativistic ejecta, or strong interaction with the circumstellar medium. Observations at radio wavelengths are a useful tool to probe the fastest moving ejecta, as well as denser circumstellar environments, and can thus help us identify the rarest type of core-collapse explosions. Here, we discuss how to set up an efficient radio follow-up program to detect and correctly identify radio-emitting stripped-envelope core-collapse explosions. We use a method similar to the one described in Carbone & Corsi, and determine the optimal timing of GHz radio observations assuming a sensitivity comparable to that of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. The optimization is done so as to ensure that the collected radio observations can identify the type of explosion powering the radio counterpart by using the smallest possible amount of telescope time. We also present a previously unpublished upper limit on the late-time radio emission from supernova iPTF 17cw. Finally, we conclude by discussing implications for follow-up in the X-rays.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...889...36C,[]
On Post-starburst Galaxies Dominating Tidal Disruption Events,"A starburst induced by a galaxy merger may create a relatively thin central stellar disk at radius ≤100 pc. We calculate the rate of tidal disruption events (TDEs) by the inspiraling secondary supermassive black hole (SMBH) through the disk. With a small enough stellar velocity dispersion (σ /{V}<SUB>c</SUB>≤slant 0.1) in the disk, it is shown that 10<SUP>5</SUP>-10<SUP>6</SUP> TDEs of solar-type main-sequence stars per post-starburst galaxy (PSB) can be produced to explain their dominance in producing observed TDEs. Although the time it takes to bring the secondary SMBH to the disk apparently varies in the range of ∼0.1-1 Gyr since the starburst, depending on its landing location and subsequently due to dynamical friction with stars exterior to the central stellar disk in question, the vast majority of TDEs by the secondary SMBH in any individual PSB occur within a time span shorter than ∼30 Myr. Five unique testable predictions of this model are suggested.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...888L..14C,[]
An Information Theory Approach on Deciding Spectroscopic Follow-ups,"Classification and characterization of variable phenomena and transient phenomena are critical for astrophysics and cosmology. These objects are commonly studied using photometric time series or spectroscopic data. Given that many ongoing and future surveys are conducted in a time domain, and given that adding spectra provides further insights but requires more observational resources, it would be valuable to know which objects we should prioritize to have a spectrum in addition to a time series. We propose a methodology in a probabilistic setting that determines a priori which objects are worth taking a spectrum of to obtain better insights, where we focus on the insight of the type of the object (classification). Objects for which we query their spectrum are reclassified using their full spectral information. We first train two classifiers, one that uses photometric data and another that uses photometric and spectroscopic data together. Then for each photometric object we estimate the probability of each possible spectrum outcome. We combine these models in various probabilistic frameworks (strategies), which are used to guide the selection of follow-up observations. The best strategy depends on the intended use, whether it is obtaining more confidence or accuracy. For a given number of candidate objects (127, equal to 5% of the data set) for taking spectra, we improve the class prediction accuracy by 37% as opposed to 20% of a non-naive (non-random) best-baseline strategy. Our approach provides a general framework for follow-up strategies and can be extended beyond classification to include other forms of follow-ups beyond spectroscopy.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....159...16A,[]
The Vanishing and Appearing Sources during a Century of Observations Project. I. USNO Objects Missing in Modern Sky Surveys and Follow-up Observations of a “Missing Star”,"In this paper we report the current status of a new research program. The primary goal of the “Vanishing and Appearing Sources during a Century of Observations” project is to search for vanishing and appearing sources using existing survey data to find examples of exceptional astrophysical transients. The implications of finding such objects extend from traditional astrophysics fields to the more exotic searches for evidence of technologically advanced civilizations. In this first paper we present new, deeper observations of the tentative candidate discovered by Villarroel et al. in 2016. We then perform the first searches for vanishing objects throughout the sky by comparing 600 million objects from the US Naval Observatory Catalogue (USNO) B1.0 down to a limiting magnitude of ∼20-21 with the recent Pan-STARRS Data Release-1 (DR1) with a limiting magnitude of ∼23.4. We find about 150,000 preliminary candidates that do not have any Pan-STARRS counterpart within a 30″ radius. We show that these objects are redder and have larger proper motions than typical USNO objects. We visually examine the images for a subset of about 24,000 candidates, superseding the 2016 study with a sample 10 times larger. We find about 100 point sources visible in only one epoch in the red band of the USNO, which may be of interest in searches for strong M-dwarf flares, high-redshift supernovae, or other categories of unidentified red transients.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....159....8V,[]
Full orbital solution for the binary system in the northern Galactic disc microlensing event Gaia16aye,"Gaia16aye was a binary microlensing event discovered in the direction towards the northern Galactic disc and was one of the first microlensing events detected and alerted to by the Gaia space mission. Its light curve exhibited five distinct brightening episodes, reaching up to I = 12 mag, and it was covered in great detail with almost 25 000 data points gathered by a network of telescopes. We present the photometric and spectroscopic follow-up covering 500 days of the event evolution. We employed a full Keplerian binary orbit microlensing model combined with the motion of Earth and Gaia around the Sun to reproduce the complex light curve. The photometric data allowed us to solve the microlensing event entirely and to derive the complete and unique set of orbital parameters of the binary lensing system. We also report on the detection of the first-ever microlensing space-parallax between the Earth and Gaia located at L2. The properties of the binary system were derived from microlensing parameters, and we found that the system is composed of two main-sequence stars with masses 0.57 ± 0.05 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and 0.36 ± 0.03 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> at 780 pc, with an orbital period of 2.88 years and an eccentricity of 0.30. We also predict the astrometric microlensing signal for this binary lens as it will be seen by Gaia as well as the radial velocity curve for the binary system. Events such as Gaia16aye indicate the potential for the microlensing method of probing the mass function of dark objects, including black holes, in directions other than that of the Galactic bulge. This case also emphasises the importance of long-term time-domain coordinated observations that can be made with a network of heterogeneous telescopes.",,[]
