Jets from Tidal Disruption Events;;The discovery of jets from tidal disruption events (TDEs) rejuvenated the old field of relativistic jets powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes. In this Chapter, we first review the extensive multi-wavelength observations of jetted TDEs. Then, we show that these events provide valuable information on many aspects of jet physics from a new prospective, including the on-and-off switch of jet launching, jet propagation through the ambient medium, γ/X-ray radiation mechanism, jet composition, and the multi-messenger picture. Finally, open questions and future prospects in this field are summarized.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020NewAR..8901538D
On the cosmological performance of photometrically classified supernovae with machine learning;;The efficient classification of different types of supernovae is one of the most important problems for observational cosmology. However, spectroscopic confirmation of most objects in upcoming photometric surveys, such as the the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, will be unfeasible. The development of automated classification processes based on photometry has thus become crucial. In this paper, we investigate the performance of machine learning (ML) classification on the final cosmological constraints using simulated light-curves from the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge, released in 2010. We study the use of different feature sets for the light-curves and many different ML pipelines based on either decision-tree ensembles or automated search processes. To construct the final catalogues we propose a threshold selection method, by employing a bias-variance tradeoff. This is a very robust and efficient way to minimize the mean squared error. With this method, we were able to obtain very strong cosmological constraints, which allowed us to keep $\sim 75{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the total information in the Type Ia supernovae when using the SALT2 feature set, and $\sim 33{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ for the other cases (based either on the Newling model or on standard wavelet decomposition).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.2974V
Vetting the optical transient candidates detected by the GWAC network using convolutional neural networks;;The observation of the transient sky through a multitude of astrophysical messengers has led to several scientific breakthroughs in the last two decades, thanks to the fast evolution of the observational techniques and strategies employed by the astronomers. Now, it requires to be able to coordinate multiwavelength and multimessenger follow-up campaigns with instruments both in space and on ground jointly capable of scanning a large fraction of the sky with a high-imaging cadency and duty cycle. In the optical domain, the key challenge of the wide field-of-view telescopes covering tens to hundreds of square degrees is to deal with the detection, identification, and classification of hundreds to thousands of optical transient (OT) candidates every night in a reasonable amount of time. In the last decade, new automated tools based on machine learning approaches have been developed to perform those tasks with a low computing time and a high classification efficiency. In this paper, we present an efficient classification method using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to discard many common types of bogus falsely detected in astrophysical images in the optical domain. We designed this tool to improve the performances of the OT detection pipeline of the Ground Wide field Angle Cameras (GWAC) telescopes, a network of robotic telescopes aiming at monitoring the OT sky down to R = 16 with a 15 s imaging cadency. We applied our trained CNN classifier on a sample of 1472 GWAC OT candidates detected by the real-time detection pipeline.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.2641T
Using machine learning for transient classification in searches for gravitational-wave counterparts;;The large sky localization regions offered by the gravitational-wave interferometers require efficient follow-up of the many counterpart candidates identified by the wide field-of-view telescopes. Given the restricted telescope time, the creation of prioritized lists of the many identified candidates becomes mandatory. Towards this end, we use astrorapid, a multiband photometric light-curve classifier, to differentiate between kilonovae, supernovae, and other possible transients. We demonstrate our method on the photometric observations of real events. In addition, the classification performance is tested on simulated light curves, both ideally and realistically sampled. We show that after only a few days of observations of an astronomical object, it is possible to rule out candidates as supernovae and other known transients.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.1320S
Implications of the search for optical counterparts during the second part of the Advanced LIGO's and Advanced Virgo's third observing run: lessons learned for future follow-up observations;;Joint multimessenger observations with gravitational waves and electromagnetic (EM) data offer new insights into the astrophysical studies of compact objects. The third Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo observing run began on 2019 April 1; during the 11 months of observation, there have been 14 compact binary systems candidates for which at least one component is potentially a neutron star. Although intensive follow-up campaigns involving tens of ground and space-based observatories searched for counterparts, no EM counterpart has been detected. Following on a previous study of the first six months of the campaign, we present in this paper the next five months of the campaign from 2019 October to 2020 March. We highlight two neutron star-black hole candidates (S191205ah and S200105ae), two binary neutron star candidates (S191213g and S200213t), and a binary merger with a possible neutron star and a 'MassGap' component, S200115j. Assuming that the gravitational-wave (GW) candidates are of astrophysical origin and their location was covered by optical telescopes, we derive possible constraints on the matter ejected during the events based on the non-detection of counterparts. We find that the follow-up observations during the second half of the third observing run did not meet the necessary sensitivity to constrain the source properties of the potential GW candidate. Consequently, we suggest that different strategies have to be used to allow a better usage of the available telescope time. We examine different choices for follow-up surveys to optimize sky localization coverage versus observational depth to understand the likelihood of counterpart detection.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497.1181C
Searching for electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational-wave merger events with the prototype Gravitational-Wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO-4);;We report the results of optical follow-up observations of 29 gravitational-wave (GW) triggers during the first half of the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration (LVC) O3 run with the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) in its prototype 4-telescope configuration (GOTO-4). While no viable electromagnetic (EM) counterpart candidate was identified, we estimate our 3D (volumetric) coverage using test light curves of on- and off-axis gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae. In cases where the source region was observable immediately, GOTO-4 was able to respond to a GW alert in less than a minute. The average time of first observation was 8.79 h after receiving an alert (9.90 h after trigger). A mean of 732.3 square degrees were tiled per event, representing on average 45.3 per cent of the LVC probability map, or 70.3 per cent of the observable probability. This coverage will further improve as the facility scales up alongside the localization performance of the evolving GW detector network. Even in its 4-telescope prototype configuration, GOTO is capable of detecting AT2017gfo-like kilonovae beyond 200 Mpc in favourable observing conditions. We cannot currently place meaningful EM limits on the population of distant ( $\hat{D}_L = 1.3$ Gpc) binary black hole mergers because our test models are too faint to recover at this distance. However, as GOTO is upgraded towards its full 32-telescope, 2 node (La Palma & Australia) configuration, it is expected to be sufficiently sensitive to cover the predicted O4 binary neutron star merger volume, and will be able to respond to both northern and southern triggers.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497..726G
SN 2018hti: a nearby superluminous supernova discovered in a metal-poor galaxy;;SN 2018hti is a Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN I) with an absolute g-band magnitude of -22.2 at maximum brightness, discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System in a metal-poor galaxy at a redshift of 0.0612. We present extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of this supernova, covering the phases from ∼-35 d to more than +340 d from the r-band maximum. Combining our BVgri-band photometry with Swift UVOT optical/ultraviolet photometry, we calculated the peak luminosity as ∼3.5 × 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Modelling the observed light curve reveals that the luminosity evolution of SN 2018hti can be produced by an ejecta mass of 5.8 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a magnetar with a magnetic field of B = 1.8 × 10<SUP>13</SUP> G having an initial spin period of P<SUB>0</SUB> = 1.8 ms. Based on such a magnetar-powered scenario and a larger sample, a correlation between the spin of the magnetar and the kinetic energy of the ejecta can be inferred for most SLSNe I, suggesting a self-consistent scenario. Like for other SLSNe I, the host galaxy of SN 2018hti is found to be relatively faint (M<SUB>g</SUB> = -17.75 mag) and of low metallicity (Z = 0.3 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>), with a star formation rate of 0.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. According to simulation results of single-star evolution, SN 2018hti could originate from a massive, metal-poor star with a zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass of 25-40 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, or from a less massive rotating star with M<SUB>ZAMS</SUB> ≈ 16-25 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. For the case of a binary system, its progenitor could also be a star with $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} rsim 25\, \mathrm{ M}_\odot$ .;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497..318L
AT2018kzr: the merger of an oxygen-neon white dwarf and a neutron star or black hole;;We present detailed spectroscopic analysis of the extraordinarily fast-evolving transient AT2018kzr. The transient's observed light curve showed a rapid decline rate, comparable to the kilonova AT2017gfo. We calculate a self-consistent sequence of radiative transfer models (using TARDIS) and determine that the ejecta material is dominated by intermediate-mass elements (O, Mg, and Si), with a photospheric velocity of ~12 000-14 500 $\rm {km}\, s^{-1}$. The early spectra have the unusual combination of being blue but dominated by strong Fe II and Fe III absorption features. We show that this combination is only possible with a high Fe content (3.5 per cent). This implies a high Fe/(Ni+Co) ratio. Given the short time from the transient's proposed explosion epoch, the Fe cannot be <SUP>56</SUP>Fe resulting from the decay of radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni synthesized in the explosion. Instead, we propose that this is stable <SUP>54</SUP>Fe, and that the transient is unusually rich in this isotope. We further identify an additional, high-velocity component of ejecta material at ~20 000-26 000 $\rm {km}\, s^{-1}$, which is mildly asymmetric and detectable through the Ca II near-infrared triplet. We discuss our findings with reference to a range of plausible progenitor systems and compare with published theoretical work. We conclude that AT2018kzr is most likely the result of a merger between an ONe white dwarf and a neutron star or black hole. As such, it would be the second plausible candidate with a good spectral sequence for the electromagnetic counterpart of a compact binary merger, after AT2017gfo.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.497..246G
Comprehensive Analysis of the Tidal Effect in Gravitational Waves and Implication for Cosmology;;Detection of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by coalescence of compact binaries provides a novel way to measure the luminosity distance of GW events. Combining their redshift, they can act as standard sirens to constrain cosmological parameters. For various GW detector networks in second-generation (2G), 2.5G, and 3G, we comprehensively analyze the method to constrain the equation-of-state (EOS) of binary neutron stars (BNSs) and extract their redshifts through the imprints of tidal effects in GW waveforms. We find for these events that the observations of electromagnetic counterparts in the low-redshift range z < 0.1 are important for constraining the tidal effects. Considering 17 different EOSs of NSs or quark stars, we find GW observations have strong capability to determine the EOS. Applying the events as standard sirens, and considering the constraints of NS's EOS derived from low-redshift observations as prior, we can constrain the dark energy EOS parameters w<SUB>0</SUB> and w<SUB>a</SUB>. In the 3G era, the potential constraints are Δw<SUB>0</SUB> ∈ (0.0006,0.004) and Δw<SUB>a</SUB> ∈ (0.004,0.02), which are 1-3 orders smaller than those from traditional methods, including Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and baryon acoustic oscillations. The constraints are also made 1 order smaller than the method of GW standard siren by fixing the redshifts through short-hard γ-ray bursts, due to more available GW events in this method. Therefore, GW standard sirens, based on the tidal effect measurement, provide a realizable and much more powerful tool in cosmology.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJS..250....6W
Four (Super)luminous Supernovae from the First Months of the ZTF Survey;;We present photometry and spectroscopy of four hydrogen-poor luminous supernovae discovered during the 2-month long science commissioning and early operations of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey. Three of these objects, SN 2018bym (ZTF18aapgrxo), SN 2018avk (ZTF18aaisyyp), and SN 2018bgv (ZTF18aavrmcg), resemble typical SLSN-I spectroscopically, while SN 2018don (ZTF18aajqcue) may be an object similar to SN 2007bi experiencing considerable host galaxy reddening, or an intrinsically long-lived, luminous, and red SN Ic. We analyze the light curves, spectra, and host galaxy properties of these four objects and put them in context of the population of SLSN-I. SN 2018bgv stands out as the fastest-rising SLSN-I observed to date, with a rest-frame g-band rise time of just 10 days from explosion to peak—if it is powered by magnetar spin-down, the implied ejecta mass is only ≃1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. SN 2018don also displays unusual properties—in addition to its red colors and comparatively massive host galaxy, the light curve undergoes some of the strongest light-curve undulations postpeak seen in an SLSN-I, which we speculate may be due to interaction with circumstellar material. We discuss the promises and challenges of finding SLSNe in large-scale surveys like ZTF given the observed diversity in the population.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...901...61L
Characterization of Temporarily Captured Minimoon 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB> by Keck Time-resolved Spectrophotometry;;We present time-resolved visible spectrophotometry of 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB>, the second known minimoon. The spectrophotometry was taken with the Keck I/Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer between wavelengths 434 and 912 nm in the B, g, V, R, I, and RG850 filters as it was leaving the Earth-Moon system on 2020 March 23 UTC. The spectrum of 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB> resembles V-type asteroids and some lunar rock samples with a 434-761 nm reddish slope of ∼18%/100 nm (g-r = 0.62 ± 0.08 and r-i = 0.21 ± 0.06) with an absorption band at ∼900 nm corresponding to i-z = -0.54 ± 0.10. Combining our measured H of 31.9 ± 0.1 with an albedo of 0.35 typical for V-type asteroids, we determine 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB>'s diameter to be ∼0.9 ± 0.1 m, making it the first minimoon and one of the smallest asteroids to be spectrally studied. We use our time-series photometry to detect significant periodic light-curve variations with a period of ∼573 s and amplitude of ∼1. In addition, we extend the observational arc of 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB> to 37 days, to 2020 March 23 UTC. From the improved orbital solution for 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB>, we estimate the likely duration of its capture to be ∼2 yr and the nongravitational perturbation on its orbit due to radiation pressure with an area-to-mass ratio of (6.9 ± 2.4) × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> kg<SUP>-1</SUP> implying a density of 2.3 ± 0.8 g cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, broadly compatible with other meter-scale asteroids and lunar rock. We searched for prediscovery detections of 2020 CD<SUB>3</SUB> in the Zwicky Transient Facility archive as far back as 2018 October but were unable to locate any positive detections.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...900L..45B
A Year-long Superoutburst from an Ultracompact White Dwarf Binary Reveals the Importance of Donor Star Irradiation;;SDSS J080710+485259 is the longest-period outbursting ultracompact white dwarf binary. Its first-ever detected superoutburst started in 2018 November and lasted for a year, the longest detected so far for any short orbital period accreting white dwarf. Here we show the superoutburst duration of SDSS J080710+485259 exceeds the ∼2 month viscous time of its accretion disk by a factor of about 5. Consequently it follows that neither the empirical relation nor the theoretical relation between the orbital period and the superoutburst duration for AM CVn systems. Six months after the end of the superoutburst the binary remained 0.4 mag brighter than its quiescent level before the superoutburst. We detect a variable X-ray behavior during the post-outburst cooling phase, demonstrating changes in the mass accretion rate. We discuss how irradiation of the donor star, a scenario poorly explored so far and that ultimately can have important consequences for AM CVns as gravitational-wave sources, might explain the unusual observed features of the superoutburst.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...900L..37R
Strong Calcium Emission Indicates that the Ultraviolet-flashing SN Ia 2019yvq Was the Result of a Sub-Chandrasekar-mass Double-detonation Explosion;;We present nebular spectra of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2019yvq, which had a bright flash of blue and ultraviolet light after exploding, followed by a rise similar to other SNe Ia. Although SN 2019yvq displayed several other rare characteristics, such as persistent high ejecta velocity near peak brightness, it was not especially peculiar, and if the early "excess" emission were not observed, it would likely be included in cosmological samples. The excess flux can be explained by several different physical models linked to the details of the progenitor system and explosion mechanism. Each has unique predictions for the optically thin emission at late times. In our nebular spectra, we detect strong [Ca II] λλ7291, 7324 and Ca near-IR triplet emission, consistent with a double-detonation explosion. We do not detect H, He, or [O I] emission, predictions for some single-degenerate progenitor systems and violent white dwarf mergers. The amount of swept-up H or He is <2.8 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> and 2.4 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, respectively. Aside from strong Ca emission, the SN 2019yvq nebular spectrum is similar to those of typical SNe Ia with the same light-curve shape. Comparing to double-detonation models, we find that the Ca emission is consistent with a model with a total progenitor mass of 1.15 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. However, we note that a lower progenitor mass better explains the early light-curve and peak luminosity. The unique properties of SN 2019yvq suggest that thick He-shell double detonations only account for ${1.1}_{-1.1}^{+2.1} \% $ of the total "normal" SN Ia rate. The SN 2019yvq is one of the best examples yet that multiple progenitor channels appear necessary to reproduce the full diversity of "normal" SNe Ia.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...900L..27S
Comparative Spectral Analysis of the Superluminous Supernova 2019neq;;We present a spectroscopic analysis of the recently discovered fast-evolving Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) SN 2019neq (at redshift z = 0.1059). We compare it to the well-studied slowly evolving SLSN-I SN 2010kd (z = 0.101). Our main goal is to search for spectroscopic differences between the two groups of SLSNe-I. Differences in the spectra may reveal different ejecta compositions and explosion mechanisms. Our investigation concentrates on optical spectra observed with the 10 m Hobby-Eberly Telescope Low Resolution Spectrograph-2 at McDonald Observatory during the photospheric phase. We apply the SYN++ code to model the spectra of SN 2019neq taken at -4 days, +5 days, and +29 days from maximum light. We examine the chemical evolution and ejecta composition of the SLSN by identifying the elements and ionization states in its spectra. We find that a spectral model consisting of O III, Co III, and Si IV gives a SYN++ fit that is comparable to the typical SLSN-I spectral model consisting of O II, and conclude that the true identification of those lines, at least in the case of SN 2019neq, is ambiguous. Based on modeling the entire optical spectrum, we classify SN 2019neq as a fast-evolving SLSN-I having a photospheric velocity gradient of $\dot{v}\sim 375$ km s<SUP>-1</SUP> day<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is among the highest velocity gradients observed for an SLSN-I. Inferring the velocity gradient from the proposed Fe II λ5169 feature alone would result in $\dot{v}\sim 100$ km s<SUP>-1</SUP> day<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is still within the observed range of fast-evolving SLSNe-I. In addition, we derive the number density of relevant ionization states for a variety of identified elements at the epoch of the three observations. Finally, we give constraints on the lower limit of the ejecta mass and find that both SLSNe have an ejecta mass at least one order of magnitude higher than normal SNe Ia, while the fast-evolving SN 2019neq has an ejecta mass a factor of two lower than the slowly evolving SN 2010kd. These mass estimates suggest the existence of a possible correlation between the evolution timescale and the ejected mass of SLSNe-I.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...900...73K
Dust Reverberation Mapping in Distant Quasars from Optical and Mid-infrared Imaging Surveys;;The size of the dust torus in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and their high-luminosity counterparts, quasars, can be inferred from the time delay between UV/optical accretion disk continuum variability and the response in the mid-infrared (MIR) torus emission. This dust reverberation mapping (RM) technique has been successfully applied to ∼70 z ≲ 0.3 AGNs and quasars. Here we present first results of our dust RM program for distant quasars covered in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 region combining ∼20 yr ground-based optical light curves with 10 yr MIR light curves from the WISE satellite. We measure a high-fidelity lag between W1 band (3.4 μm) and g band for 587 quasars over 0.3 ≲ z ≲ 2 ( $\left\langle z\right\rangle \sim 0.8$ ) and two orders of magnitude in quasar luminosity. They tightly follow (intrinsic scatter ∼0.17 dex in lag) the IR lag-luminosity relation observed for z < 0.3 AGNs, revealing a remarkable size-luminosity relation for the dust torus over more than four decades in AGN luminosity, with little dependence on additional quasar properties such as Eddington ratio and variability amplitude. This study motivates further investigations in the utility of dust RM for cosmology and strongly endorses a compelling science case for the combined 10 yr Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (optical) and 5 yr Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope 2 μm light curves in a deep survey for low-redshift AGN dust RM with much lower luminosities and shorter, measurable IR lags. The compiled optical and MIR light curves for 7384 quasars in our parent sample are made public with this work.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...900...58Y
SN2019dge: A Helium-rich Ultra-stripped Envelope Supernova;;We present observations of ZTF18abfcmjw (SN2019dge), a helium-rich supernova with a fast-evolving light curve indicating an extremely low ejecta mass (≈0.33 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) and low kinetic energy (≈1.3 × 10<SUP>50</SUP> erg). Early-time (<4 days after explosion) photometry reveals evidence of shock cooling from an extended helium-rich envelope of ∼0.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> located ∼1.2 × 10<SUP>13</SUP> cm from the progenitor. Early-time He II line emission and subsequent spectra show signatures of interaction with helium-rich circumstellar material, which extends from ≳5 × 10<SUP>13</SUP> cm to ≳2 × 10<SUP>16</SUP> cm. We interpret SN2019dge as a helium-rich supernova from an ultra-stripped progenitor, which originates from a close binary system consisting of a mass-losing helium star and a low-mass main-sequence star or a compact object (i.e., a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole). We infer that the local volumetric birth rate of 19dge-like ultra-stripped SNe is in the range of 1400-8200 $\,{\mathrm{Gpc}}^{-3}\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$ (i.e., 2%-12% of core-collapse supernova rate). This can be compared to the observed coalescence rate of compact neutron star binaries that are not formed by dynamical capture.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...900...46Y
On a century of extragalactic novae and the rise of the rapid recurrent novae;;Novae are the observable outcome of a transient thermonuclear runaway on the surface of an accreting white dwarf in a close binary system. Their high peak luminosity renders them visible in galaxies out beyond the distance of the Virgo Cluster. Over the past century, surveys of extragalactic novae, particularly within the nearby Andromeda Galaxy, have yielded substantial insights regarding the properties of their populations and sub-populations. The recent decade has seen the first detailed panchromatic studies of individual extragalactic novae and the discovery of two probably related sub-groups: the 'faint-fast' and the 'rapid recurrent' novae. In this review we summarise the past 100 years of extragalactic efforts, introduce the rapid recurrent sub-group, and look in detail at the remarkable faint-fast, and rapid recurrent, nova M31N 2008-12a. We end with a brief look forward, not to the next 100 years, but the next few decades, and the study of novae in the upcoming era of wide-field and multi-messenger time-domain surveys.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AdSpR..66.1147D
Insights from multi-wavelength observations during high and low states of non-magnetic CVs;;Close binaries containing a white dwarf accreting from a disk that receives material from a late stellar companion show an interesting variety of behaviors that depend on their accretion rates and the changes in this rate. The highest accretion rates are evident during the bright states of novalikes, as well as the superoutbursts of the shortest period dwarf novae followed by normal outbursts and the Z Cam systems. While the normal outbursts and superoutbursts of dwarf novae can be understood from the standpoint of disk and tidal instabilities, the changes in rates in novalikes when they enter low brightness states and the cause of extremely high rates for the systems with orbital periods between 3 and 4 h remain elusive. This paper highlights some recent insights and continuing problems found from X-ray, UV and optical observations of these high and low states, as well as the prospects for increased understanding from the anticipated future ground and space missions.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AdSpR..66.1090S
Identifying Microlensing Events Using Neural Networks;;Current gravitational microlensing surveys are observing hundreds of millions of stars in the Galactic bulge - which makes finding rare microlensing events a challenging tasks. In almost all previous works, microlensing events have been detected either by applying very strict selection cuts or manually inspecting tens of thousands of light curves. However, the number of microlensing events expected in the future space-based microlensing experiments forces us to consider fully-automated approaches. They are especially important for selecting binary-lens events that often exhibit complex light curve morphologies and are otherwise difficult to find. There are no dedicated selection algorithms for binary-lens events in the literature, which hampers their statistical studies. Here, we present two simple neural-network-based classifiers for detecting single and binary microlensing events. We demonstrate their robustness using OGLE-III and OGLE-IV data sets and show they perform well on microlensing events detected in data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Classifiers are able to correctly recognize ≈98% of single-lens events and 80-85% of binary-lens events.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AcA....70..169M
A Warm Jupiter Transiting an M Dwarf: A TESS Single-transit Event Confirmed with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder;;We confirm the planetary nature of a warm Jupiter transiting the early M dwarf TOI-1899 using a combination of available TESS photometry; high-precision, near-infrared spectroscopy with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder; and speckle and adaptive optics imaging. The data reveal a transiting companion on an ∼29 day orbit with a mass and radius of $0.66\pm 0.07\ {M}_{{\rm{J}}}$ and ${1.15}_{-0.05}^{+0.04}\ {R}_{{\rm{J}}}$ , respectively. The star, TOI-1899, is the lowest-mass star known to host a transiting warm Jupiter, and we discuss the follow-up opportunities afforded by a warm ( ${T}_{\mathrm{eq}}\sim 362$ K) gas giant orbiting an M0 star. Our observations reveal that TOI-1899.01 is a puffy warm Jupiter, and we suggest additional transit observations to both refine the orbit and constrain the true dilution observed in TESS.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160..147C
Design and Operation of the ATLAS Transient Science Server;;The Asteroid Terrestrial impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) system consists of two 0.5 m Schmidt telescopes with cameras covering 29 square degrees at plate scale of 1.86 arcsec per pixel. Working in tandem, the telescopes routinely survey the whole sky visible from Hawaii (above $\delta  -50^\circ $ ) every two nights, exposing four times per night, typically reaching $o 19$ magnitude per exposure when the moon is illuminated and $c 19.5$ magnitude per exposure in dark skies. Construction is underway of two further units to be sited in Chile and South Africa which will result in an all-sky daily cadence from 2021. Initially designed for detecting potentially hazardous near earth objects, the ATLAS data enable a range of astrophysical time domain science. To extract transients from the data stream requires a computing system to process the data, assimilate detections in time and space and associate them with known astrophysical sources. Here we describe the hardware and software infrastructure to produce a stream of clean, real, astrophysical transients in real time. This involves machine learning and boosted decision tree algorithms to identify extragalactic and Galactic transients. Typically we detect 10-15 supernova candidates per night which we immediately announce publicly. The ATLAS discoveries not only enable rapid follow-up of interesting sources but will provide complete statistical samples within the local volume of 100 Mpc. A simple comparison of the detected supernova rate within 100 Mpc, with no corrections for completeness, is already significantly higher (factor 1.5 to 2) than the current accepted rates.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132h5002S
A numerical light curve model for interaction-powered supernovae;;We construct a numerical light curve model for interaction-powered supernovae that arise from an interaction between the ejecta and the circumstellar matter (CSM). In order to resolve the shocked region of an interaction-powered supernova, we solve the fluid equations and radiative transfer equation assuming steady states in the rest frames of the reverse and forward shocks at each time step. Then we numerically solve the radiative transfer equation and the energy equation in the CSM with the radiative flux obtained from the forward shock as a radiation source. We also compare the results of our models with observational data of two supernovae, 2005kj and 2005ip, classified as type IIn, and discuss the validity of our assumptions. We conclude that our model can predict the physical parameters associated with supernova ejecta and the CSM from the observed features of the light curve as long as the CSM is sufficiently dense. Furthermore, we found that the absorption of radiation in the CSM is an important factor in calculating the luminosity.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASJ...72...67T

Progenitor, precursor, and evolution of the dusty remnant of the stellar merger M31-LRN-2015;;M31-LRN-2015 is a likely stellar merger discovered in the Andromeda Galaxy in 2015. We present new optical to mid-infrared photometry and optical spectroscopy for this event. Archival data show that the source started to brighten ~2 yr before the nova event. During this precursor phase, the source brightened by ~3 mag. The light curve at 6 and 1.5 months before the main outburst may show periodicity, with periods of 16 ± 0.3 and 28.1 ± 1.4 d, respectively. This complex emission may be explained by runaway mass-loss from the system after the binary undergoes Roche lobe overflow, leading the system to coalesce in tens of orbital periods. While the progenitor spectral energy distribution shows no evidence of pre-existing warm dust in the system, the remnant forms an optically thick dust shell at approximately four months after the outburst peak. The optical depth of the shell increases dramatically after 1.5 yr, suggesting the existence of shocks that enhance the dust formation process. We propose that the merger remnant is likely an inflated giant obscured by a cooling shell of gas with mass ~0.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> ejected at the onset of the common envelope phase.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.5503B
Non-linear dynamical tides in white dwarf binaries;;Compact white dwarf (WD) binaries are important sources for space-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories, and an increasing number of them are being identified by surveys like Extremely Low Mass (ELM) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We study the effects of non-linear dynamical tides in such binaries. We focus on the global three-mode parametric instability and show that it has a much lower threshold energy than the local wave-breaking condition studied previously. By integrating networks of coupled modes, we calculate the tidal dissipation rate as a function of orbital period. We construct phenomenological models that match these numerical results and use them to evaluate the spin and luminosity evolution of a WD binary. While in linear theory the WD's spin frequency can lock to the orbital frequency, we find that such a lock cannot be maintained when non-linear effects are taken into account. Instead, as the orbit decays, the spin and orbit go in and out of synchronization. Each time they go out of synchronization, there is a brief but significant dip in the tidal heating rate. While most WDs in compact binaries should have luminosities that are similar to previous traveling-wave estimates, a few per cent should be about 10 times dimmer because they reside in heating rate dips. This offers a potential explanation for the low luminosity of the CO WD in J0651. Lastly, we consider the impact of tides on the GW signal and show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and TianGO can constrain the WD's moment of inertia to better than $1{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ for centi-Hz systems.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.5482Y
The dust never settles: collisional production of gas and dust in evolved planetary systems;;Multi-epoch infrared photometry from Spitzer is used to monitor circumstellar discs at white dwarfs, which are consistent with disrupted minor planets whose debris is accreted and chemically reflected by their host stars. Widespread infrared variability is found across the population of 37 stars with two or more epochs. Larger flux changes occur on longer time-scales, reaching several tens of per cent over baselines of a few years. The canonical model of a geometrically thin, optically thick disc is thus insufficient, as it cannot give rise to the observed behaviour. Optically thin dust best accounts for the variability, where collisions drive dust production and destruction. Notably, the highest infrared variations are seen in systems that show Ca II emission, supporting planetesimal collisions for all known debris discs, with the most energetic occurring in those with detected gaseous debris. The sample includes the only polluted white dwarf with a circumbinary disc, where the signal of the day-night cycle of its irradiated substellar companion appears diluted by dust emission.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.5233S
Physical characterization of 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB>, the first known asteroid orbiting inside Venus orbit;;The first known asteroid with the orbit inside that of Venus is 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB>. This may be the largest member of a new population of small bodies with the aphelion smaller than 0.718 au, called Vatiras. The surface of 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB> is being constantly modified by the high temperature, by the strong solar wind irradiation that characterizes the innermost region of the Solar system, and by high-energy micrometeorite impacts. The study of its physical properties represents an extreme test-case for the science of near-Earth asteroids. Here, we report spectroscopic observations of 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB> in the 0.5-1.5-μm wavelength interval. These were performed with the Nordic Optical Telescope and the William Herschel Telescope. Based on the obtained spectra, we classify 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB> as a Sa-type asteroid. We estimate the diameter of this Vatira to be $1.50_{-0.65}^{+1.10}$ km by considering the average albedo of A-type and S-complex asteroids ( $p_V=0.23_{-0.08}^{+0.11}$ ), and the absolute magnitude (H = 16.40 ± 0.78 mag). The wide spectral band around 1 μm shows the signature of an olivine-rich composition. The estimated band centre BIC = 1.08 ± 0.02 μm corresponds to a ferroan olivine mineralogy similar to that of brachinite meteorites.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.3572P
The lifetimes of planetary debris discs around white dwarfs;;The lifetime of a planetary disc that orbits a white dwarf represents a crucial input parameter into evolutionary models of that system. Here we apply a purely analytical formalism to estimate lifetimes of the debris phase of these discs, before they are ground down into dust or are subject to sublimation from the white dwarf. We compute maximum lifetimes for three different types of white dwarf discs, formed from (I) radiative YORP break-up of exo-asteroids along the giant branch phases at 2-100 au, (II) radiation-less spin-up disruption of these minor planets at ${\sim} 1.5\!-\!4.5\, \mathrm{R}_{\odot }$ , and (III) tidal disruption of minor or major planets within about $1.3\, \mathrm{R}_{\odot }$ . We display these maximum lifetimes as a function of disc mass and extent, constituent planetesimal properties, and representative orbital excitations of eccentricity and inclination. We find that YORP discs with masses of up to 10<SUP>24</SUP> kg live long enough to provide a reservoir of surviving cm-sized pebbles and m- to km-sized boulders that can be perturbed intact to white dwarfs with cooling ages of up to 10 Gyr. Debris discs formed from the spin or tidal disruption of these minor planets or major planets can survive in a steady state for up to, respectively, 1 or 0.01 Myr, although most tidal discs would leave a steady state within about 1 yr. Our results illustrate that dust-less planetesimal transit detections are plausible, and would provide particularly robust evolutionary constraints. Our formalism can easily be adapted to individual systems and future discoveries.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.2292V
The possible disappearance of a massive star in the low-metallicity galaxy PHL 293B;;We investigate a suspected very massive star in one of the most metal-poor dwarf galaxies, PHL 293B. Excitingly, we find the sudden disappearance of the stellar signatures from our 2019 spectra, in particular the broad H lines with P Cygni profiles that have been associated with a massive luminous blue variable (LBV) star. Such features are absent from our spectra obtained in 2019 with the Echelle Spectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet- and Stable Spectroscopic Observation and X-shooter instruments of the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope. We compute radiative transfer models using CMFGEN, which fit the observed spectrum of the LBV and are consistent with ground-based and archival Hubble Space Telescope photometry. Our models show that during 2001-2011, the LBV had a luminosity L<SUB>*</SUB> = 2.5-3.5 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> L<SUB>⊙</SUB>, a mass-loss rate $\dot{M} = 0.005{-}0.020 ~{\rm M}_{\odot }$ yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, a wind velocity of 1000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, and effective and stellar temperatures of T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 6000-6800 and T<SUB>*</SUB> = 9500-15 000 K. These stellar properties indicate an eruptive state. We consider two main hypotheses for the absence of the broad emission components from the spectra obtained since 2011. One possibility is that we are seeing the end of an LBV eruption of a surviving star, with a mild drop in luminosity, a shift to hotter effective temperatures, and some dust obscuration. Alternatively, the LBV could have collapsed to a massive black hole without the production of a bright supernova.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.1902A
The VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea infrared variability catalogue (VIVA-I);;High extinction and crowding create a natural limitation for optical surveys towards the central regions of the Milky Way, where the gas and dust are mainly confined. Large-scale near-infrared (IR) surveys of the Galactic plane and bulge are a good opportunity to explore open scientific questions as well as to test our capability to explore future data sets efficiently. Thanks to the VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea (VVV) ESO public survey, it is now possible to explore a large number of objects in those regions. This paper addresses the variability analysis of all VVV point sources having more than 10 observations in VVVDR4 using a novel approach. In total, the near-IR light curves of 288 378 769 sources were analysed using methods developed in the New Insight Into Time Series Analysis project. As a result, we present a complete sample having 44 998 752 variable star candidates (VVV-CVSC), which include accurate individual coordinates, near-IR magnitudes (Z,Y,J, and H<SUB>s</SUB>), extinctions A(K<SUB>s</SUB>), variability indices, periods, amplitudes, among other parameters to assess the science. Unfortunately, a side effect of having a highly complete sample, is also having a high level of contamination by non-variable (contamination ratio of non-variables to variables is slightly over 10:1). To deal with this, we also provide some flags and parameters that can be used by the community to decrease the number of variable candidates without heavily decreasing the completeness of the sample. In particular, we cross-identified 339 601 of our sources with Simbad and AAVSO data bases, which provide us with information for these objects at other wavelengths. This subsample constitutes a unique resource to study the corresponding near-IR variability of known sources as well as to assess the IR variability related with X-ray and gamma-ray sources. On the other hand, the other ${\sim }99.5{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ sources in our sample constitutes a number of potentially new objects with variability information for the heavily crowded and reddened regions of the Galactic plane and bulge. The present results also provide an important queryable resource to perform variability analysis and to characterize ongoing and future surveys like TESS and LSST.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.1730F
Progenitors of early-time interacting supernovae;;We compute an extensive set of early-time spectra of supernovae interacting with circumstellar material using the radiative transfer code CMFGEN. Our models are applicable to events observed from 1 to a few days after explosion. Using these models, we constrain the progenitor and explosion properties of a sample of 17 observed interacting supernovae at early times. Because massive stars have strong mass-loss, these spectra provide valuable information about supernova progenitors, such as mass-loss rates, wind velocities, and surface abundances. We show that these events span a wide range of explosion and progenitor properties, exhibiting supernova luminosities in the 10<SUP>8</SUP> to 10<SUP>12</SUP> L<SUB>⊙</SUB> range, temperatures from 10 000 to 60 000 K, progenitor mass-loss rates from a few 10<SUP>-4</SUP> up to 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, wind velocities from 100 to 800 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, and surface abundances from solar-like to H-depleted. Our results suggest that many progenitors of supernovae interacting with circumstellar material have significantly increased mass-loss before explosion compared to what massive stars show during the rest of their lifetimes. We also infer a lack of correlation between surface abundances and mass-loss rates. This may point to the pre-explosion mass-loss mechanism being independent of stellar mass. We find that the majority of these events have CNO-processed surface abundances. In the single star scenario this points to a preference towards high-mass RSGs as progenitors of interacting SNe, while binary evolution could impact this conclusion. Our models are publicly available and readily applicable to analyse results from ongoing and future large-scale surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Factory.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.1325B
Spectroscopic and photometric periods of six ultracompact accreting binaries;;Ultracompact accreting binary systems each consist of a stellar remnant accreting helium-enriched material from a compact donor star. Such binaries include two related sub-classes, AM CVn-type binaries and helium cataclysmic variables, in both of which the central star is a white dwarf. We present a spectroscopic and photometric study of six accreting binaries with orbital periods in the range of 40-70 min, including phase-resolved VLT spectroscopy and high-speed ULTRACAM photometry. Four of these are AM CVn systems and two are helium cataclysmic variables. For four of these binaries we are able to identify orbital periods (of which three are spectroscopic). SDSS J1505+0659 has an orbital period of 67.8 min, significantly longer than previously believed, and longer than any other known AM CVn binary. We identify a Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) infrared excess in SDSS J1505+0659 that we believe to be the first direct detection of an AM CVn donor star in a non-direct impacting binary. The mass ratio of SDSS J1505+0659 is consistent with a white dwarf donor. CRTS J1028-0819 has an orbital period of 52.1 min, the shortest period of any helium cataclysmic variable. MOA 2010-BLG-087 is co-aligned with a K-class star that dominates its spectrum. ASASSN-14ei and ASASSN-14mv both show a remarkable number of echo outbursts following superoutbursts (13 and 10 echo outbursts respectively). ASASSN-14ei shows an increased outburst rate over the years following its superoutburst, perhaps resulting from an increased accretion rate.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.1243G
Observations of the low-luminosity Type Iax supernova 2019gsc: a fainter clone of SN 2008ha?;;We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the faint-and-fast evolving Type Iax supernova (SN) 2019gsc, extending from the time of g-band maximum until about 50 d post-maximum, when the object faded to an apparent r-band magnitude m<SUB>r</SUB> = 22.48 ± 0.11 mag. SN 2019gsc reached a peak luminosity of only M<SUB>g</SUB> = -13.58 ± 0.15 mag, and is characterized with a post-maximum decline rate Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(g) = 1.08 ± 0.14 mag. These light curve parameters are comparable to those measured for SN 2008ha of M<SUB>g</SUB> = -13.89 ± 0.14 mag at peak and Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(g) =1.80 ± 0.03 mag. The spectral features of SN 2019gsc also resemble those of SN 2008ha at similar phases. This includes both the extremely low ejecta velocity at maximum, ∼3000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, and at late-time (phase +54 d) strong forbidden iron and cobalt lines as well as both forbidden and permitted calcium features. Furthermore, akin to SN 2008ha, the bolometric light curve of SN 2019gsc is consistent with the production of ≈0.003 ± 0.001 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni. The explosion parameters, M<SUB>ej</SUB> ≈ 0.13 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and E<SUB>k</SUB> ≈ 12 × 10<SUP>48</SUP> erg, are also similar to those inferred for SN 2008ha. We estimate a subsolar oxygen abundance for the host galaxy of SN 2019gsc (12 + log<SUB>10</SUB>(O/H) =8.10 ± 0.18 dex), consistent with the equally metal-poor environment of SN 2008ha. Altogether, our data set for SN 2019gsc indicates that this is a member of a small but growing group of extreme SN Iax that includes SN 2008ha and SN 2010ae.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.1132T
Confirmation of monoperiodicity above 20 s for two blue large-amplitude pulsators;;Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) are a new class of pulsating variable stars. They are located close to the hot subdwarf branch in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and have spectral classes of late O or early B. Stellar evolution models indicate that these stars are likely radially pulsating, driven by iron group opacity in their interiors. A number of variable stars with a similar driving mechanism exist near the hot subdwarf branch with multiperiodic oscillations caused by either pressure (p) or gravity (g) modes. No multiperiodic signals were detected in the OGLE (Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment) discovery light curves since it would be difficult to detect short-period signals associated with higher order p modes with the OGLE cadence. Using the RISE instrument on the Liverpool Telescope, we produced high-cadence light curves of two BLAPs, OGLE-BLAP-009 (m<SUB>V</SUB> = 15.65 mag) and OGLE-BLAP-014 (m<SUB>V</SUB> = 16.79 mag), using a 720 nm longpass filter. Frequency analysis of these light curves identifies a primary oscillation with a period of 31.935 ± 0.0098 min and an amplitude from a Fourier series fit of 0.236 mag for BLAP-009. The analysis of BLAP-014 identifies a period of 33.625 ± 0.0214 min and an amplitude of 0.225 mag. Analysis of the residual light curves reveals no additional short-period variability down to an amplitude of 15.20 ± 0.26 mmag for BLAP-009 and 58.60 ± 3.44 mmag for BLAP-014 for minimum periods of 20 and 60 s, respectively. These results further confirm that the BLAPs are monoperiodic.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496.1105M
Classifying Single Stars and Spectroscopic Binaries Using Optical Stellar Templates;;Stellar spectral classification is a fundamental tool of modern astronomy, providing insight into physical characteristics such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity. Accurate and fast spectral typing is an integral need for large all-sky spectroscopic surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope. Here, we present the next version of PyHammer, a stellar spectral classification software that uses optical spectral templates and spectral line index measurements. PyHammer v2.0 extends the classification power to include dwarf carbon stars, DA white dwarf stars, and also double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2). This release also includes a new empirical library of luminosity-normalized spectra that can be used to flux calibrate observed spectra or to create synthetic SB2 spectra. We have generated physically reasonable SB2 combinations as templates, adding the ability to spectrally type SB2s to PyHammer. We test classification success rates on SB2 spectra, generated from the SDSS, across a wide range of spectral types and signal-to-noise ratios. Within the defined range of pairings described, more than 95% of SB2s are correctly classified.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJS..249...34R
Gaia 18dvy: A New FUor in the Cygnus OB3 Association;;We present optical-infrared photometric and spectroscopic observations of Gaia 18dvy, located in the Cygnus OB3 association at a distance of 1.88 kpc. Gaia 18dvy was noted by the Gaia alerts system when its light curve exhibited a ≳4 mag rise in 2018-2019. The brightening was also observable at mid-infared wavelengths. The infrared colors of Gaia 18dvy became bluer as the outburst progressed. Its optical and near-infrared spectroscopic characteristics in the outburst phase are consistent with those of bona fide FU Orionis-type young eruptive stars. The progenitor of the outburst is probably a low-mass K-type star with an optical extinction of ∼3 mag. A radiative transfer modeling of the circumstellar structure, based on the quiescent spectral energy distribution, indicates a disk with a mass of 4 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Our simple accretion disk modeling implies that the accretion rate had been exponentially increasing for more than 3 yr until mid-2019, when it reached a peak value of 6.9 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. In many respects, Gaia 18dvy is similar to the FU Ori-type object HBC 722.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...899..130S
X-Ray Properties of Young Radio Quasars at z > 4.5;;We present a comprehensive analysis of Chandra X-ray observations of 15 young radio quasars at redshifts 4.5 < z < 5.0. All sources are detected in the 0.5-7.0 keV energy band. Emission spectra are extracted, and the average photon index for the sample is measured to be 1.5 ± 0.1. Unabsorbed rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosities are found to range between (0.5-23.2) × 10<SUP>45</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The optical-X-ray power-law spectral index ${\alpha }_{\mathrm{ox}}$ is calculated for each source using optical/UV data available in the literature. The ${\alpha }_{\mathrm{ox}}$ -UV relationship is compared with other quasar surveys, and an anticorrelation is observed that agrees with independent estimates. Rest-frame radio and X-ray luminosities are established for the sample, and a correlation between the luminosities is detected. These multiwavelength results reinforce a lack of spectral evolution for quasars over a broad redshift range. We additionally identify three quasars from our multiwavelength analysis that are statistically significant outliers, with one source being a Compton-thick candidate in the early universe, and discuss each in detail.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...899..127S
Gigayear-timescale Destruction of High-eccentricity Asteroids by Spin and Why 2006 HY51 Has Been Spared;;Asteroids and other small celestial bodies have markedly prolate shapes, and the perturbative triaxial torques that are applied during pericenter passages in highly eccentric orbits trigger and sustain a state of chaotic rotation. Because the prograde spin rate around the principal axis of inertia is not bounded from above, it can accidentally reach the threshold value corresponding to rotational breakup. Previous investigations of this process were limited to integrations of ∼10<SUP>3</SUP> orbits because of the stiff equation of motion. We present here a fast 1D simulation method to compute the evolution of this spin rate over ∼10<SUP>9</SUP> orbits. We apply the method to the most eccentric solar system asteroid known, 2006 HY51 (with e = 0.9684), and find that for any reasonably expected shape parameters it can never be accelerated to breakup speed. However, primordial solar system asteroids on more eccentric orbits may have already broken up from this type of rotational fission. The method also represents a promising opportunity to investigate the long-term evolution of extremely eccentric triaxial exo-asteroids (e > 0.99), which are thought to be common in white dwarf planetary systems.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...899..103M
A Systematic Study on the Rise Time-Peak Luminosity Relation for Bright Optical Transients Powered by Wind Shock Breakout;;A number of astrophysical transients originating from stellar explosions are powered by the collision of the ejected material with the circumstellar medium, which efficiently produces thermal radiation via shock dissipation. We investigate how such interaction-powered transients are distributed in the peak bolometric luminosity versus the rise time phase space. Taking advantage of less time-consuming one-dimensional simulations with spherical symmetry, we calculated more than 500 models with different circumstellar mass and radius, ejecta mass and energy, and chemical compositions. The peak bolometric luminosity, the total radiated energy, and the rise time of the interaction-powered emission are measured for each simulated light curve. We consider how these characteristic quantities are determined as a function of the model parameters and discuss possible implications for the observed populations of (potential) interaction-powered transients, such as Type IIn supernovae and fast blue optical transients.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...899...56S
Early Ultraviolet Observations of Type IIn Supernovae Constrain the Asphericity of Their Circumstellar Material;;We present a survey of the early evolution of 12 Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) at ultraviolet and visible light wavelengths. We use this survey to constrain the geometry of the circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding SN IIn explosions, which may shed light on their progenitor diversity. In order to distinguish between aspherical and spherical CSM, we estimate the blackbody radius temporal evolution of the SNe IIn of our sample, following the method introduced by Soumagnac et al. We find that higher-luminosity objects tend to show evidence for aspherical CSM. Depending on whether this correlation is due to physical reasons or to some selection bias, we derive a lower limit between 35% and 66% for the fraction of SNe IIn showing evidence for aspherical CSM. This result suggests that asphericity of the CSM surrounding SNe IIn is common—consistent with data from resolved images of stars undergoing considerable mass loss. It should be taken into account for more realistic modeling of these events.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...899...51S
TOI-1728b: The Habitable-zone Planet Finder Confirms a Warm Super-Neptune Orbiting an M-dwarf Host;;We confirm the planetary nature of TOI-1728b using a combination of ground-based photometry, near-infrared Doppler velocimetry and spectroscopy with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder. TOI-1728 is an old, inactive M0 star with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = ${3980}_{-32}^{+31}$ K, which hosts a transiting super-Neptune at an orbital period of ∼3.49 days. Joint fitting of the radial velocities and TESS and ground-based transits yields a planetary radius of ${5.05}_{-0.17}^{+0.16}$ R<SUB>⊕</SUB>, mass ${26.78}_{-5.13}^{+5.43}$ M<SUB>⊕</SUB>, and eccentricity ${0.057}_{-0.039}^{+0.054}$ . We estimate the stellar properties, and perform a search for He 10830 Šabsorption during the transit of this planet and claim a null detection with an upper limit of 1.1% with 90% confidence. A deeper level of He 10830 Šabsorption has been detected in the planet atmosphere of GJ 3470b, a comparable gaseous planet. TOI-1728b is the largest super-Neptune—the intermediate subclass of planets between Neptune and the more massive gas-giant planets—discovered around an M dwarf. With its relatively large mass and radius, TOI-1728 represents a valuable data point in the M-dwarf exoplanet mass-radius diagram, bridging the gap between the lighter Neptune-sized planets and the heavier Jovian planets known to orbit M dwarfs. With a low bulk density of ${1.14}_{-0.24}^{+0.26}$ g cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, and orbiting a bright host star (J ∼ 9.6, V ∼ 12.4), TOI-1728b is also a promising candidate for transmission spectroscopy both from the ground and from space, which can be used to constrain planet formation and evolutionary models.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...899...29K
Detections of Simultaneous Brightening of γ-Ray and Optical Emissions of a Distant Blazar GB 1508+5714 at Redshift 4.3;;GB 1508+5714 is a high-redshift blazar (z = 4.3), and a spectrally soft γ-ray source has been detected in its direction. By analyzing 11.4 yr Fermi Large Area Telescope data, significant long-term variability of the γ-ray source is confirmed. More importantly, a γ-ray emission flare appeared in an epoch of several tens of days in 2018, when the flux was about four times the value from the global fit. Meanwhile, optical flares were displayed in both the r and i bands from the Zwicky Transient Facility light curves. Detections of the simultaneous γ-ray and optical brightening provide decisive evidence to pin down the association between the γ-ray source and GB 1508+5714, which makes it the first identified γ-ray blazar beyond redshift 4. A broadband spectral energy distribution in the high flux state is constructed, and the origin of the multiwavelength brightening is also briefly discussed. Upcoming wide-deep-fast optical telescopes together with the γ-ray sky surveyors will shed light on the role that the active galactic nucleus jets play in the early cosmic time.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...898L..56L
Of Harbingers and Higher Modes: Improved Gravitational-wave Early Warning of Compact Binary Mergers;;A crucial component to maximizing the science gain from the multi-messenger follow-up of gravitational-wave (GW) signals from compact binary mergers is the prompt discovery of the electromagnetic counterpart. Ideally, the GW detection and localization must be reported early enough to allow for telescopes to slew to the location of the GW event before the onset of the counterpart. However, the time available for early warning is limited by the short duration spent by the dominant (ℓ = m = 2) mode within the detector's frequency band. Nevertheless, we show that including higher modes—which enter the detector's sensitivity band well before the dominant mode—in GW searches can enable us to significantly improve the early warning ability for compact binaries with asymmetric masses (such as neutron star-black hole (NSBH) binaries). We investigate the reduction in the localization sky-area when the ℓ = m = 3 and ℓ = m = 4 modes are included in addition to the dominant mode, considering typical slew-times of electromagnetic telescopes (30-60 s). We find that, in LIGO's projected "O5" ("Voyager") network with five GW detectors, some of the NSBH mergers, located at a distance of 40 Mpc, can be localized to a few hundred sq. deg. ∼45 s prior to the merger, corresponding to a reduction-factor of 3-4 (5-6) in sky-area. For a third-generation network, we get gains of up to 1.5 min in early warning times for a localization area of 100 sq. deg., even when the source is placed at 100 Mpc.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...898L..39K
SN 2019ehk: A Double-peaked Ca-rich Transient with Luminous X-Ray Emission and Shock-ionized Spectral Features;;We present panchromatic observations and modeling of the Calcium-rich supernova (SN) 2019ehk in the star-forming galaxy M100 (d ≈ 16.2 Mpc) starting 10 hr after explosion and continuing for ∼300 days. SN 2019ehk shows a double-peaked optical light curve peaking at t = 3 and 15 days. The first peak is coincident with luminous, rapidly decaying Swift-XRT-discovered X-ray emission ( ${L}_{{\rm{x}}}\approx {10}^{41}\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ at 3 days; L<SUB>x</SUB> ∝ t<SUP>-3</SUP>), and a Shane/Kast spectral detection of narrow Hα and He II emission lines (v ≈ 500 $\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ ) originating from pre-existent circumstellar material (CSM). We attribute this phenomenology to radiation from shock interaction with extended, dense material surrounding the progenitor star at r < 10<SUP>15</SUP> cm and the resulting cooling emission. We calculate a total CSM mass of ∼7 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> ${M}_{\odot }$ (M<SUB>He</SUB>/M<SUB>H</SUB> ≈6) with particle density n ≈ 10<SUP>9</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. Radio observations indicate a significantly lower density n < 10<SUP>4</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> at larger radii r > (0.1-1) × 10<SUP>17</SUP> cm. The photometric and spectroscopic properties during the second light-curve peak are consistent with those of Ca-rich transients (rise-time of t<SUB>r</SUB> = 13.4 ± 0.210 days and a peak B-band magnitude of M<SUB>B</SUB> = -15.1 ± 0.200 mag). We find that SN 2019ehk synthesized (3.1 ± 0.11) × 10<SUP>-2</SUP> ${M}_{\odot }$ of ${}^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and ejected M<SUB>ej</SUB> = (0.72 ± 0.040) ${M}_{\odot }$ total with a kinetic energy E<SUB>k</SUB> = (1.8 ± 0.10) × 10<SUP>50</SUP> erg. Finally, deep HST pre-explosion imaging at the SN site constrains the parameter space of viable stellar progenitors to massive stars in the lowest mass bin (∼10 ${M}_{\odot }$ ) in binaries that lost most of their He envelope or white dwarfs (WDs). The explosion and environment properties of SN 2019ehk further restrict the potential WD progenitor systems to low-mass hybrid HeCO WD+CO WD binaries.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...898..166J
Ground deformation and fissure activity of the Yuncheng Basin (China) revealed by multiband time series InSAR;;The Yuncheng Basin (China) is affected by severe land subsidence and ground fissure hazards, which have caused serious land damage and economic losses to the local inhabitants. Due to the lack of long-term continuous monitoring in the region, the trend of land subsidence and fissure activities is unknown, which cannot meet requirements for disaster reduction and disaster prevention. In this study, Envisat ASAR, ALOS PALSAR, and TerraSAR-X are employed to monitor these hazards using time series InSAR methodology. The results showed that there were two obvious subsidence centers occurred in Yuncheng. Compared to the period from 2007 to 2011, the land subsidence rate in the Yuncheng Basin from 2012 to 2015 decreased significantly. Analysis of the differential deformation rate observed by InSAR between the two sides of the ground fissure indicates that fissure activity has weakened in recent years at the cross-section. To explain the phenomena observed by InSAR, FLAC3D was used to study the effect of pumping on ground fissure activity under the condition of pre-existing faults, and the results show that pumping promotes differential activities between two sides of the fault and has a positive impact on the occurrence and the activity of ground fissures. Horizontal rectangular sill with uniform opening model is used to simulate the land subsidence and invert the pumping depth. The results are basically consistent with the local situation.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AdSpR..66..490Y
Physical Characterization of Interstellar Comet 2I/2019 Q4 (Borisov);;We present a study of interstellar comet 2I/2019 Q4 (Borisov) using both preperihelion and postperihelion observations spanning late September 2019 through late January 2020. The intrinsic brightness of the comet was observed to continuously decline throughout the timespan, likely due to the decreasing effective scattering cross-section as a result of volatile sublimation with a slope of -0.43 ± 0.02 km<SUP>2</SUP> d<SUP>-1</SUP>. We witnessed no significant change in the slightly reddish color of the comet, with mean values of $\left\langle g-r\right\rangle =0.68\pm 0.04$ , $\left\langle r-i\right\rangle =0.23\pm 0.03$ , and the normalized reflectivity gradient across the g and i bands $\overline{S^{\prime} }\left(g,i\right)=\left(10.6\pm 1.4\right)$ % per 10<SUP>3</SUP> Å, all unremarkable in the context of solar system comets. Using the available astrometric observations, we confidently detect the nongravitational acceleration of the comet following a shallow heliocentric distance dependence of ${r}_{{\rm{H}}}^{-1\pm 1}$ . Accordingly, we estimate that the nucleus is most likely $\lesssim 0.4$ km in radius, and that a fraction of ≳0.2% of the total mass of the nucleus has been eroded due to the sublimation activity since the earliest observation of the comet in 2018 December by the time of perihelion. Our morphology simulation suggests that the dust ejection speed increased from ∼4 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> in 2019 September to ∼7 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> around perihelion for the optically dominant dust grains with $\beta \sim 0.01$ , and that the observable dust grains are no smaller than micron size.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160...92H
Galaxy optical variability of Virgo cluster: new tracer for environmental influences on galaxies;;We investigate the relationship between the optical variability of galaxies and their distances from the centre of the Virgo cluster using Palomar Transient Factory data. We define the ratio between the standard deviation of the galaxy brightness and the mean value of the standard deviation as a measure of a galaxy's optical variability. A sample of 814 Virgo galaxies with 230 263 observations shows a monotonically decreasing trend of optical variability with increasing clustercentric distance. The variability level inside the cluster is 3.2σ higher than the level outside. We fit the variability with a linear function and find that the data reject a distance-independent model. We examine 217 background galaxies for comparison and find no significant trend in galaxy variability. We assess the relation with Monte Carlo simulation by rebuilding the brightness of each galaxy. The simulation shows a monotonically decreasing relation for member galaxy variability and a distance-independent relation for background galaxies. Our result is consistent with the theory that the cold gas flowing inwards the cluster centre fuels AGN activity. This work is a new implementation of the method using optical variability to investigate the relation between galaxies evolution and their environment.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.496L..59Y
Observing the earliest moments of supernovae using strong gravitational lenses;;We determine the viability of exploiting lensing time delays to observe strongly gravitationally lensed supernovae (gLSNe) from first light. Assuming a plausible discovery strategy, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) will discover ∼110 and ∼1 systems per year before the supernova (SN) explosion in the final image, respectively. Systems will be identified $11.7^{+29.8}_{-9.3}$ d before the final explosion. We then explore the possibility of performing early-time observations for Type IIP and Type Ia SNe in LSST-discovered systems. Using a simulated Type IIP explosion, we predict that the shock breakout in one trailing image per year will peak at ≲24.1 mag (≲23.3) in the B-band (F218W), however evolving over a time-scale of ∼30 min. Using an analytic model of Type Ia companion interaction, we find that in the B-band we should observe at least one shock cooling emission event per year that peaks at ≲26.3 mag (≲29.6) assuming all Type Ia gLSNe have a 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> red giant (main sequence) companion. We perform Bayesian analysis to investigate how well deep observations with 1 h exposures on the European Extremely Large Telescope would discriminate between Type Ia progenitor populations. We find that if all Type Ia SNe evolved from the double-degenerate channel, then observations of the lack of early blue flux in 10 (50) trailing images would rule out more than 27 per cent (19 per cent) of the population having 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> main sequence companions at 95 per cent confidence.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.495.4622F
Examining supernova events in Type 1 active galactic nuclei;;A statistical study of intermediate Palomar Transient Factory supernovae (SNe) in Type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has shown a major deficit of supernovae around Type 1 AGN host galaxies, with respect to Type 2 AGN hosts. The aim of this work is to test whether there is any preference for Type 1 AGNs to host SN of a specific kind. Through the analysis of SN occurrence and their type (thermonuclear versus core-collapse), we can directly link the type of stars producing the SN events, thus this is an indirect way to study host galaxies in Type 1 AGNs. We examine the detection fractions of SNe, the host galaxies and compare the sample properties to typical host galaxies in the Open Supernova Catalog (OSC). The majority of the host galaxies in the AGN sample are late type, similar to typical galaxies hosting SN within the OSC. The findings are supportive of a deficiency of SNe near Type 1 AGNs, although we cannot with certainty assess the overall detection fractions of SNe in Type 1 AGNs relative to other SN host galaxies. We can state that Type 1 AGN has equal detection fractions of thermonuclear versus core-collapse SNe. However, we note the possibility of a higher detection rate of core-collapse supernovae in Type 1 AGN with insecure AGN classifications.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.495.4419V
Dynamic scheduling: target of opportunity observations of gravitational wave events;;The simultaneous detection of electromagnetic and gravitational waves from the coalescence of two neutron stars (GW170817 and GRB170817A) has ushered in a new era of 'multimessenger' astronomy, with electromagnetic detections spanning from gamma to radio. This great opportunity for new scientific investigations raises the issue of how the available multimessenger tools can best be integrated to constitute a powerful method to study the transient Universe in particular. To facilitate the classification of possible optical counterparts to gravitational wave events, it is important to optimize the scheduling of observations and the filtering of transients, both key elements of the follow-up process. In this work, we describe the existing workflow whereby telescope networks such as GRANDMA and GROWTH are currently scheduled; we then present modifications we have developed for the scheduling process specifically, so as to face the relevant challenges that have appeared during the latest observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. We address issues with scheduling more than one epoch for multiple fields within a skymap, especially for large and disjointed localizations. This is done in two ways: by optimizing the maximum number of fields that can be scheduled and by splitting up the lobes within the skymap by right ascension to be scheduled individually. In addition, we implement the ability to take previously observed fields into consideration when rescheduling. We show the improvements that these modifications produce in making the search for optical counterparts more efficient, and we point to areas needing further improvement.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.495.4366A
Spikey: self-lensing flares from eccentric SMBH binaries;;We examine the light curves of two quasars, motivated by recent suggestions that a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) can exhibit sharp lensing spikes. We model the variability of each light curve as due to a combination of two relativistic effects: the orbital relativistic Doppler boost and gravitational binary self-lensing. In order to model each system, we extend previous Doppler plus self-lensing models to include eccentricity. The first quasar is identified in optical data as a binary candidate with a 20-yr period (Ark 120), and shows a prominent spike. For this source, we rule out the lensing hypothesis and disfavour the Doppler-boost hypothesis due to discrepancies in the measured versus recovered values of the binary mass and optical spectral slope. The second source, which we nickname Spikey, is the rare case of an active galactic nucleus identified in Kepler's high-quality, high-cadence photometric data. For this source, we find a model, consisting of a combination of Doppler modulation and a narrow symmetric lensing spike, consistent with an eccentric SMBHB with a mass of M<SUB>tot</SUB> = 3 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, rest-frame orbital period T = 418 d, eccentricity e = 0.5, and seen at an inclination of 8<SUP>○</SUP> from edge-on. This interpretation can be tested by monitoring Spikey for periodic behaviour and recurring flares in the next few years. In preparation for such monitoring, we present the first X-ray observations of this object taken by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.495.4061H
Supernova host galaxies in the dark energy survey: I. Deep coadds, photometry, and stellar masses;;The 5-yr Dark Energy Survey Supernova Programme (DES-SN) is one of the largest and deepest transient surveys to date in terms of volume and number of supernovae. Identifying and characterizing the host galaxies of transients plays a key role in their classification, the study of their formation mechanisms, and the cosmological analyses. To derive accurate host galaxy properties, we create depth-optimized coadds using single-epoch DES-SN images that are selected based on sky and atmospheric conditions. For each of the five DES-SN seasons, a separate coadd is made from the other four seasons such that each SN has a corresponding deep coadd with no contaminating SN emission. The coadds reach limiting magnitudes of order ∼27 in g band, and have a much smaller magnitude uncertainty than the previous DES-SN host templates, particularly for faint objects. We present the resulting multiband photometry of host galaxies for samples of spectroscopically confirmed type Ia (SNe Ia), core-collapse (CCSNe), and superluminous (SLSNe) as well as rapidly evolving transients (RETs) discovered by DES-SN. We derive host galaxy stellar masses and probabilistically compare stellar-mass distributions to samples from other surveys. We find that the DES spectroscopically confirmed sample of SNe Ia selects preferentially fewer high-mass hosts at high-redshift compared to other surveys, while at low redshift the distributions are consistent. DES CCSNe and SLSNe hosts are similar to other samples, while RET hosts are unlike the hosts of any other transients, although these differences have not been disentangled from selection effects.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.495.4040W
LAMOST J202629.80+423652.0 is not a symbiotic star;;LAMOST J202629.80+423652.0 has been recently classified as a new symbiotic star containing a long-period Mira, surrounded by dust (D-type) and displaying in the optical spectra high ionization emission lines, including the Raman-scattered OVI at 6825 Å. We have observed LAMOST J202629.80+423652.0 photometrically in the BVRI bands and spectroscopically over the 3500-8000 Å range. We have found it to be a normal G8 IV sub-giant star, deprived of any emission line in its spectrum, and reddened by E<SUB>B-V</SUB>=0.35 mag. Combining our photometry with data from all-sky patrol surveys, we find LAMOST J202629.80+423652.0 to be non variable, so not pulsating as a Mira. We have compiled from existing sources its spectral energy distribution, extending well into the mid-Infrared, and found it completely dominated by the G8 IV photospheric stellar emission, without any sign of circumstellar dust. We therefore conclude that LAMOST J202629.80+423652.0 is not a symbiotic star, nor it is pulsating or been enshrouded in dust.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020CoSka..50..672A
The Zwicky Transient Facility Catalog of Periodic Variable Stars;;The number of known periodic variables has grown rapidly in recent years. Thanks to its large field of view and faint limiting magnitude, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) offers a unique opportunity to detect variable stars in the northern sky. Here, we exploit ZTF Data Release 2 (DR2) to search for and classify variables down to r ∼ 20.6 mag. We classify 781,602 periodic variables into 11 main types using an improved classification method. Comparison with previously published catalogs shows that 621,702 objects (79.5%) are newly discovered or newly classified, including ∼700 Cepheids, ∼5000 RR Lyrae stars, ∼15,000 δ Scuti variables, ∼350,000 eclipsing binaries, ∼100,000 long-period variables, and about 150,000 rotational variables. The typical misclassification rate and period accuracy are on the order of 2% and 99%, respectively. 74% of our variables are located at Galactic latitudes, $| b|  10^\circ $ . This large sample of Cepheids, RR Lyrae, δ Scuti stars, and contact (EW-type) eclipsing binaries is helpful to investigate the Galaxy's disk structure and evolution with an improved completeness, areal coverage, and age resolution. Specifically, the northern warp and the disk's edge at distances of 15-20 kpc are significantly better covered than previously. Among rotational variables, RS Canum Venaticorum and BY Draconis-type variables can be separated easily. Our knowledge of stellar chromospheric activity would benefit greatly from a statistical analysis of these types of variables.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJS..249...18C
Microlensing Optical Depth and Event Rate in the OGLE-IV Galactic Plane Fields;;Searches for gravitational microlensing events are traditionally concentrated on the central regions of the Galactic bulge but many microlensing events are expected to occur in the Galactic plane, far from the Galactic Center. Owing to the difficulty in conducting high-cadence observations of the Galactic plane over its vast area, which are necessary for the detection of microlensing events, their global properties were hitherto unknown. Here, we present results of the first comprehensive search for microlensing events in the Galactic plane. We searched an area of almost 3000 square degrees along the Galactic plane ( $| b|  7^\circ $ , 0° < l < 50°, 190° < l < 360°) observed by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) during 2013-2019 and detected 630 events. We demonstrate that the mean Einstein timescales of Galactic plane microlensing events are on average three times longer than those of Galactic bulge events, with little dependence on the Galactic longitude. We also measure the microlensing optical depth and event rate as a function of Galactic longitude and demonstrate that they exponentially decrease with the angular distance from the Galactic Center (with the characteristic angular scale length of 32°). The average optical depth decreases from 0.5 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> at l = 10° to 1.5 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> in the Galactic anticenter. We also find that the optical depth in the longitude range 240° < l < 330° is asymmetric about the Galactic equator, which we interpret as a signature of the Galactic warp.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJS..249...16M
A New Class of Roche Lobe-filling Hot Subdwarf Binaries;;We present the discovery of the second binary with a Roche lobe-filling hot subdwarf transferring mass to a white dwarf (WD) companion. This 56 minute binary was discovered using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility. Spectroscopic observations reveal an He-sdOB star with an effective temperature of T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 33,700 ± 1000 K and a surface gravity of log(g) = 5.54 ± 0.11. The GTC+HiPERCAM light curve is dominated by the ellipsoidal deformation of the He-sdOB star and shows an eclipse of the He-sdOB by an accretion disk as well as a weak eclipse of the WD. We infer a He-sdOB mass of M<SUB>sdOB</SUB> = 0.41 ± 0.04 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a WD mass of M<SUB>WD</SUB> = 0.68 ± 0.05 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The weak eclipses imply a WD blackbody temperature of 63,000 ± 10,000 K and a radius R<SUB>WD</SUB> = 0.0148 ± 0.0020 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> as expected for a WD of such high temperature. The He-sdOB star is likely undergoing hydrogen shell burning and will continue transferring mass for ≈1 Myr at a rate of 10<SUP>-9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is consistent with the high WD temperature. The hot subdwarf will then turn into a WD and the system will merge in ≈30 Myr. We suggest that Galactic reddening could bias discoveries toward preferentially finding Roche lobe-filling systems during the short-lived shell-burning phase. Studies using reddening-corrected samples should reveal a large population of helium core-burning hot subdwarfs with T<SUB>eff</SUB> ≈ 25,000 K in binaries of 60-90 minutes with WDs. Though not yet in contact, these binaries would eventually come into contact through gravitational-wave emission and explode as a subluminous thermonuclear supernova or evolve into a massive single WD.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...898L..25K
The Spectacular Ultraviolet Flash from the Peculiar Type Ia Supernova 2019yvq;;Early observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provide essential clues for understanding the progenitor system that gave rise to the terminal thermonuclear explosion. We present exquisite observations of SN 2019yvq, the second observed SN Ia, after iPTF 14atg, to display an early flash of emission in the ultraviolet (UV) and optical. Our analysis finds that SN 2019yvq was unusual, even when ignoring the initial flash, in that it was moderately underluminous for an SN Ia ( ${M}_{g}\approx -18.5$ mag at peak) yet featured very high absorption velocities ( $v\approx 15{\rm{,0}}00$ km s<SUP>-1</SUP> for Si II λ6355 at peak). We find that many of the observational features of SN 2019yvq, aside from the flash, can be explained if the explosive yield of radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni is relatively low (we measure ${M}_{{56}_{\mathrm{Ni}}}=0.31\pm 0.05\,{M}_{\odot }$ ) and it and other iron-group elements are concentrated in the innermost layers of the ejecta. To explain both the UV/optical flash and peak properties of SN 2019yvq we consider four different models: interaction between the SN ejecta and a nondegenerate companion, extended clumps of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni in the outer ejecta, a double-detonation explosion, and the violent merger of two white dwarfs. Each of these models has shortcomings when compared to the observations; it is clear additional tuning is required to better match SN 2019yvq. In closing, we predict that the nebular spectra of SN 2019yvq will feature either H or He emission, if the ejecta collided with a companion, strong [Ca II] emission, if it was a double detonation, or narrow [O I] emission, if it was due to a violent merger.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...898...56M
Comparing Moment-based and Monte Carlo Methods of Radiation Transport Modeling for Type II-Plateau Supernova Light Curves;;Time-dependent electromagnetic signatures from core-collapse supernovae are the result of detailed transport of the shock-deposited and radioactively powered radiation through the stellar ejecta. Due to the complexity of the underlying radiative processes, considerable approximations are made to simplify key aspects of the radiation transport problem. We present a systematic comparison of the moment-based radiation hydrodynamical code STELLA and the Monte Carlo radiation transport code Sedona in the 1D modeling of Type II-Plateau supernovae. Based on explosion models generated from the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics instrument, we find remarkable agreements in the modeled light curves and the ejecta structure thermal evolution, affirming the fidelity of both radiation transport modeling approaches. The radiative moments computed directly by the Monte Carlo scheme in Sedona also verify the accuracy of the moment-based scheme. We find that the coarse resolutions of the opacity tables and the numerical approximations in STELLA have an insignificant impact on the resulting bolometric light curves, making it an efficient tool for the specific task of optical light-curve modeling.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...898...29T
Intermediate Luminosity Red Transients by Black Holes Born from Erupting Massive Stars;;We consider black hole formation in failed supernovae when a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) is present around the massive star progenitor. By utilizing radiation hydrodynamical simulations, we calculate the mass ejection of blue supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars in the collapsing phase and the radiative shock occurring between the ejecta and the ambient CSM. We find that the resultant emission is redder and dimmer than normal supernovae (bolometric luminosity of 10<SUP>40</SUP>- ${10}^{41}\ \mathrm{erg}\ {{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ , effective temperature of ∼5 × 10<SUP>3</SUP> K, and timescale of 10-100 days) and shows a characteristic power-law decay, which may comprise a fraction of intermediate luminosity red transients (ILRTs) including AT 2017be. In addition to searching for the progenitor star in the archival data, we encourage X-ray follow-up observations of such ILRTs ∼1-10 yr after the collapse, targeting the fallback accretion disk.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897L..44T
Image-based Classification of Variable Stars: First Results from Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment Data;;Recently, machine learning methods have presented a viable solution for the automated classification of image-based data in various research fields and business applications. Scientists require a fast and reliable solution in order to handle increasingly large amounts of astronomical data. However, so far astronomers have been mainly classifying variable starlight curves based on various pre-computed statistics and light curve parameters. In this work we use an image-based Convolutional Neural Network to classify the different types of variable stars. We use images of phase-folded light curves from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE)-III survey for training, validating, and testing, and use OGLE-IV survey as an independent data set for testing. After the training phase, our neural network was able to classify the different types between 80% and 99%, and 77%-98%, accuracy for OGLE-III and OGLE-IV, respectively.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897L..12S
A White Dwarf with Transiting Circumstellar Material Far outside the Roche Limit;;We report the discovery of a white dwarf exhibiting deep, irregularly shaped transits, indicative of circumstellar planetary debris. Using Zwicky Transient Facility DR2 photometry of ZTF J013906.17+524536.89 and follow-up observations from the Las Cumbres Observatory, we identify multiple transit events that recur every ≈107.2 days, much longer than the 4.5-4.9 hr orbital periods observed in WD 1145+017, the only other white dwarf known with transiting planetary debris. The transits vary in both depth and duration, lasting 15-25 days and reaching 20%-45% dips in flux. Optical spectra reveal strong Balmer lines, identifying the white dwarf as a DA with ${T}_{\mathrm{eff}}=10,530\pm 140\,{\rm{K}}$ and $\mathrm{log}(g)=7.86\pm 0.06$ . A Ca II K absorption feature is present in all spectra both in and out of transit. Spectra obtained during one night at roughly 15% transit depth show increased Ca II K absorption with a model atmospheric fit suggesting [Ca/H] = -4.6 ± 0.3, whereas spectra taken on three nights out of transit have [Ca/H] of -5.5, -5.3, and -4.9 with similar uncertainties. While the Ca II K line strength varies by only 2σ, we consider a predominantly interstellar origin for Ca absorption unlikely. We suggest a larger column density of circumstellar metallic gas along the line of site or increased accretion of material onto the white dwarf's surface are responsible for the Ca absorption, but further spectroscopic studies are required. In addition, high-speed time series photometry out of transit reveals variability with periods of 900 and 1030 s, consistent with ZZ Ceti pulsations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897..171V
Constraining the Source of the High-velocity Ejecta in Type Ia SN 2019ein;;We present multiwavelength photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2019ein, a high-velocity Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 5353 with a two-day nondetection limit. SN 2019ein exhibited some of the highest measured expansion velocities of any SN Ia, with a Si II absorption minimum blueshifted by 24,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> at 14 days before peak brightness. More unusually, we observed the emission components of the P Cygni profiles to be blueshifted upward of 10,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> before B-band maximum light. This blueshift, among the highest in a sample of 28 other SNe Ia, is greatest at our earliest spectroscopic epoch and subsequently decreases toward maximum light. We discuss possible progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms that could explain these extreme absorption and emission velocities. Radio observations beginning 14 days before B-band maximum light yield nondetections at the position of SN 2019ein, which rules out symbiotic progenitor systems, most models of fast optically thick accretion winds, and optically thin shells of mass $\lesssim {10}^{-6}$ ${M}_{\odot }$ at radii $ 100\,\mathrm{au}$ . Comparing our spectra to models and observations of other high-velocity SNe Ia, we find that SN 2019ein is well fit by a delayed-detonation explosion. We propose that the high emission velocities may be the result of abundance enhancements due to ejecta mixing in an asymmetric explosion, or optical depth effects in the photosphere of the ejecta at early times. These findings may provide evidence for common explosion mechanisms and ejecta geometries among high-velocity SNe Ia.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897..159P
A Wind-driven Model: Application to Peculiar Transients AT2018cow and iPTF14hls;;We propose a wind-driven model for peculiar transients, and apply the model to AT2018cow and iPTF14hls. In the wind-driven model, we assume that a continuous outflow like a stellar wind is injected from a central system. While these transients have different observational properties, this model can explain their photometric properties which are not reproduced by a supernova-like instantaneous explosion. Furthermore, the model predicts characteristic spectral features and evolution, which are well in line with those of AT2018cow and iPTF14hls. Despite the different observational properties, the wind model shows that they have some common features; the large mass-loss rates (up to $\sim 20{M}_{\odot }\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$ for AT2018cow and $\sim 75{M}_{\odot }\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$ for iPTF14hls), and the characteristic radii of $\sim {10}^{13}\,\mathrm{cm}$ for the launch of the wind. It would indicate that both may be related to events involving a red supergiant (RSG), in which the RSG envelope is rapidly ejected by an event at a stellar core scale. On the other hand, the main differences are the kinetic energies, the total ejected mass, and the timescales. We then suggest that iPTF14hls may represent a dynamical common-envelope evolution induced by a massive binary system ( $\sim 120{M}_{\odot }+100{M}_{\odot }$ ). AT2018cow may be either a tidal disruption event of a low-mass RSG by a black hole (BH), or a BH-forming failed supernova.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897..156U
Gravitational Microlensing Event Statistics for the Zwicky Transient Facility;;Microlensing surveys have discovered thousands of events, with almost all events discovered within the Galactic bulge or toward the Magellanic Clouds. The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), while not designed to be a microlensing campaign, is an optical time-domain survey that observes the entire northern sky, including the Galactic plane, every few nights. The ZTF observes ∼10<SUP>9</SUP> stars in the g and r bands and can significantly contribute to the observed microlensing population. We predict that the ZTF will observe ∼1100 microlensing events in 3 yr of observing within 10° latitude of the Galactic plane, with ∼500 events in the outer Galaxy (ℓ ≥ 10°). This yield increases to ∼1400 (∼800) events by combining every three ZTF exposures, ∼1800 (∼900) events if the ZTF observes for a total of 5 yr, and ∼2400 (∼1300) events for a 5 yr survey with postprocessing image stacking. Using the microlensing modeling software PopSyCLE, we compare the microlensing populations in the Galactic bulge and the outer Galaxy. We also present an analysis of the microlensing event ZTF18abhxjmj to demonstrate how to leverage these population statistics in event modeling. The ZTF will constrain Galactic structure, stellar populations, and primordial black holes through photometric microlensing.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897..144M
The Pre-explosion Mass Distribution of Hydrogen-poor Superluminous Supernova Progenitors and New Evidence for a Mass-Spin Correlation;;Despite indications that superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) originate from massive progenitors, the lack of a uniformly analyzed statistical sample has so far prevented a detailed view of the progenitor mass distribution. Here we present and analyze the pre-explosion mass distribution of hydrogen-poor SLSN progenitors as determined from uniformly modeled light curves of 62 events. We construct the distribution by summing the ejecta mass posteriors of each event, using magnetar light-curve models presented in our previous works (and using a nominal neutron star remnant mass). The resulting distribution spans 3.6-40 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with a sharp decline at lower masses, and is best fit by a broken power law described by ${dN}/d\mathrm{log}M\propto {M}^{-0.41\pm 0.06}$ at 3.6-8.6 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and $\propto {M}^{-1.26\pm 0.06}$ at 8.6-40 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We find that observational selection effects cannot account for the shape of the distribution. Relative to Type Ib/c SNe, the SLSN mass distribution extends to much larger masses and has a different power-law shape, likely indicating that the formation of a magnetar allows more massive stars to explode as some of the rotational energy accelerates the ejecta. Comparing the SLSN distribution with predictions from single and binary star evolution models, we find that binary models for a metallicity of Z ≲ 1/3 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB> are best able to reproduce its broad shape, in agreement with the preference of SLSNe for low metallicity environments. Finally, we uncover a correlation between the pre-explosion mass and the magnetar initial spin period, where SLSNe with low masses have slower spins, a trend broadly consistent with the effects of angular momentum transport evident in models of rapidly rotating carbon-oxygen stars.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897..114B
Continuum-fitting the X-Ray Spectra of Tidal Disruption Events;;We develop a new model for X-ray emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs), applying stationary general relativistic "slim disk" accretion solutions to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and then ray-tracing the photon trajectories from the image plane to the disk surface, including gravitational redshift, Doppler, and lensing effects self-consistently. We simultaneously and successfully fit the multi-epoch XMM-Newton X-ray spectra for two TDEs: ASASSN-14li and ASASSN-15oi. We test explanations for the observed, unexpectedly slow X-ray brightening of ASASSN-15oi, including delayed disk formation and variable obscuration by a reprocessing layer. We propose a new mechanism that better fits the data: a "slimming disk" scenario in which accretion onto an edge-on disk slows, reducing the disk height and exposing more X-rays from the inner disk to the sightline over time. For ASASSN-15oi, we constrain the SMBH mass to ${4.0}_{-3.1}^{+2.5}\times {10}^{6}{M}_{\odot }$ . For ASASSN-14li, the SMBH mass is ${10}_{-7}^{+1}\times {10}^{6}{M}_{\odot }$ , and the spin is >0.3. For both TDEs, our fitted masses are consistent with independent estimates; for ASASSN-14li, application of the external mass constraint narrows our spin constraint to >0.85. The mass accretion rate of ASASSN-14li decays slowly, as ∝t<SUP>-1.1</SUP>, perhaps due to inefficient debris circularization. Over ≈1100 days, its SMBH has accreted ΔM ≈ 0.17M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, implying a progenitor star mass of >0.34M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, I.e., no "missing energy problem." For both TDEs, the hydrogen column density declines to the host galaxy plus Milky Way value after a few hundred days, suggesting a characteristic timescale for the depletion or removal of obscuring gas.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897...80W
WALLABY - an SKA Pathfinder HI survey;;The Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) is a next-generation survey of neutral hydrogen (HI) in the Local Universe. It uses the widefield, high-resolution capability of the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), a radio interferometer consisting of 36 ×12 -m dishes equipped with Phased-Array Feeds (PAFs), located in an extremely radio-quiet zone in Western Australia. WALLABY aims to survey three-quarters of the sky (-90<SUP>∘</SUP><δ <+30<SUP>∘</SUP>) to a redshift of z ≲0.26 , and generate spectral line image cubes at ∼30 arcsec resolution and ∼1.6 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP> per 4 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> channel sensitivity. ASKAP's instantaneous field of view at 1.4 GHz, delivered by the PAF's 36 beams, is about 30 sq deg. At an integrated signal-to-noise ratio of five, WALLABY is expected to detect around half a million galaxies with a mean redshift of z ∼0.05 (∼200 Mpc). The scientific goals of WALLABY include: (a) a census of gas-rich galaxies in the vicinity of the Local Group; (b) a study of the HI properties of galaxies, groups and clusters, in particular the influence of the environment on galaxy evolution; and (c) the refinement of cosmological parameters using the spatial and redshift distribution of low-bias gas-rich galaxies. For context we provide an overview of recent and planned large-scale HI surveys. Combined with existing and new multi-wavelength sky surveys, WALLABY will enable an exciting new generation of panchromatic studies of the Local Universe. — First results from the WALLABY pilot survey are revealed, with initial data products publicly available in the CSIRO ASKAP Science Data Archive (CASDA).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020Ap&SS.365..118K
A Search for Extra-tidal RR Lyrae in Globular Clusters NGC 5024 and NGC 5053;;Recently, Kundu et al. reported that the globular cluster NGC 5024 (M53) possesses five extra-tidal RR Lyrae. In fact, four of them were instead known members of a nearby globular cluster NGC 5053. The status of the remaining extra-tidal RR Lyrae is controversial depending on the adopted tidal radius of NGC 5024. We have also searched for additional extra-tidal RR Lyrae within an area of ∼8 deg<SUP>2</SUP> covering both globular clusters. This includes other known RR Lyrae within the search area, as well as stars that fall within the expected range of magnitudes and colors for RR Lyrae (and yet outside the cutoff of two-thirds of the tidal radii of each globular cluster for something to be called extra-tidal) if they were extra-tidal RR Lyrae candidates for NGC 5024 or NGC 5053. Based on the the proper-motion information and their locations on the color-magnitude diagram, none of the known RR Lyrae belong to the extra-tidal RR Lyrae of either globular clusters. In the cases where the stars satisfied the magnitude and color ranges of RR Lyrae, analysis of time series data taken from the Zwicky Transient Facility do not reveal periodicities, suggesting that none of these stars are RR Lyrae. We conclude that there are no extra-tidal RR Lyrae associated with either NGC 5024 or NGC 5053 located within our search area.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160...31N
Characterization of the Nucleus, Morphology, and Activity of Interstellar Comet 2I/Borisov by Optical and Near-infrared GROWTH, Apache Point, IRTF, ZTF, and Keck Observations;;We present visible and near-infrared (NIR) photometric and spectroscopic observations of interstellar object (ISO) 2I/Borisov taken from 2019 September 10 to 2019 December 20 using the GROWTH, the Apache Point Observatory Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5 m, and the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility 3.0 m combined with pre- and postdiscovery observations of 2I obtained by the Zwicky Transient Facility from 2019 March 17 to 2019 May 5. Comparison with imaging of distant solar system comets shows an object very similar to mildly active solar system comets with an outgassing rate of ∼10<SUP>27</SUP> mol s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The photometry, taken in filters spanning the visible and NIR range, shows a gradual brightening trend of ∼0.03 mag day<SUP>-1</SUP> since 2019 September 10 UTC for a reddish object becoming neutral in the NIR. The light curve from recent and prediscovery data reveals a brightness trend suggesting the recent onset of significant H<SUB>2</SUB>O sublimation with the comet being active with super volatiles such as CO at heliocentric distances >6 au consistent with its extended morphology. Using the advanced capability to significantly reduce the scattered light from the coma enabled by high-resolution NIR images from Keck adaptive optics taken on 2019 October 4, we estimate a diameter for 2I's nucleus of ≲1.4 km. We use the size estimates of 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov to roughly estimate the slope of the ISO size distribution, resulting in a slope of ∼3.4 ± 1.2, similar to solar system comets and bodies produced from collisional equilibrium.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160...26B
Beyond Gaia: Asteroseismic Distances of M Giants Using Ground-based Transient Surveys;;Evolved stars near the tip of the red giant branch show solar-like oscillations with periods spanning hours to months and amplitudes ranging from ∼1 mmag to ∼100 mmag. The systematic detection of the resulting photometric variations with ground-based telescopes would enable the application of asteroseismology to a much larger and more distant sample of stars than is currently accessible with space-based telescopes such as Kepler or the ongoing Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission. We present an asteroseismic analysis of 493 M giants using data from two ground-based surveys: the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). By comparing the extracted frequencies with constraints from Kepler, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Apache Point Observatory Galaxy Evolution Experiment, and Gaia we demonstrate that ground-based transient surveys allow accurate distance measurements to oscillating M giants with a precision of ∼15%. Using stellar population synthesis models we predict that ATLAS and ASAS-SN can provide asteroseismic distances to ∼2 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> galactic M giants out to typical distances of 20-50 kpc, vastly improving the reach of Gaia and providing critical constraints for Galactic archeology and galactic dynamics.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160...18A
Broad-line type Ic SN 2020bvc. Signatures of an off-axis gamma-ray burst afterglow;;Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are almost unequivocally associated with very energetic, broad-line supernovae of Type Ic-BL. While the gamma-ray emission is emitted in narrow jets, the SN emits radiation isotropically. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that some SN Ic-BL not associated with GRBs arise from events with inner engines such as off-axis GRBs or choked jets. Here we present observations of the nearby (d = 120 Mpc) SN 2020bvc (ASAS-SN 20bs) that support this scenario. Swift-UVOT observations reveal an early decline (up to two days after explosion), while optical spectra classify it as a SN Ic-BL with very high expansion velocities (≈70 000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), similar to that found for the jet-cocoon emission in SN 2017iuk associated with GRB 171205A. Moreover, the Swift X-Ray Telescope and CXO X-ray Observatory detected X-ray emission only three days after the SN and decaying onward, which can be ascribed to an afterglow component. Cocoon and X-ray emission are both signatures of jet-powered GRBs. In the case of SN 2020bvc, we find that the jet is off axis (by ≈23 degrees), as also indicated by the lack of early (≈1 day) X-ray emission, which explains why no coincident GRB was detected promptly or in archival data. These observations suggest that SN 2020bvc is the first orphan GRB detected through its associated SN emission.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A&A...639L..11I
The sustained post-outburst brightness of Nova Per 2018, the evolved companion, and the long orbital period;;Nova Per 2018 (= V392 Per) halted the decline from maximum when it was 2 mag brighter than quiescence and since 2019 has been stable at such a plateau. The ejecta have already fully diluted into the interstellar space. We obtained BVRIgrizY photometry and optical spectroscopy of V392 Per during the plateau phase and compared it with equivalent data gathered prior to the nova outburst. We find the companion star (CS) to be a G9 IV/III and the orbital period to be 3.4118 days, making V392 Per the longest known period for a classical nova. The location of V392 Per on the theoretical isochrones is intermediate between that of classical novae and novae erupting within symbiotic binaries, in a sense bridging the gap. The reddening is derived to be E<SUB>B - V</SUB> = 0.72 and the fitting to isochrones returns a 3.6 Gyr age for the system and 1.35 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, 5.3 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and 15 L<SUB>⊙</SUB> for the companion. The huge Ne overabundance in the ejecta and the very fast decline from nova maximum both point to a massive white dwarf (WD) (M<SUB>WD</SUB> ≥ 1.1-1.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). The system is viewed close to pole-on conditions and the current plateau phase is caused by irradiation of the CS by the WD still burning at the surface.

Probing binary neutron star mergers in dense environments using afterglow counterparts;;The only binary neutron star merger gravitational wave event with detected electromagnetic counterparts recorded to date is GRB170817A. This merger occurred in a rarefied medium with a density smaller than 10<SUP>-3</SUP> - 10<SUP>-2</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. Since kicks are imparted to neutron star binaries upon formation, and due to their long delay times before merger, such low-density circum-merger media are generally expected. However, there is some indirect evidence for fast-merging or low-kick binaries, which would coalesce in denser environments. Nonetheless, present astronomical data are largely inconclusive on the possibility of these high-density mergers. We describe a method to directly probe this hypothetical population of high-density mergers through multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star merger afterglows, exploiting the high sensitivity of these signals to the density of the merger environment. This method is based on a sample of merger afterglows that has yet to be collected. Its constraining power is large, even with a small sample of events. We discuss the method's limitations and applicability. In the upcoming era of third-generation gravitational wave detectors, this method's potential will be fully realized as it will allow us to probe mergers that occurred soon after the peak of cosmic star formation, provided the follow-up campaigns are able to locate the sources.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A&A...639A..15D
Extrasolar Enigmas: From Disintegrating Exoplanets to Exoasteroids;;Thousands of transiting exoplanets have been discovered to date, thanks in great part to the Kepler space mission. As in all populations, and certainly in the case of exoplanets, one finds unique objects with distinct characteristics. Here we will describe the properties and behaviour of a small group of 'disintegrating' exoplanets discovered over the last few years (KIC 12557548b, K2-22b, and others). They evaporate, lose mass unraveling their naked cores, produce spectacular dusty comet-like tails, and feature highly variable asymmetric transits. Apart from these exoplanets, there is observational evidence for even smaller 'exo-'objects orbiting other stars: exoasteroids and exocomets. Most probably, such objects are also behind the mystery of Boyajian's star. Ongoing and upcoming space missions such as TESS and PLATO will hopefully discover more objects of this kind, and a new era of the exploration of small extrasolar systems bodies will be upon us.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020rfma.book...45B
Radio Properties of Tidal Disruption Events;;Radio observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) probe material ejected by the disruption of stars by supermassive black holes (SMBHs), uniquely tracing the formation and evolution of jets and outflows, revealing details of the disruption hydrodynamics, and illuminating the environments around previously-dormant SMBHs. To date, observations reveal a surprisingly diverse population. A small fraction of TDEs (at most a few percent) have been observed to produce radio-luminous mildly relativistic jets. The remainder of the population are radio quiet, producing less luminous jets, non-relativistic outflows or, possibly, no radio emission at all. Here, we review the radio observations that have been made of TDEs to date and discuss possible explanations for their properties, focusing on detected sources and, in particular, on the two best-studied events: Sw J1644+57 and ASASSN-14li. We also discuss what we have learned about the host galaxies of TDEs from radio observations and review constraints on the rates of bright and faint radio outflows in TDEs. Upcoming X-ray, optical, near-IR, and radio surveys will greatly expand the sample of TDEs, and technological advances open the exciting possibility of discovering a sample of TDEs in the radio band unbiased by host galaxy extinction.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020SSRv..216...81A

Candidate Electromagnetic Counterpart to the Binary Black Hole Merger Gravitational-Wave Event S190521g<SUP>*</SUP>;;We report the first plausible optical electromagnetic counterpart to a (candidate) binary black hole merger. Detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility, the electromagnetic flare is consistent with expectations for a kicked binary black hole merger in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus [B. McKernan, K. E. S. Ford, I. Bartos et al., Astrophys. J. Lett. 884, L50 (2019), 10.3847/2041-8213/ab4886] and is unlikely [<O (0.01 %) )] due to intrinsic variability of this source. The lack of color evolution implies that it is not a supernova and instead is strongly suggestive of a constant temperature shock. Other false-positive events, such as microlensing or a tidal disruption event, are ruled out or constrained to be <O (0.1 %) . If the flare is associated with S190521g, we find plausible values of total mass M<SUB>BBH</SUB>∼100 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, kick velocity v<SUB>k</SUB>∼200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> at θ ∼6 0 ° in a disk with aspect ratio H /a ∼0.01 (i.e., disk height H at radius a ) and gas density ρ ∼10<SUP>-10</SUP> g cm<SUP>-3</SUP> . The merger could have occurred at a disk migration trap (a ∼700 r<SUB>g</SUB>; r<SUB>g</SUB>≡G M<SUB>SMBH</SUB>/c<SUP>2</SUP>, where M<SUB>SMBH</SUB> is the mass of the active galactic nucleus supermassive black hole). The combination of parameters implies a significant spin for at least one of the black holes in S190521g. The timing of our spectroscopy prevents useful constraints on broad-line asymmetry due to an off-center flare. We predict a repeat flare in this source due to a reencountering with the disk in ∼1.6 yr (M<SUB>SMBH</SUB>/10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>)(a /10<SUP>3</SUP>r<SUB>g</SUB>)<SUP>3 /2</SUP> .;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhRvL.124y1102G
Search for Axionlike-Particle-Induced Prompt γ -Ray Emission from Extragalactic Core-Collapse Supernovae with the Fermi Large Area Telescope;;During a core-collapse supernova (SN), axionlike particles (ALPs) could be produced through the Primakoff process and subsequently convert into γ rays in the magnetic field of the Milky Way. We do not find evidence for such a γ -ray burst in observations of extragalactic SNe with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). The SN explosion times are estimated from optical light curves and we find a probability of about ∼90 % that the LAT observed at least one SN at the time of the core collapse. Under the assumption that at least one SN was contained within the LAT field of view, we exclude photon-ALP couplings ≳2.6 ×10<SUP>-12</SUP> GeV<SUP>-1</SUP> for ALP masses m<SUB>a</SUB>≲3 ×10<SUP>-10</SUP> eV , improving previous limits from SN1987A by a factor of 2.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhRvL.124w1101M
Physics of radiation mediated shocks and its applications to GRBs, supernovae, and neutron star mergers;;The first electromagnetic signal observed in different types of cosmic explosions is released upon emergence of a shock created in the explosion from the opaque envelope enshrouding the central source. Notable examples are the early emission from various types of supernovae and low luminosity GRBs, the prompt photospheric emission in long GRBs, and the gamma-ray emission that accompanied the gravitational wave signal in neutron star mergers. In all of these examples, the shock driven by the explosion is mediated by the radiation trapped inside it, and its velocity and structure, that depend on environmental conditions, dictate the characteristics of the observed electromagnetic emission at early times, and potentially also their neutrino emission. Much efforts have been devoted in recent years to develop a detailed theory of radiation mediated shocks in an attempt to predict the properties of the early emission in the aforementioned systems. These efforts are timely in view of the anticipated detection rate of shock breakout candidates by upcoming transient factories, and the potential detection of a gamma-ray flash from shock breakout in neutron star mergers like GW170817. This review aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the theory and applications of radiation mediated shocks, starting from basic principles. The classification of shock solutions, which are governed by the conditions prevailing in each class of objects, and the methods used to solve the shock equations in different regimes will be described, with particular emphasis on the observational diagnostics. The applications to supernovae, low-luminosity GRBs, long GRBs, neutron star mergers, and neutrino emission will be highlighted.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhR...866....1L
Synthetic Tracking Using ZTF Deep Drilling Data Sets;;The Zwicky Transit Facility (ZTF) is a powerful time domain survey telescope with a large field of view of 47 ${\deg }^{2}$ deg 2 . We apply the synthetic tracking technique to integrate a ZTF's deep drilling data set, which consists of 133 nominal 30 s exposure frames spanning about 1.5 hr, to search for slowly moving asteroids down to approximately 23rd magnitude. We found 1168 objects from searching 40 of the 64 CCD-quadrant subfields, each of which covers a field size of about 0.73 ${\deg }^{2}$ deg 2 . While most of the objects are in the core region of the asteroid belt, there are asteroids belonging to families of Trojan, Hilda, Hungaria, Phocaea, and near-Earth-asteroids. Such an approach is effective and productive for discovering new asteroids. Here we report the data processing and results as well as discuss a potential deep drilling operation mode using this approach for survey facilities.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132f4502Z
First detection of two superoutbursts during the rebrightening phase of a WZ Sge-type dwarf nova: TCP J21040470+4631129;;We report on photometric and spectroscopic observations and analysis of the 2019 superoutburst of TCP J21040470+4631129. This object showed a 9 mag superoutburst with early superhumps and ordinary superhumps, which are the features of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. Five rebrightenings were observed after the main superoutburst. The spectra during the post-superoutburst stage showed Balmer, He i, and possible sodium doublet features. The mass ratio is derived as 0.0880(9) from the period of the superhump. During the third and fifth rebrightenings, growing superhumps and superoutbursts were observed, which have never been detected during a rebrightening phase among WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings. To induce a superoutburst during the brightening phase, the accretion disk needs to have expanded beyond the 3 : 1 resonance radius of the system again after the main superoutburst. These peculiar phenomena can be explained by the enhanced viscosity and large radius of the accretion disk suggested by the higher luminosity and the presence of late-stage superhumps during the post-superoutburst stage, plus by more mass supply from the cool mass reservoir and/or from the secondary because of the enhanced mass transfer than those of other WZ Sge-type dwarf novae.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASJ...72...49T
Fabrication and Piezoresistive/Piezoelectric Sensing Characteristics of Carbon Nanotube/PVA/Nano-ZnO Flexible Composite;;Flexible sensors with a high sensitivity and wide-frequency response are essential for structural health monitoring (SHM) while they are attached. Here, carbon nanotube (CNT) films doped with various PVA fractions (CNT/PVA) and ZnO nanowires (nano-ZnO) on zinc sheets were first fabricated by functionalized self-assembly and hydrothermal synthesis processes. A CNT/PVA/nano-ZnO flexible composite (CNT/PVA/ZnO) sandwiched with a zinc wafer was then prepared by the spin-coating method. The piezoresistive and/or piezoelectric capabilities of the CNT/PVA/ZnO composite were comprehensively investigated under cyclic bending and impact loading after it was firmly adhered to a substrate (polypropylene sheet or mortar plate). The results show that the piezoresistive sensitivity and linear stability of the CNT/PVA films doped with 20%, 50%, and 100% PVA during bending are 5.47%/mm, 11.082%/mm, and 11.95%/mm and 2.3%, 3.42%, and 4.78%, respectively. The piezoelectric sensitivity, linear stability, and response accuracy of the CNT/PVA/ZnO composite under impulse loading are 4.87 mV/lbf, 3.42%, and 1.496 ms, respectively. These merits support the use of CNT/PVA/ZnO as a piezoresistive and/or piezoelectric compound sensor to monitor the static/dynamic loads on concrete structures while it is attached.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020NatSR..10.8895C
On building a cluster watchlist for identifying strongly lensed supernovae, gravitational waves and kilonovae;;Motivated by discovering strongly lensed supernovae, gravitational waves, and kilonovae in the 2020s, we investigate whether to build a watchlist of clusters based on observed cluster properties (I.e. lens-plane selection) or on the detectability of strongly lensed background galaxies (I.e. source-plane selection). First, we estimate the fraction of high-redshift transient progenitors that reside in galaxies that are themselves too faint to be detected as being strongly lensed. We find ∼15-50 per cent of transient progenitors reside in z = 1 - 2 galaxies too faint to be detected in surveys that reach AB ≃ 23, such as the Dark Energy Survey. This falls to ≲10 per cent at depths that will be probed by early data releases of LSST (AB ≃ 25). Secondly, we estimate a conservative lower limit on the fraction of strong-lensing clusters that will be missed by magnitude-limited searches for multiply imaged galaxies and giant arcs due to the faintness of such images. We find that DES-like surveys will miss ∼75 per cent of 10<SUP>15</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> strong-lensing clusters, rising to ∼100 per cent of 10<SUP>14</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> clusters. Deeper surveys, such as LSST, will miss ∼40 per cent at 10<SUP>15</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and ∼95 per cent at 10<SUP>14</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>.

Correlation between optical and UV variability of a large sample of quasars;;The variability of quasars across multiple wavelengths is a useful probe of physical conditions in active galactic nuclei. In particular, variable accretion rates, instabilities, and reverberation effects in the accretion disc of a supermassive black hole are expected to produce correlated flux variations in ultraviolet (UV) and optical bands. Recent work has further argued that binary quasars should exhibit strongly correlated UV and optical periodicities. Strong UV-optical correlations have indeed been established in small samples of (N ≲ 30) quasars with well-sampled light curves, and have extended the 'bluer-when-brighter' trend previously found within the optical bands. Here, we further test the nature of quasar variability by examining the observed-frame UV-optical correlations among bright quasars extracted from the Half Million Quasars (HMQ) catalogue. We identified a large sample of 1315 quasars in HMQ with overlapping UV and optical light curves from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer and the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey, respectively. We find that strong correlations exist in this much larger sample, but we rule out, at ∼95 per cent confidence, the simple hypothesis that the intrinsic UV and optical variations of all quasars are fully correlated. Our results therefore imply the existence of physical mechanism(s) that can generate uncorrelated optical and UV flux variations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.495.1403X
AT 2016dah and AT 2017fyp: the first classical novae discovered within a tidal stream;;AT 2016dah and AT 2017fyp are fairly typical Andromeda galaxy (M 31) classical novae. AT 2016dah is an almost text book example of a 'very fast' declining, yet uncommon, Fe II'b' (broad-lined) nova, discovered during the rise to peak optical luminosity, and decaying with a smooth broken power-law light curve. AT 2017fyp is classed as a 'fast' nova, unusually for M 31, its early decline spectrum simultaneously shows properties of both Fe II and He/N spectral types - a 'hybrid'. Similarly, the light curve of AT 2017fyp has a broken power-law decline but exhibits an extended flat-topped maximum. Both novae were followed in the UV and X-ray by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, but no X-ray source was detected for either nova. The pair were followed photometrically and spectroscopically into their nebular phases. The progenitor systems were not visible in archival optical data, implying that the mass donors are main-sequence stars. What makes AT 2016dah and AT 2017fyp particularly interesting is their position with respect to M 31. The pair are close on the sky but are located far from the centre of M 31, lying almost along the semiminor axis of their host. Radial velocity measurements and simulations of the M 31 nova population leads to the conclusion that both novae are members of the Andromeda Giant Stellar Stream (GSS). We find the probability of at least two M 31 novae appearing coincident with the GSS by chance is $\sim \!1{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ . Therefore, we claim that these novae arose from the GSS progenitor, not M 31 - the first confirmed novae discovered in a tidal steam.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.495.1073D
The scattering of Dirac spinors in rotating spheroids;;There are many stars that are rotating spheroids in the Universe, and studying them is of very important significance. Since the times of Newton, many astronomers and physicists have researched gravitational properties of stars by considering the moment equations derived from Eulerian hydrodynamic equations. In this paper we study the scattering of spinors of the Dirac equation, and in particular investigate the scattering issue in the limit case of rotating Maclaurin spheroids. Firstly we give the metric of a rotating ellipsoid star, then write the Dirac equation under this metric, and finally derive the scattering solution to the Dirac equation and establish a relation between differential scattering cross-section, σ , and stellar matter density, μ . It is found that the sensitivity of σ to the change in μ is proportional to the density μ . Because of the weak gravitational field and the constant mass density, our results are reasonable. The results can be applied to white dwarfs, main sequence stars, red giants, supergiant stars and so on, as long as their gravitational fields are so weak that they can be treated in the Newtonan approximations, and the fluid is assumed to be incompressible. Notice that we take the star's matter density to be its average density and the star is not taken to be compact. Obviously our results cannot be used to study neutron stars and black holes. In particular, our results are suitable for white dwarfs, which have average densities of about 10<SUP>5</SUP>-10<SUP>6</SUP> g cm-<SUP>3</SUP>, corresponding to a range of mass of about 0.21 -0.61 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a range of radius of about 6000 -10 ,000 km.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020EPJC...80..582F
Search for Evolutionary Changes in the Period of the Classical Cepheid EV Aql;;The reduction of all the available photometry for the Cepheid EV Aql has allowed its $O-C$ diagram spanning a time interval of 130 years to be constructed. This has made it possible to calculate the rate of evolutionary decrease in the period, $dP/dt=-33.2({±}{6.9})$ s yr${}^{-1}$, in agreement with the results of model calculations for the second crossing of the instability strip. The pulsation stability test proposed by Lombard and Koen has confirmed that the decrease in the period is real.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AstL...46..388B
Zwicky Transient Facility Constraints on the Optical Emission from the Nearby Repeating FRB 180916.J0158+65;;The discovery rate of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is increasing dramatically thanks to new radio facilities. Meanwhile, wide-field instruments such as the 47 deg<SUP>2</SUP> Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey the optical sky to study transient and variable sources. We present serendipitous ZTF observations of the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) repeating source FRB 180916.J0158+65 that was localized to a spiral galaxy 149 Mpc away and is the first FRB suggesting periodic modulation in its activity. While 147 ZTF exposures corresponded to expected high-activity periods of this FRB, no single ZTF exposure was at the same time as a CHIME detection. No >3σ optical source was found at the FRB location in 683 ZTF exposures, totaling 5.69 hr of integration time. We combined ZTF upper limits and expected repetitions from FRB 180916.J0158+65 in a statistical framework using a Weibull distribution, agnostic of periodic modulation priors. The analysis yielded a constraint on the ratio between the optical and radio fluences of η ≲ 200, corresponding to an optical energy E<SUB>opt</SUB> ≲ 3 × 10<SUP>46</SUP> erg for a fiducial 10 Jy ms FRB (90% confidence). A deeper (but less statistically robust) constraint of η ≲ 3 can be placed assuming a rate of $r( 5\,\mathrm{Jy}\,\mathrm{ms})=1\,{\mathrm{hr}}^{-1}$ and 1.2 ± 1.1 FRB occurring during exposures taken in high-activity windows. The constraint can be improved with shorter per-image exposures and longer integration time, or observing FRBs at higher Galactic latitudes. This work demonstrated how current surveys can statistically constrain multiwavelength counterparts to FRBs even without deliberately scheduled simultaneous radio observation.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...896L...2A
A Machine Learning-based Source Property Inference for Compact Binary Mergers;;The detection of the binary neutron star merger, GW170817, was the first success story of multi-messenger observations of compact binary mergers. The inferred merger rate, along with the increased sensitivity of the ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) network in the present LIGO/Virgo, and future LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing runs, strongly hints at detections of binaries that could potentially have an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. A rapid assessment of properties that could lead to a counterpart is essential to aid time-sensitive follow-up operations, especially robotic telescopes. At minimum, the possibility of counterparts requires a neutron star (NS). Also, the tidal disruption physics is important to determine the remnant matter post-merger, the dynamics of which could result in the counterparts. The main challenge, however, is that the binary system parameters, such as masses and spins estimated from the real-time, GW template-based searches, are often dominated by statistical and systematic errors. Here, we present an approach that uses supervised machine learning to mitigate such selection effects to report the possibility of counterparts based on the presence of an NS component, and the presence of remnant matter post-merger in real time.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...896...54C
A Search for Optical AGN Variability in 35,000 Low-mass Galaxies with the Palomar Transient Factory;;We present an analysis of the long-term optical variability for ∼50,000 nearby (z < 0.055) galaxies from the NASA-Sloan Atlas, 35,000 of which are low-mass (M<SUB>*</SUB> < 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). We use difference imaging of Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) R-band observations to construct light curves with typical baselines of several years. We then search for subtle variations in the nuclear light output. We determine whether detected variability is AGN-like by assessing the fit quality to a damped random walk model. We identify 417 variability-selected AGNs, including 237 with stellar masses between 10<SUP>7</SUP> and 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. 75% of low-mass galaxies with AGN-like variability have narrow emission lines dominated by star formation. After controlling for nucleus magnitude, the fraction of variable AGNs is constant down to M<SUB>*</SUB> = 10<SUP>9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, suggesting no drastic decline in the BH occupation fraction down to this stellar mass regime. Combining our NASA-Sloan Atlas sample with samples of nearby galaxies with broad Hα emission, we find no dependence of variability properties with black hole mass. Our PTF work demonstrates the promise of long-term optical variability searches in low-mass galaxies for finding AGNs missed by other selection techniques.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...896...10B
Determining Model-independent H<SUB>0</SUB> and Consistency Tests;;We determine the Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB> precisely (2.3% uncertainty) in a manner independent of the cosmological model through Gaussian process regression, using strong lensing and supernova data. Strong gravitational lensing of a variable source can provide a time-delay distance D<SUB>Δt</SUB> and angular diameter distance to the lens D<SUB>d</SUB>. These absolute distances can anchor Type Ia supernovae, which give an excellent constraint on the shape of the distance-redshift relation. Updating our previous results to use the H0LiCOW program's milestone data set consisting of six lenses, four of which have both D<SUB>Δt</SUB> and D<SUB>d</SUB> measurements, we obtain ${H}_{0}={72.8}_{-1.7}^{+1.6}\,\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\,{\mathrm{Mpc}}^{-1}$ for a flat universe and ${H}_{0}={77.3}_{-3.0}^{+2.2}\,\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\,{\mathrm{Mpc}}^{-1}$ for a non-flat universe. We carry out several consistency checks on the data and find no statistically significant tensions, though a noticeable redshift dependence persists in a particular systematic manner that we investigate. Speculating on the possibility that this trend of derived Hubble constant with lens distance is physical, we show how this can arise through modified gravity light propagation, which would also impact the weak lensing σ<SUB>8</SUB> tension.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...895L..29L
Swift Monitoring of M51: A 38 day Superorbital Period for the Pulsar ULX7 and a New Transient Ultraluminous X-Ray Source;;We present the results from a monitoring campaign made with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory of the M51 galaxies, which contain several variable ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). The ongoing campaign started in 2018 May, and we report here on ∼1.5 yr of observations. The campaign, which consists of 106 observations, has a typical cadence of 3-6 days, and has the goal of determining the long-term X-ray variability of the ULXs. Two of the most variable sources were ULX7 and ULX8, both of which are known to be powered by neutron stars that are exceeding their isotropic Eddington luminosities by factors of up to 100. This is further evidence that neutron-star-powered ULXs are the most variable. Our two main results are, first, that ULX7 exhibits a periodic flux modulation with a period of 38 days varying over a magnitude and a half in flux from peak to trough. Since the orbital period of the system is known to be 2 days, the modulation is superorbital, which is a near-ubiquitous property of ULX pulsars. Second, we identify a new transient ULX, M51 XT-1, the onset of which occurred during our campaign, reaching a peak luminosity of ∼10<SUP>40</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, before gradually fading over the next ∼200 days until it slipped below the detection limit of our observations. Combined with the high-quality Swift/X-ray Telescope lightcurve of the transient, serendipitous observations made with Chandra and XMM-Newton provide insights into the onset and evolution of a likely super-Eddington event.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...895..127B
A Deep CFHT Optical Search for a Counterpart to the Possible Neutron Star-Black Hole Merger GW190814;;We present a wide-field optical imaging search for electromagnetic counterparts to the likely neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) merger GW190814/S190814bv. This compact binary merger was detected through gravitational waves by the LIGO/Virgo interferometers, with masses suggestive of an NS-BH merger. We imaged the LIGO/Virgo localization region using the MegaCam instrument on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). We describe our hybrid observing strategy of both tiling and galaxy-targeted observations, as well as our image differencing and transient detection pipeline. Our observing campaign produced some of the deepest multiband images of the region between 1.7 and 8.7 days post-merger, reaching a 5σ depth of g > 22.8 (AB mag) at 1.7 days and I > 23.1 and I > 23.9 at 3.7 and 8.7 days, respectively. These observations cover a mean total integrated probability of 67.0% of the localization region. We find no compelling candidate transient counterparts to this merger in our images, which suggests that the lighter object was tidally disrupted inside of the BH's innermost stable circular orbit, the transient lies outside of the observed sky footprint, or the lighter object is a low-mass BH. We use 5σ source detection upper limits from our images in the NS-BH interpretation of this merger to constrain the mass of the kilonova ejecta to be M<SUB>ej</SUB> ≲ 0. 015M<SUB>⊙</SUB> for a "blue" ( $\kappa =0.5\,{\mathrm{cm}}^{2}\ {{\rm{g}}}^{-1}$ ) kilonova and M<SUB>ej</SUB> ≲ 0. 04M<SUB>⊙</SUB> for a "red" ( $\kappa =5\mbox{--}10\,{\mathrm{cm}}^{2}\ {{\rm{g}}}^{-1}$ ) kilonova. Our observations emphasize the key role of large-aperture telescopes and wide-field imagers such as CFHT MegaCam in enabling deep searches for electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational-wave events.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...895...96V
Catalogue of new Herbig Ae/Be and classical Be stars. A machine learning approach to Gaia DR2;;Context. The intermediate-mass pre-main sequence Herbig Ae/Be stars are key to understanding the differences in formation mechanisms between low- and high-mass stars. The study of the general properties of these objects is hampered by the lack of a well-defined, homogeneous sample, and because few and mostly serendipitously discovered sources are known. 
 Aims: Our goal is to identify new Herbig Ae/Be candidates to create a homogeneous and well defined catalogue of these objects. 
 Methods: We have applied machine learning techniques to 4 150 983 sources with data from Gaia DR2, 2MASS, WISE, and IPHAS or VPHAS+. Several observables were chosen to identify new Herbig Ae/Be candidates based on our current knowledge of this class, which is characterised by infrared excesses, photometric variabilities, and Hα emission lines. Classical techniques are not efficient for identifying new Herbig Ae/Be stars mainly because of their similarity with classical Be stars, with which they share many characteristics. By focusing on disentangling these two types of objects, our algorithm has also identified new classical Be stars. 
 Results: We have obtained a large catalogue of 8470 new pre-main sequence candidates and another catalogue of 693 new classical Be candidates with a completeness of 78.8 ± 1.4% and 85.5 ± 1.2%, respectively. Of the catalogue of pre-main sequence candidates, at least 1361 sources are potentially new Herbig Ae/Be candidates according to their position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. In this study we present the methodology used, evaluate the quality of the catalogues, and perform an analysis of their flaws and biases. For this assessment, we make use of observables that have not been accounted for by the algorithm and hence are selection-independent, such as coordinates and parallax based distances. The catalogue of new Herbig Ae/Be stars that we present here increases the number of known objects of the class by an order of magnitude.

A Real-time Automatic Validation System for Optical Transients Detected by GWAC;;The ground-based wide-angle camera array generates millions of single frame alerts per night. After the complicated and elaborate filters by multiple methods, a couple of dozens of candidates are still needed to be confirmed by follow-up observations in real-time. In order to free scientists from the complex and high-intensity follow-up tasks, we developed a Real-time Automatic transient Validation System (RAVS), and introduce here its system architecture, data processing flow, database schema, automatic follow-up control flow, and mobile message notification solution. This system is capable of automatically carrying out all operations in real-time without human intervention, including the validation of transient candidates, the adaptive light-curve sampling for identified targets in multi-band, and the pushing of observation results to the mobile client. The running of RAVS shows that an M-type stellar flare event can be well sampled by RAVS without a significant loss of the details, while the observing time is only less than one-third of the time coverage. Because the control logic of RAVS is designed to be independent of the telescope hardware, RAVS can be conveniently transplanted to other telescopes, especially the follow-up system of SVOM. Some future improvements are presented for the adaptive light-curve sampling, after taking into account both the brightness of sources and the evolution trends of the corresponding light-curves.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132e4502X
ZTF J1901+5309: a 40.6-min orbital period eclipsing double white dwarf system;;The Zwicky Transient Facility has begun to discover binary systems with orbital periods that are less than 1 h. Combined with dedicated follow-up systems, which allow for high-cadence photometry of these sources, systematic confirmation and characterization of these sources are now possible. Here, we report the discovery of ZTF J190125.42+530929.5, a 40.6-min orbital period, eclipsing double white dwarf binary. Both photometric modelling and spectroscopic modelling confirm its nature, yielding an estimated inclination of I = 86.2<SUP>+0.6</SUP><SUB>-0.2</SUB> ° and primary and secondary effective temperatures of T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 28,000<SUP>+500</SUP><SUB>-500</SUB> and 17,600<SUP>+400</SUP><SUB>-400</SUB> K, respectively. This system adds to a growing list of sources for future gravitational-wave detectors and contributes to the demographic analysis of double degenerates.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494L..91C
Finding binary black holes in the Milky Way with LISA;;We determine the main properties of the Galactic binary black hole (BBH) population detectable by Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and strategies to distinguish them from the much more numerous white dwarf binaries. We simulate BBH populations based on cosmological simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies and binary evolution models. We then determine their gravitational wave emission as observed by LISA and build mock catalogues. According to our model, LISA will detect ≈4 (6) BBHs assuming 4 (10) yr of operations. Those figures grow to ≈6 (9) when models are re-normalized to the inferred LIGO/Virgo merger rates. Largely independent on mass and distance, sources emitting at f > 0.5 mHz - 40 per cent (70 per cent) of the detections - have a measurable frequency drift, which allows a good enough chirp mass measurement to separate them from the much lighter white dwarf and neutron star binaries. Most of the remaining, lower frequency, sources should be identifiable by their lack of electromagnetic (EM) counterpart within ≈100 pc. These results are robust with respect to the current uncertainties of the BBH merger rate as measured by LIGO/Virgo as well as the global mass spectrum of the binaries. Based on the LIGO/Virgo merger rate, we determine that there is a 94 per cent chance that LISA finds at least one of these systems within 4 yr, which will allow us to pinpoint the conditions where they were formed and possibly find unique EM signatures.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494L..75S
Asteroid belt survival through stellar evolution: dependence on the stellar mass;;Polluted white dwarfs are generally accreting terrestrial-like material that may originate from a debris belt like the asteroid belt in the Solar system. The fraction of white dwarfs that are polluted drops off significantly for white dwarfs with masses $M_{\rm WD}rsim 0.8\, \rm M_\odot$ . This implies that asteroid belts and planetary systems around main-sequence (MS) stars with mass $M_{\rm MS}rsim 3\, \rm M_\odot$ may not form because of the intense radiation from the star. This is in agreement with current debris disc and exoplanet observations. The fraction of white dwarfs that show pollution also drops off significantly for low-mass white dwarfs $(M_{\rm WD}\lesssim 0.55\, \rm M_\odot)$ . However, the low-mass white dwarfs that do show pollution are not currently accreting but have accreted in the past. We suggest that asteroid belts around MS stars with masses $M_{\rm MS}\lesssim 2\, \rm M_\odot$ are not likely to survive the stellar evolution process. The destruction likely occurs during the AGB phase and could be the result of interactions of the asteroids with the stellar wind, the high radiation, or, for the lowest mass stars that have an unusually close-in asteroid belt, scattering during the tidal orbital decay of the inner planetary system.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494L..17M
On the orbital evolution of 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB>, the first asteroid ever observed to go around the Sun inside the orbit of Venus;;The innermost section of the Solar system has not been extensively studied because minor bodies moving inside Earth's orbit tend to spend most of their sidereal orbital periods at very low solar elongation, well away from the areas more frequently observed by programs searching for near-Earth objects. The survey carried out from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is the first one that has been able to detect multiple asteroids well detached from the direct gravitational perturbation of the Earth-Moon system. ZTF discoveries include 2019 AQ<SUB>3</SUB> and 2019 LF<SUB>6</SUB>, two Atiras with the shortest periods among known asteroids. Here, we perform an assessment of the orbital evolution of 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB>, an Atira found by ZTF with a similarly short period but following a path contained entirely within the orbit of Venus. This property makes it the first known member of the elusive Vatira population. Genuine Vatiras, those long-term dynamically stable, are thought to be subjected to the so-called von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillation that protects them against close encounters with both Mercury and Venus. However, 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB> appears to be a former Atira that entered the Vatira orbital domain relatively recently. It displays an anticoupled oscillation of the values of eccentricity and inclination, but the value of the argument of perihelion may circulate. Simulations show that 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB> might reach a 3:2 resonant orbit with Venus in the future, activating the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism, which in turn opens the possibility to the existence of a long-term stable population of Vatiras trapped in this configuration.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494L...6D
A Volume-limited Sample of Cataclysmic Variables from Gaia DR2: Space Density and Population Properties;;We present the first volume-limited sample of cataclysmic variables (CVs), selected using the accurate parallaxes provided by the second data release (DR2) of the European Space Agency Gaia space mission. The sample is composed of 42 CVs within 150 pc, including two new systems discovered using the Gaia data, and is $(77 \pm 10)$ per cent complete. We use this sample to study the intrinsic properties of the Galactic CV population. In particular, the CV space density we derive, $\rho =(4.8^{+0.6}_{-0.8}) \times 10^{-6}\, \mbox{$\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$}$, is lower than that predicted by most binary population synthesis studies. We also find a low fraction of period bounce CVs, seven per cent, and an average white dwarf mass of $\langle M_\mathrm{WD} \rangle = (0.83 \pm 0.17)\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ . Both findings confirm previous results, ruling out the presence of observational biases affecting these measurements, as has been suggested in the past. The observed fraction of period bounce CVs falls well below theoretical predictions, by at least a factor of five, and remains one of the open problems in the current understanding of CV evolution. Conversely, the average white dwarf mass supports the presence of additional mechanisms of angular momentum loss that have been accounted for in the latest evolutionary models. The fraction of magnetic CVs in the 150 pc sample is remarkably high at 36 per cent. This is in striking contrast with the absence of magnetic white dwarfs in the detached population of CV progenitors, and underlines that the evolution of magnetic systems has to be included in the next generation of population models.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494.3799P
Near-infrared variability in dusty white dwarfs: tracing the accretion of planetary material;;The inwards scattering of planetesimals towards white dwarfs is expected to be a stochastic process with variability on human time-scales. The planetesimals tidally disrupt at the Roche radius, producing dusty debris detectable as excess infrared emission. When sufficiently close to the white dwarf, this debris sublimates and accretes on to the white dwarf and pollutes its atmosphere. Studying this infrared emission around polluted white dwarfs can reveal how this planetary material arrives in their atmospheres. We report a near-infrared monitoring campaign of 34 white dwarfs with infrared excesses with the aim to search for variability in the dust emission. Time series photometry of these white dwarfs from the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (Wide Field Camera) in the J-, H-, and K-bands was obtained over baselines of up to 3 yr. We find no statistically significant variation in the dust emission in all three near-infrared bands. Specifically, we can rule out variability at ∼1.3 per cent for the 13 white dwarfs brighter than 16th mag in K-band, and at ∼10 per cent for the 32 white dwarfs brighter than 18th mag over time-scales of 3 yr. Although to date two white dwarfs, SDSS J095904.69-020047.6 and WD 1226+110, have shown K-band variability, in our sample we see no evidence of new K-band variability at these levels. One interpretation is that the tidal disruption events that lead to large variabilities are rare occur on short time-scales, and after a few years the white dwarfs return to being stable in the near-infrared.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494.2861R
Generating metal-polluting debris in white dwarf planetary systems from small-impact crater ejecta;;Metal pollution in white dwarf photospheres originates from the accretion of some combination of planets, moons, asteroids, comets, boulders, pebbles, and dust. When large bodies reside in dynamically stagnant locations - unable themselves to pollute or even closely approach the white dwarf - then smaller reservoirs of impact debris may become a complementary or the primary source of metal pollutants. Here, we take a first step towards exploring this possibility by computing limits on the recoil mass that escapes the gravitational pull of the target object following a single impact onto an atmosphere-less surface. By considering vertical impacts only with the full-chain analytical prescription from Kurosawa & Takada, we provide lower bounds for the ejected mass for basalt, granite, iron, and water-rich target objects across the radii range 10<SUP>0</SUP>-10<SUP>3</SUP> km. Our use of the full-chain prescription as opposed to physical experiments or hydrocode simulations allows us to quickly sample a wide range of parameter space appropriate to white dwarf planetary systems. Our numerical results could be used in future studies to constrain freshly generated small debris reservoirs around white dwarfs given a particular planetary system architecture, bombardment history, and impact geometries.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494..442V
An Extension of the Athena++ Framework for General Equations of State;;We present modifications to the Athena++ framework to enable the use of general equations of state (EOS). A part of our motivation for doing so is to model transient astrophysics phenomena, as these types of events are often not well approximated by an ideal gas. This necessitated changes to the Riemann solvers implemented in Athena++. We discuss the adjustments made to the Harten-Lax-van Leer-Contact and Harten-Lax-van Leer-Discontinuities solvers and EOS calls required for arbitrary EOS. We demonstrate the reliability of our code in a number of tests that utilize a relatively simple, but nontrivial, EOS based on hydrogen ionization, appropriate for the transition from atomic to ionized hydrogen. Additionally, we perform tests using an electron-positron Helmholtz EOS, appropriate for regimes where nuclear statistical equilibrium is a good approximation. These new complex EOS tests overall show that our modifications to Athena++ accurately solve the Riemann problem with linear convergence and linear wave tests with quadratic convergence. We provide our test solutions as a means to check the accuracy of other hydrodynamic codes. Our tests and additions to Athena++ will enable further research into (magneto)hydrodynamic problems where realistic treatments of the EOS are required.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJS..248....7C
A Mildly Relativistic Outflow from the Energetic, Fast-rising Blue Optical Transient CSS161010 in a Dwarf Galaxy;;We present X-ray and radio observations of the Fast Blue Optical Transient CRTS-CSS161010 J045834-081803 (CSS161010 hereafter) at t = 69-531 days. CSS161010 shows luminous X-ray (L<SUB>X</SUB> ∼ 5 × 10<SUP>39</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) and radio (L<SUB>ν</SUB> ∼ 10<SUP>29</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> Hz<SUP>-1</SUP>) emission. The radio emission peaked at ∼100 days post-transient explosion and rapidly decayed. We interpret these observations in the context of synchrotron emission from an expanding blast wave. CSS161010 launched a mildly relativistic outflow with velocity Γβc ≥ 0.55c at ∼100 days. This is faster than the non-relativistic AT 2018cow (Γβc ∼ 0.1c) and closer to ZTF18abvkwla (Γβc ≥ 0.3c at 63 days). The inferred initial kinetic energy of CSS161010 (E<SUB>k</SUB> ≳ 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg) is comparable to that of long gamma-ray bursts, but the ejecta mass that is coupled to the mildly relativistic outflow is significantly larger ( $\sim 0.01\mbox{--}0.1\,{M}_{\odot }$ ). This is consistent with the lack of observed γ-rays. The luminous X-rays were produced by a different emission component to the synchrotron radio emission. CSS161010 is located at ∼150 Mpc in a dwarf galaxy with stellar mass M<SUB>*</SUB> ∼ 10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and specific star formation rate sSFR ∼ 0.3 Gyr<SUP>-1</SUP>. This mass is among the lowest inferred for host galaxies of explosive transients from massive stars. Our observations of CSS161010 are consistent with an engine-driven aspherical explosion from a rare evolutionary path of a H-rich stellar progenitor, but we cannot rule out a stellar tidal disruption event on a centrally located intermediate-mass black hole. Regardless of the physical mechanism, CSS161010 establishes the existence of a new class of rare (rate < 0.4% of the local core-collapse supernova rate) H-rich transients that can launch mildly relativistic outflows.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...895L..23C
The Rotation Curve, Mass Distribution, and Dark Matter Content of the Milky Way from Classical Cepheids;;With the increasing number of large stellar survey projects, the quality and quantity of excellent tracers for studying the Milky Way are rapidly growing, one of which is the classical Cepheids. Classical Cepheids are high-precision standard candles with very low typical uncertainties (<3%) available via the mid-infrared period-luminosity relation. About 3500 classical Cepheids identified from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernova, Gaia, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, and Zwicky Transient Facility survey data have been analyzed in this work, and their spatial distributions show a clear signature of Galactic warp. Two kinematical methods are adopted to measure the Galactic rotation curve (RC) in the Galactocentric distance range of $4\lesssim {R}_{\mathrm{GC}}\lesssim 19\,\mathrm{kpc}$ . Gently declining RCs are derived by both the proper motion (PM) method and three-dimensional velocity vector (3DV) method. The largest sample of classical Cepheids with the most accurate 6D phase-space coordinates available to date are modeled in the 3DV method, and the resulting RC is found to decline at the relatively smaller gradient of (-1.33 ± 0.1) $\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\,{\mathrm{kpc}}^{-1}$ . Comparing to results from the PM method, a higher rotation velocity ((232.5 ± 0.83) $\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ ) is derived at the position of the Sun in the 3DV method. The virial mass and local dark matter density are estimated from the 3DV method, which is the more reliable method, ${M}_{\mathrm{vir}}=(0.822\pm 0.052)\times {10}^{12}\,{M}_{\odot }$ and ${\rho }_{\mathrm{DM},\odot }=0.33\pm 0.03$ GeV, respectively.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...895L..12A
Carnegie Supernova Project-II: A New Method to Photometrically Identify Sub-types of Extreme Type Ia Supernovae;;We present a new method to photometrically delineate between various sub-types of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Using the color-stretch parameters, s<SUB>BV</SUB> or s<SUB>gr</SUB>, and the time of I-band primary maximum relative to the B-band ( ${t}_{\max }^{I-B}$ ) or g-band ( ${t}_{\max }^{I-g}$ ) maximum it is demonstrated that 2003fg-like, 1991bg-like, and 2002cx-like SNe Ia can be identified readily. In the cases of these extreme SNe Ia, their primary I-band maximum occurs after the time of the B- or g-band maxima. We suggest that the timing of the I-band maximum can reveal the physical state of the SN Ia explosion as it traces: (I) the speed of the recombination front of iron group elements in the ejecta, (II) the temperature evolution and rate of adiabatic cooling in the ejecta and, (III) the presence of interaction with a stellar envelope. This photometric sub-typing can be used in conjunction with other SNe analysis, such as the Branch diagram, to examine the physics and diversity of SNe Ia. The results here can also be used to screen out non-Ia SNe from cosmological samples that do not have complete spectroscopic typing. Finally, as future surveys like that of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (previously referred to as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope) create large databases of light curves of many objects this photometric identification can be used to readily identify and study the rates and bulk properties of peculiar SNe Ia.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...895L...3A
The Koala: A Fast Blue Optical Transient with Luminous Radio Emission from a Starburst Dwarf Galaxy at z = 0.27;;We present ZTF18abvkwla (the "Koala"), a fast blue optical transient discovered in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) One-Day Cadence (1DC) Survey. ZTF18abvkwla has a number of features in common with the groundbreaking transient AT 2018cow: blue colors at peak ( $g-r\approx -0.5$ mag), a short rise time from half-max of under two days, a decay time to half-max of only three days, a high optical luminosity ( ${M}_{g,\mathrm{peak}}\approx -20.6$ mag), a hot (≳40,000 K) featureless spectrum at peak light, and a luminous radio counterpart. At late times ( ${\rm{\Delta }}t 80\,\mathrm{days}$ ), the radio luminosity of ZTF18abvkwla ( $\nu {L}_{\nu }rsim {10}^{40}\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ at 10 $\mathrm{GHz}$ , observer-frame) is most similar to that of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The host galaxy is a dwarf starburst galaxy ( $M\approx 5\times {10}^{8}\,{M}_{\odot }$ , $\mathrm{SFR}\approx 7\,{M}_{\odot }\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$ ) that is moderately metal-enriched ( $\mathrm{log}[{\rm{O}}/{\rm{H}}]\approx 8.5$ ), similar to the hosts of GRBs and superluminous supernovae. As in AT2018cow, the radio and optical emission in ZTF18abvkwla likely arise from two separate components: the radio from fast-moving ejecta ( ${\rm{\Gamma }}\beta c 0.38c$ ) and the optical from shock-interaction with confined dense material (<0.07 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> in $\sim {10}^{15}\,\mathrm{cm}$ ). Compiling transients in the literature with ${t}_{\mathrm{rise}} 5\,\mathrm{days}$ and ${M}_{\mathrm{peak}} -20$ mag, we find that a significant number are engine-powered, and suggest that the high peak optical luminosity is directly related to the presence of this engine. From 18 months of the 1DC survey, we find that transients in this rise-luminosity phase space are at least two to three orders of magnitude less common than CC SNe. Finally, we discuss strategies for identifying such events with future facilities like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, as well as prospects for detecting accompanying X-ray and radio emission.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...895...49H
Evaluation of Automated Fermi GBM Localizations of Gamma-Ray Bursts;;The capability of the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) to localize gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is evaluated for two different automated algorithms: the GBM Team's RoboBA algorithm and the independently developed BALROG algorithm. Through a systematic study utilizing over 500 GRBs with known locations from instruments like Swift and the Fermi Large Area Telescope, we directly compare the effectiveness of, and accurately estimate the systematic uncertainty for, both algorithms. We show that simple adjustments to the GBM Team's RoboBA, in operation since early 2016, yield significant improvement in the systematic uncertainty, removing the long tail identified in the systematic, and improve the overall accuracy. The systematic uncertainty for the updated RoboBA localizations is 1°8 for 52% of GRBs and 4°1 for the remaining 48%. Both from public reporting by BALROG and our systematic study, we find the systematic uncertainty of 1°-2° quoted in circulars for bright GRBs is an underestimate of the true magnitude of the systematic, which we find to be 2°7 for 74% of GRBs and 33° for the remaining 26%. We show that, once the systematic uncertainty is considered, the RoboBA 90% localization confidence regions can be more than an order of magnitude smaller in area than those produced by BALROG.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...895...40G
The Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey. I. Spectroscopic Classification and the Redshift Completeness of Local Galaxy Catalogs;;The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is performing a three-day cadence survey of the visible northern sky (∼3π) with newly found transient candidates announced via public alerts. The ZTF Bright Transient Survey (BTS) is a large spectroscopic campaign to complement the photometric survey. BTS endeavors to spectroscopically classify all extragalactic transients with m<SUB>peak</SUB> ≤ 18.5 mag in either the g<SUB>ZTF</SUB> or r<SUB>ZTF</SUB> filters, and publicly announce said classifications. BTS discoveries are predominantly supernovae (SNe), making this the largest flux-limited SN survey to date. Here we present a catalog of 761 SNe, classified during the first nine months of ZTF (2018 April 1-2018 December 31). We report BTS SN redshifts from SN template matching and spectroscopic host-galaxy redshifts when available. We analyze the redshift completeness of local galaxy catalogs, the redshift completeness fraction (RCF; the ratio of SN host galaxies with known spectroscopic redshift prior to SN discovery to the total number of SN hosts). Of the 512 host galaxies with SNe Ia, 227 had previously known spectroscopic redshifts, yielding an RCF estimate of 44% ± 4%. The RCF decreases with increasing distance and decreasing galaxy luminosity (for z < 0.05, or ∼200 Mpc, RCF ≈ 0.6). Prospects for dramatically increasing the RCF are limited to new multifiber spectroscopic instruments or wide-field narrowband surveys. Existing galaxy redshift catalogs are only ∼50% complete at r ≈ 16.9 mag. Pushing this limit several magnitudes deeper will pay huge dividends when searching for electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events or sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays or neutrinos.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...895...32F
Examining a Peak-luminosity/Decline-rate Relationship for Tidal Disruption Events;;We compare the luminosity, radius, and temperature evolution of the UV/optical blackbodies for 21 well-observed tidal disruption events (TDEs), 8 of which were discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae. We find that the blackbody radii generally increase prior to peak and slowly decline at late times. The blackbody temperature evolution is generally flat, with a few objects showing small-scale variations. The bolometric UV/optical luminosities generally evolve smoothly and flatten out at late times. Finally, we find an apparent correlation between the peak luminosity and the decline rate of TDEs. This relationship is strongest when comparing the peak luminosity to its decline over 40 days. A linear fit yields ${\mathrm{log}}_{10}({L}_{\mathrm{peak}})$ = $({44.1}_{-0.1}^{+0.1})$ + $({1.6}_{-0.2}^{+0.4})({\rm{\Delta }}{L}_{40}+0.5)$ in cgs, where ${\rm{\Delta }}{L}_{40}={\mathrm{log}}_{10}({L}_{40}/{L}_{\mathrm{peak}})$.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...894L..10H
The Gravitational Wave Treasure Map: A Tool to Coordinate, Visualize, and Assess the Electromagnetic Follow-up of Gravitational-wave Events;;We present the Gravitational Wave (GW) Treasure Map, a tool to coordinate, visualize, and assess the electromagnetic (EM) followup of GW events. With typical GW localization regions of hundreds to thousands of square degrees and dozens of active follow-up groups, the pursuit of EM counterparts is a challenging endeavor, but the scientific payoff for early discovery of any counterpart is clear. With this tool, we provide a website and an application programming interface (API) that allows users to easily see where other groups have searched and better inform their own follow-up search efforts. A strong community of Treasure Map users will increase the overall efficiency of EM counterpart searches and will play a fundamental role in the future of multimessenger astronomy.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...894..127W
The ELM Survey South. I. An Effective Search for Extremely Low Mass White Dwarfs;;We begin the search for extremely low mass (M ≤ 0.3M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, ELM) white dwarfs (WDs) in the southern sky based on photometry from the VST ATLAS and SkyMapper surveys. We use a similar color selection method as the Hypervelocity star survey. We switched to an astrometric selection once Gaia Data Release 2 became available. We use the previously known sample of ELM white dwarfs to demonstrate that these objects occupy a unique parameter space in parallax and magnitude. We use the SOAR 4.1 m telescope to test the Gaia-based selection, and identify more than two dozen low mass white dwarfs, including six new ELM white dwarf binaries with periods as short as 2 h. The better efficiency of the Gaia-based selection enables us to extend the ELM Survey footprint to the southern sky. We confirm one of our candidates, J0500-0930, to be the brightest (G = 12.6 mag) and closest (d = 72 pc) ELM white dwarf binary currently known. Remarkably, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) full-frame imaging data on this system reveals low-level (<0.1%) but significant variability at the orbital period of this system (P = 9.5 hr), likely from the relativistic beaming effect. TESS data on another system, J0642-5605, reveals ellipsoidal variations due to a tidally distorted ELM WD. These demonstrate the power of TESS full-frame images in confirming the orbital periods of relatively bright compact object binaries.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...894...53K
Improving the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram with the Thomson Multitaper;;A common approach for characterizing the properties of time-series data that are evenly sampled in time is to estimate the power spectrum of the data using the periodogram. The periodogram as an estimator of the spectrum is (1) statistically inconsistent (i.e., its variance does not go to zero as infinite data are collected), (2) biased for finite samples, and (3) suffers from spectral leakage. In astronomy, time-series data are often unevenly sampled in time, and it is popular to use the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram to estimate the spectrum. Unfortunately, from a statistical standpoint, the LS periodogram suffers from the same issues as the classical periodogram and has even worse spectral leakage. Here, we present an improvement on the LS periodogram by combining it with the Thomson multitaper approach. The multitaper spectral estimator is well established in the statistics and engineering literature for evenly sampled time series. It is attractive because it directly trades off bias and variance for frequency resolution, and is fast to compute: compared to an untapered spectral estimator, the multitaper adds no more than a couple of seconds for a time series with a million data points on a current desktop computer. Here, we describe an estimator that combines the multitaper with the LS periodogram. We show examples in which this new approach has improved properties compared to traditional approaches in the case of unevenly sampled time series. Finally, we demonstrate an application of the method to astronomy with an application to Kepler data.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....159..205S
Cataclysmic Variables in the First Year of the Zwicky Transient Facility;;Using selection criteria based on amplitude, time, and color, we have identified 329 objects as known or candidate cataclysmic variables (CVs) during the first year of testing and operation of the Zwicky Transient Facility. Of these, 90 are previously confirmed CVs, 218 are strong candidates based on the shape and color of their light curves obtained during 3-562 days of observation, and the remaining 21 are possible CVs but with too few data points to be listed as good candidates. Almost half of the strong candidates are within 10 deg of the galactic plane, in contrast to most other large surveys that have avoided crowded fields. The available Gaia parallaxes are consistent with sampling the low mass transfer CVs, as predicted by population models. Our follow-up spectra have confirmed Balmer/helium emission lines in 27 objects, with four showing high-excitation He II emission, including candidates for an AM CVn, a polar, and an intermediate polar. Our results demonstrate that a complete survey of the Galactic plane is needed to accomplish an accurate determination of the number of CVs existing in the Milky Way.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....159..198S
Subsequent outbursts of the same EXor source possibly present similar features;;Context. V1118 Ori is a classical EXor source whose light curve has been monitored, although not continuously, over the past 30 years. This source underwent a powerful outburst in 2005, followed by 10 years of quiescence and a less intense outburst in 2015. In 2019, a new intense brightness increase was observed (Δg ∼ 3 mag). 
 Aims: This new accretion episode offers the opportunity to compare the photometric and spectroscopic properties of multiple outbursts of the same source. This allows us to highlight the differences and similarities among various events by removing any possible bias related to the intrinsic properties of the star-disk system. 
 Methods: We discovered the 2019 V1118 Ori outburst by examining the g-band light curve acquired by the Zwicky Transient Facility and followed the declining phase with the Rapid Eye Mount telescope in the griz bands. Two near-infrared spectra were also acquired at different brightness stages with the Large Binocular Telescope. 
 Results: The last event shows the following characteristics: (1) an amplitude similar to that of 2015 and lower than that of 2005; (2) a duration of less than one year as in previous events; (3) a increasing (decreasing) speed of 0.018 (0.031) mag day<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is different from previous cases; (4) a gradually blueing of the [g - r] color is observed over time, while the [r - i] color remains roughly unchanged; (5) with few exceptions, the near-infrared lines (mainly H I recombination) are the same as those observed in 2015; and (6) the mass accretion rate peaks at Ṁ<SUB>acc</SUB> ∼ 10<SUP>-7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> and decreases in about a month down to a few 10<SUP>-8</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. 
 Conclusions: Our analysis shows that the comparison of data from different outbursts of the same source is a nontrivial exercise, which allows us to obtain important clues that are useful to drive theoretical efforts toward a better understanding of the EXor phenomenon.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A&A...637A..83G
Identification of 3XMM J000511.8+634018 as a new polar at P<SUB>orb</SUB> = 133.5 min - is it inside or outside the period gap?;;
 Aims: We aimed to identify the variable X-ray source 3XMM J000511.8+634018, which was serendipitously discovered through routine inspections while the 3XMM catalogue was compiled. 
 Methods: We analysed the archival XMM-Newton observation of the source, obtained BUSCA photometry in three colours, and performed optical spectroscopy with the LBT. These data were supplemented by archival observations from the Zwicky Transient Facility. 
 Results: Based on its optical and X-ray properties, 3XMM J000511.8+634018 is classified as a magnetic cataclysmic variable, or polar. The flux is modulated with a period of 2.22 h (8009.1 ± 0.2 s), which we identify with the orbital period. The bright phases are highly variable in X-ray luminosity from one cycle to the next. The source shows a thermal plasma spectrum typical of polars without evidence of a luminous soft blackbody-like component. It is non-eclipsing and displays one-pole accretion. The X-ray and BUSCA light curves show a stream absorption dip, which suggests an inclination 50° < i < 75°. The phasing of this feature, which occurs at the end of the bright phase, requires a somewhat special accretion geometry with a stream running far around the white dwarf before it is magnetically channelled. The period of this polar falls within the period gap of the cataclysmic variables (2.15-3.18 h), but appears to fall just below the minimum period when only polars are considered.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A&A...637A..35S
AT 2019abn: multi-wavelength observations over the first 200 days;;Context. AT 2019abn was discovered in the nearby M51 galaxy by the Zwicky Transient Facility at more than two magnitudes and around three weeks prior to its optical peak. 
 Aims: We aim to conduct a detailed photometric and spectroscopic follow-up campaign for AT 2019abn, with early discovery allowing for significant pre-maximum observations of an intermediate luminosity red transient (ILRT) for the first time. 
 Methods: This work is based on the analysis of u'BVr'i'z'H photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy using the Liverpool Telescope, medium-resolution spectroscopy with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), and near-infrared imaging with the GTC and the Nordic Optical Telescope. 
 Results: We present the most detailed optical light curve of an ILRT to date, with multi-band photometry starting around three weeks before peak brightness. The transient peaked at an observed absolute magnitude of M<SUB>r'</SUB> = -13.1, although it is subject to significant reddening from dust in M51, implying an intrinsic M<SUB>r'</SUB> ∼ -15.2. The initial light curve showed a linear, achromatic rise in magnitude before becoming bluer at peak. After peak brightness, the transient gradually cooled. This is reflected in our spectra, which at later times show absorption from such species as Fe I, Ni I and Li I. A spectrum taken around peak brightness shows narrow, low-velocity absorption lines, which we interpret as likely to originate from pre-existing circumstellar material. 
 Conclusions: We conclude that while there are some peculiarities, such as the radius evolution, AT 2019abn fits in well overall with the ILRT class of objects and is the most luminous member of the class seen to date.

DX Cygni: A triple system with mass transfer;;A dozen of new precise times of eclipses were measured for the eclipsing binary DX Cygni as a part of our long-term observational project for studying neglected eclipsing binaries with a short orbital period. Based on a current O - C diagram, we found for the first time that its period is increasing (dP / P = 1.68 ×10<SUP>-7</SUP> day/years) and that times of minima show also significant cyclical changes with a period of about 16 years, caused very probably by a third body orbiting the eclipsing pair. The minimal mass of this companion is 0.49 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The light curve solution in PHOEBE results to the typical Algol-type semidetached configuration where the secondary fills its Roche lobe. The temperature of primary component was fixed to T<SUB>1</SUB> = 5300 K according to its spectral type, which gives us T<SUB>2</SUB> = 3330 ± 20 K for the secondary. The photometric mass ratio was estimated q = 0.504 ± 0.012 . We also compare orbital parameters of selected known Algol-type eclipsing binaries with proven mass transfer and a third body.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020NewA...7601336W
Direct evidence for shock-powered optical emission in a nova;;Classical novae are thermonuclear explosions that occur on the surfaces of white dwarf stars in interacting binary systems<SUP>1</SUP>. It has long been thought that the luminosity of classical novae is powered by continued nuclear burning on the surface of the white dwarf after the initial runaway<SUP>2</SUP>. However, recent observations of gigaelectronvolt γ-rays from classical novae have hinted that shocks internal to the nova ejecta may dominate the nova emission. Shocks have also been suggested to power the luminosity of events as diverse as stellar mergers<SUP>3</SUP>, supernovae<SUP>4</SUP> and tidal disruption events<SUP>5</SUP>, but observational confirmation has been lacking. Here we report simultaneous space-based optical and γ-ray observations of the 2018 nova V906 Carinae (ASASSN-18fv), revealing a remarkable series of distinct correlated flares in both bands. The optical and γ-ray flares occur simultaneously, implying a common origin in shocks. During the flares, the nova luminosity doubles, implying that the bulk of the luminosity is shock powered. Furthermore, we detect concurrent but weak X-ray emission from deeply embedded shocks, confirming that the shock power does not appear in the X-ray band and supporting its emergence at longer wavelengths. Our data, spanning the spectrum from radio to γ-ray, provide direct evidence that shocks can power substantial luminosity in classical novae and other optical transients.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020NatAs...4..776A
Photometry of 2729 Urumqi at the Xingming Observatory in Urumqi City;;Lightcurve photometry observations of the main-belt asteroid 2729 Urumqi were made at Xingming Observatory in 2019 December. We find that the asteroid has a synodic rotation period of 3.127 ± 0.001 h and amplitude of 0.22 ± 0.01 mag. Multi-band photometric sessions shows the mean color indices of gr = 0.67 ± 0.02, and r-i = 0.20 ± 0.02 mag. According to these color indices, 2729 Urumqi can be classified as a type S asteroid.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MPBu...47..151G
First discovery of an ultra-cool white dwarf benchmark in common proper motion with an M dwarf;;Ultra-cool white dwarfs are among the oldest stellar remnants in the Universe. Their efficient gravitational settling and low effective temperatures are responsible for the smooth spectra they exhibit. For that reason, it is not possible to derive their radial velocities or to find the chemistry of the progenitors. The best that can be done is to infer such properties from associated sources, which are coeval. The simplest form of such a system is a common proper motion pair where one star is an evolved degenerate and the other a main-sequence star. In this work, we present the discovery of the first of such a system, the M dwarf LHS 6328 and the ultra-cool white dwarf PSO J1801+625, from the Pan-STARRS 1 3π survey and the Gaia Data Release 2. Follow-up spectra were collected covering a usable wavelength range of 3750-24 500 Å. Their spectra show that the white dwarf has an effective temperature of 3550 K and surface gravity of log g = 7.45 ± 0.13 or log g = 7.49 ± 0.13 for a CO or He core, respectively, when compared against synthetic spectra of ultra-cool white dwarf atmosphere models. The system has slightly subsolar metallicity with -0.25 < [Fe/H] < 0.0, and a spatial velocity of (U, V, W) = (-114.26 ± 0.24, 222.94 ± 0.60, 10.25 ± 0.34) km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, the first radial velocity and metallicity measurements of an ultra-cool white dwarf. This makes it the first and only benchmark of its kind to date.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493.6001L
Detection of gamma-ray transients with wild binary segmentation;;In the context of time domain astronomy, we present an offline detection search of gamma-ray transients using a wild binary segmentation analysis called F-WBSB targeting both short and long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and covering the soft and hard gamma-ray bands. We use NASA Fermi/GBM archival data as a training and testing data set. This paper describes the analysis applied to the 12 NaI detectors of the Fermi/GBM instrument. This includes background removal, change-point detection that brackets the peaks of gamma-ray flares, the evaluation of significance for each individual GBM detector, and the combination of the results among the detectors. We also explain the calibration of the ∼ 10 parameters present in the method using one week of archival data. Finally, we present our detection performance result for 60 d of a blind search analysis with F-WBSB by comparing to both the onboard and offline GBM search as well as external events found by others surveys such as Swift-BAT. We detect 42/44 onboard GBM events but also other gamma-ray flares at a rate of 1 per hour in the 4-50 keV band. Our results show that F-WBSB is capable of recovering gamma-ray flares, including the detection of soft X-ray long transients. FWBSB offers an independent identification of GRBs in combination with methods for determining spectral and temporal properties of the transient as well as localization. This is particularly useful for increasing the GRB rate and that will help the joint detection with gravitational-wave events.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493.4428A
Faint rapid red transients from neutron star-CO white dwarf mergers;;Mergers of neutron stars (NS) and white dwarfs (WD) may give rise to observable explosive transient events. We use 3D hydrodynamical (smoothed particle hydrodynamics - SPH) simulations and 2D hydrodynamical-thermonuclear simulations (using the FLASH adaptive mesh refinement code) to model the disruption of CO-WDs by NSs, which produce faint transient events. We post-process the simulations using a large nuclear network and make use of the SUPERNU radiation transfer code to predict the observational signatures and detailed properties of these transients. We calculate the light curves and spectra for five models of NS-CO-WD mergers. The small yields of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni (few × 10^{-3} {M_{⊙ }}) result in faint, rapidly evolving reddened transients (RRTs) with B(R) peak magnitudes of at most ∼-12 (-13) to ∼-13 (-15), much shorter and fainter than both regular and faint/peculiar Type Ia supernovae. These transients are likely to be accompanied by several months long, 1-2 mag dimmer red/infrared afterglows. We show that the spectra of RRTs share some similarities with rapidly evolving transients such as SN 2010X, although RRTs are significantly fainter, especially in the I/R bands, and show far stronger Si lines. We estimate that the upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope could detect RRTs at a rate of up to ∼10-70 yr<SUP>-1</SUP> through observations in the R/I bands. The qualitative agreement between the SPH and FLASH approaches supports the earlier hydrodynamical studies of these systems.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493.3956Z
Variability and transient search in the SUDARE-VOICE field: a new method to extract the light curves;;The VLT Survey Telescope (VST) Optical Imaging of the CDFS and ES1 Fields Survey, in synergy with the SUDARE survey, is a deep optical ugri imaging of the CDFS and ES1 fields using the VST. The observations for the CDFS field comprise about 4.38 deg<SUP>2</SUP> down to r ∼ 26 mag. The total on-sky time spans over 4 yr in this field, distributed over four adjacent sub-fields. In this paper, we use the multiepoch r-band imaging data to measure the variability of the detected objects and search for transients. We perform careful astrometric and photometric calibrations and point spread function modelling. A new method, referring to as differential running-average photometry, is proposed to measure the light curves of the detected objects. With the method, the difference of PSFs between different epochs can be reduced, and the background fluctuations are also suppressed. Detailed uncertainty analysis and detrending corrections on the light curves are performed. We visually inspect the light curves to select variable objects, and present some objects with interesting light curves. Further investigation of these objects in combination with multiband data will be presented in our forthcoming paper.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493.3825L
Search for Evolutionary Changes in the Period the Cepheid ET Vul;;The reduction of all the available photometry for the Cepheid ET Vul has allowed its $O-C$ diagram spanning a time interval of 130 years to be constructed. This has made it possible to calculate for the first time the rate of evolutionary decrease in the period, $dP/dt=-426.5(±{29.7})$ s yr${}^{-1}$, in agreement with the results of model calculations for the second crossing of the instability strip. The pulsation stability test proposed by Lombard and Koen has confirmed that the evolutionary change in the period is real.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AstL...46..235B
Physical Parameters of Late-type Contact Binaries in the Northern Catalina Sky Survey;;We present the physical parameters of 2335 late-type contact binary (CB) systems extracted from the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS). Our sample was selected from the CSS Data Release 1 by strictly limiting the prevailing temperature uncertainties and light-curve fitting residuals, allowing us to almost eliminate any possible contaminants. We developed an automatic Wilson-Devinney-type code to derive the relative properties of CBs based on their light-curve morphology. By adopting the distances derived from CB (orbital) period-luminosity relations (PLRs), combined with the well-defined mass-luminosity relation for the systems' primary stars and assuming solar metallicity, we calculated the objects' masses, radii, and luminosities. Our sample of fully eclipsing CBs contains 1530 W-, 710 A-, and 95 B-type CBs. A comparison with literature data and with the results from different surveys confirms the accuracy and coherence of our measurements. The period distributions of the various CB subtypes are different, hinting at a possible evolutionary sequence. W-type CBs are clearly located in a strip in the total mass versus mass-ratio plane, while A-type CBs may exhibit a slightly different dependence. There are no significant differences among the PLRs of A- and W-type CBs, but the PLR zero-points are affected by their mass ratios and fill-out factors. Determination of zero-point differences for different types of CBs may help us improve the accuracy of the resulting PLRs. We demonstrate that automated approaches to deriving CB properties could be a powerful tool for application to the much larger CB samples expected to result from future surveys.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJS..247...50S
Necroplanetology: Simulating the Tidal Disruption of Differentiated Planetary Material Orbiting WD 1145+017;;The WD 1145+017 system shows irregular transit features that are consistent with the tidal disruption of differentiated asteroids with bulk densities $ 4\,{\rm{g}}\,{\mathrm{cm}}^{-3}$ and bulk masses $\lesssim {10}^{21}\,\mathrm{kg}$ . We use the open-source N-body code REBOUND to simulate this disruption with different internal structures: varying the core volume fraction, mantle/core density ratio, and the presence/absence of a thin low-density crust. We allow the rubble pile to partially disrupt and capture lightcurves at a specific point during the disruption at cadences comparable to those from ground-based photometry. As a proof-of-concept we show that varying these structural parameters have observationally distinguishable effects on the transit lightcurve as the asteroid is disrupted and compare the simulation-generated lightcurves to data from Gary et al. With the caveat that our simulations do not model the sublimation in detail or account for its effects on orbital evolution, we find that a low core fraction and low mantle/core density ratio asteroid is most consistent with the stable transit feature present for multiple weeks circa 2016 April (referred to as G6121 in Gary et al. and A1 in Hallakoun et al.). Connecting tidal disruption simulations to photometry suggests characteristics for the interior structure and composition of an exoplanetary body, information that is only possible because we are observing the death of the planetary system in action. All-sky survey missions such as TESS and LSST will be able to detect other systems like WD 1145+017, creating a sample of subjects for a new subfield of planetary science: necroplanetology.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893..166D
Constraint on the Ejecta Mass for Black Hole-Neutron Star Merger Event Candidate S190814bv;;We derive the upper limit to the ejecta mass of S190814bv, a black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) merger candidate, through radiative transfer simulations for kilonovae with realistic ejecta density profiles, as well as detailed opacity and heating rate models. The limits to the ejecta mass strongly depend on the viewing angle. For the face-on observations (≤45°), the total ejecta mass should be smaller than 0.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> for the average distance of S190814bv (D = 267 Mpc), while a larger mass is allowed for the edge-on observations. We also derive the conservative upper limits of the dynamical ejecta mass to be 0.02, 0.03, and 0.05 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> for the viewing angles ≤20°, ≤50°, and ≤90°, respectively. We show that an iz-band observation deeper than 22 mag within 2 days after the gravitational-wave trigger is crucial to detect a kilonova with a total ejecta mass of 0.06 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> at a distance of D = 300 Mpc. We also show that a strong constraint on the NS mass-radius relation can be obtained if future observations put an upper limit of 0.03 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> on the dynamical ejecta mass for a BH-NS event with a chirp mass smaller than ≲3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and effective spin larger than ≳0.5.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893..153K
SN 2019ein: New Insights into the Similarities and Diversity among High-velocity Type Ia Supernovae;;We present optical observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN) 2019ein, starting two days after the estimated explosion date. The spectra and light curves show that SN 2019ein belongs to a high-velocity (HV) and broad-line group with a relatively rapid decline in the light curves (Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(B) = 1.36 ± 0.02 mag) and a short rise time (15.37 ± 0.55 days). The Si II λ6355 velocity, associated with a photospheric component but not with a detached high-velocity feature, reached ∼20,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> 12 days before the B-band maximum. The line velocity, however, decreased very rapidly and smoothly toward maximum light, to ∼13,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is relatively low among HV SNe. This indicates that the speed of the spectral evolution of HV SNe Ia is correlated with not only the velocity at maximum light, but also the light-curve decline rate, as is the case for normal-velocity (NV) SNe Ia. Spectral synthesis modeling shows that the outermost layer at >17,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> is well described by an O-Ne-C burning layer extending to at least 25,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, and there is no unburnt carbon below 30,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>; these properties are largely consistent with the delayed detonation scenario and are shared with the prototypical HV SN 2002bo despite the large difference in Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(B). This structure is strikingly different from that derived for the well-studied NV SN 2011fe. We suggest that the relation between the mass of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni (or Δm<SUB>15</SUB>) and the extent of the O-Ne-C burning layer provides an important constraint on the explosion mechanism(s) of HV and NV SNe.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893..143K
The Broad-lined Ic Supernova ZTF18aaqjovh (SN 2018bvw): An Optically Discovered Engine-driven Supernova Candidate with Luminous Radio Emission;;We present ZTF18aaqjovh (SN 2018bvw), a high-velocity ("broad-lined") stripped-envelope (Type Ic) supernova (Ic-BL SN) discovered in the Zwicky Transient Facility one-day cadence survey. ZTF18aaqjovh shares a number of features in common with engine-driven explosions: the photospheric velocity and the shape of the optical light curve are very similar to those of the Type Ic-BL SN 1998bw, which was associated with a low-luminosity gamma-ray burst (LLGRB) and had relativistic ejecta. However, the radio luminosity of ZTF18aaqjovh is almost two orders of magnitude fainter than that of SN 1998bw at the same velocity phase, and the shock velocity is at most mildly relativistic (V = 0.06-0.4c). A search of high-energy catalogs reveals no compelling gamma-ray burst (GRB) counterpart to ZTF18aaqjovh, and the limit on the prompt GRB luminosity of ${L}_{\gamma ,\mathrm{iso}}\approx 1.6\times {10}^{48}\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ excludes a classical GRB but not an LLGRB. Altogether, ZTF18aaqjovh represents another transition event between engine-driven SNe associated with GRBs and "ordinary" Ic-BL SNe.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893..132H
Real-time, Value-driven Data Augmentation in the Era of LSST;;The deluge of data from time-domain surveys is rendering traditional human-guided data collection and inference techniques impractical. We propose a novel approach for conducting data collection for science inference in the era of massive large-scale surveys that uses value-based metrics to autonomously strategize and coordinate follow-up in real time. We demonstrate the underlying principles in the Recommender Engine For Intelligent Transient Tracking (REFITT) that ingests live alerts from surveys and value-added inputs from data brokers to predict the future behavior of transients and design optimal data augmentation strategies given a set of scientific objectives. The prototype presented in this paper is tested to work given simulated Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) core-collapse supernova (CC SN) light curves from the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge data set. CC SNe were selected for the initial development phase as they are known to be difficult to classify, with the expectation that any learning techniques for them should be at least as effective for other transients. We demonstrate the behavior of REFITT on a random LSST night given ∼32,000 live CC SNe of interest. The system makes good predictions for the photometric behavior of the events and uses them to plan follow-up using a simple data-driven metric. We argue that machine-directed follow-up maximizes the scientific potential of surveys and follow-up resources by reducing downtime and bias in data collection.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893..127S
Three-dimensional Simulations of Magnetar-powered Superluminous Supernovae;;A rapidly spinning magnetar in a young supernova (SN) can produce a superluminous transient by converting a fraction of its rotational energy into radiation. Here, we present the first three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations ever performed of a magnetar-powered SN in the circumstellar medium formed by the ejection of the outer layers of the star prior to the blast. We find that hydrodynamical instabilities form on two scales in the ejecta, not just one as in ordinary core-collapse SNe: in the hot bubble energized by the magnetar and in the forward shock of the SN as it plows up ambient gas. Pressure from the bubble also makes the instabilities behind the forward shock more violent and causes more mixing in the explosion than in normal SNe, with important consequences for the light curves and spectra of the event that cannot be captured by one-dimensional models. We also find that the magnetar can accelerate Ca and Si to velocities of ∼12,000 $\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ and account for their broadened emission lines in observations. Our simulations also reveal that energy from even weak magnetars can accelerate iron-group elements deep in the ejecta to 5000-7000 $\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ and explain the high-velocity Fe observed at early times in some core-collapse SNe such as SN 1987A.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893...99C
Variability of Massive Stars in M31 from the Palomar Transient Factory;;Using data from the (intermediate) Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF), we characterize the time variability of ≈500 massive stars in M31. Our sample is those stars that are spectrally typed by Massey and collaborators, including Luminous Blue Variables, Wolf-Rayets, and warm and cool supergiants. We use the high-cadence, long-baseline (≈5 yr) data from the iPTF survey, coupled with data-processing tools that model complex features in the light curves. We find widespread photometric (R-band) variability in the upper Hertzsprung Russell diagram (or CMD) with an increasing prevalence of variability with later spectral types. Red stars (V - I > 1.5) exhibit larger amplitude fluctuations than their bluer counterparts. We extract a characteristic variability timescale, t<SUB>ch</SUB>, via wavelet transformations that are sensitive to both continuous and localized fluctuations. Cool supergiants are characterized by longer timescales (>100 days) than the hotter stars. The latter have typical timescales of tens of days but cover a wider range, from our resolution limit of a few days to longer than 100 days. Using a 60 night block of data straddling two nights with a cadence of around 2 minutes, we extracted t<SUB>ch</SUB> in the range 0.1-10 days with amplitudes of a few percent for 13 stars. Though there is broad agreement between the observed variability characteristics in the different parts of the upper CMD with theoretical predictions, detailed comparison requires models with a more comprehensive treatment of the various physical processes operating in these stars, such as pulsation, subsurface convection, and the effect of binary companions.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893...11S
Gravitational-wave Radiation of Double Degenerates with Extremely Low-mass White Dwarf Companions;;Double degenerate (DD) systems are supposed to be significant gravitational-wave (GW) sources for future space-based GW detectors, e.g., the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Recently, one type of DD system with extremely low-mass WD (ELM WD; ≲ 0.30 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) companions was found in the ELM Survey. These companions have very short orbital periods and are therefore important sources for LISA detection. Further, due to the thick envelope of ELM WDs compared with massive WDs (e.g., CO WDs), they are much easier to find through the combination of electromagnetic (EM) and GW observations. In this paper, we first obtain the population of ELM WDs in DDs by considering the detailed evolutionary tracks of ELM WDs and then analyzing the GW radiation of these systems. We found that about 6 × 10<SUP>3</SUP> sources could be solely detected by LISA, including ∼2 × 10<SUP>3</SUP> chirping sources, and ∼13 (∼107) more sources are expected to be detected by both LISA and the ELM Survey (Gaia).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...893....2L
The Low Earth Orbit Satellite Population and Impacts of the SpaceX Starlink Constellation;;I discuss the current low Earth orbit artificial satellite population and show that the proposed "megaconstellation" of circa 12,000 Starlink Internet satellites would dominate the lower part of the Earth orbit, below 600 km, with a latitude-dependent areal number density of between 0.005 and 0.01 objects per square degree at airmass <2. Such large, low-altitude satellites appear visually bright to ground observers, and the initial Starlinks are naked-eye objects. I model the expected number of illuminated satellites as a function of latitude, time of year, and time of night and summarize the range of possible consequences for ground-based astronomy. In winter at lower latitudes typical of major observatories, the satellites will not be illuminated for six hours in the middle of the night. However, at low elevations near twilight at intermediate latitudes (45°-55°, e.g., much of Europe) hundreds of satellites may be visible at once to naked-eye observers at dark sites.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892L..36M
A 1201 s Orbital Period Detached Binary: The First Double Helium Core White Dwarf LISA Verification Binary;;We report the discovery of a 1201 s orbital period binary, the third shortest-period detached binary known. Sloan Digital Sky Survey J232230.20 + 050942.06 contains two He-core white dwarfs orbiting with a 27° inclination. Located 0.76 kpc from the Sun, the binary has an estimated Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) 4 yr signal-to-noise ratio of 40. J2322 + 0509 is the first He + He white dwarf LISA verification binary, a source class that is predicted to account for one-third of resolved LISA ultra-compact binary detections.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892L..35B
LAMOST J040643.69+542347.8: The Fastest Rotator in the Galaxy;;Rotation and binary interaction play important roles in understanding the nature of massive stars (≳8M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). Some interesting transients, such as the long-duration gamma-ray bursts, are thought to be originated from fast-rotating massive stars. Because the strong stellar wind can effectively spin down a metal-rich massive star with fast rotation, it is very hard to find single massive stars rotating critically in the Galaxy. In the present work reported is the discovery of the fastest rotator in the Galaxy, LAMOST J040643.69+542347.8, with a projected rotational velocity V<SUB>e</SUB> sin I ∼ 540 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is ∼100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> faster than that of the previous record holder HD 191423. The star has a spectral type of O6.5 Vnnn(f)p. Its He I λ4471 absorption line is blueshifted and asymmetric, while its He II λ4686 and Hα have central absorption reversals in their emissions. It is also a runaway star, which implies an origin in a close binary interaction. Compared to VFTS 285 and VFTS 102 (their V<SUB>e</SUB> sin I ∼ 610 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) in the Large Magellanic Cloud, LAMOST J040643.69+542347.8 has its own peculiar spectral characteristics and earlier spectral type. Moreover, LAMOST J040643.69+542347.8 is bright (B ∼ 13.9 mag) enough to allow future high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892L..26L
The Lowest of the Low: Discovery of SN 2019gsc and the Nature of Faint Iax Supernovae;;We present the discovery and optical follow-up of the faintest supernova-like transient known. The event (SN 2019gsc) was discovered in a star-forming host at 53 Mpc by ATLAS. A detailed multicolor light curve was gathered with Pan-STARRS1 and follow-up spectroscopy was obtained with the Nordic Optical Telescope and Gemini-North. The spectra near maximum light show narrow features at low velocities of 3000-4000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, similar to the extremely low-luminosity SNe 2010ae and 2008ha, and the light curve displays a similar fast decline (Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(r) = 0.91 ± 0.10 mag). SNe 2010ae and 2008ha have been classified as SNe Iax, and together the three either make up a distinct physical class of their own or are at the extreme low-luminosity end of this diverse supernova population. The bolometric light curve is consistent with a low kinetic energy of explosion (E<SUB>k</SUB> ∼ 10<SUP>49</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>), a modest ejected mass (M<SUB>ej</SUB> ∼ 0.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), and radioactive powering by <SUP>56</SUP>Ni (M<SUB>Ni</SUB> ∼ 2 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). The spectra are quite well reproduced with radiative transfer models (TARDIS) and a composition dominated by carbon, oxygen, magnesium, silicon, and sulfur. Remarkably, all three of these extreme Iax events are in similar low-metallicity star-forming environments. The combination of the observational constraints for all three may be best explained by deflagrations of near M<SUB>Ch</SUB> hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon white dwarfs that have short evolutionary pathways to formation.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892L..24S
Host Galaxies of Type Ic and Broad-lined Type Ic Supernovae from the Palomar Transient Factory: Implications for Jet Production;;Unlike ordinary supernovae (SNe), some of which are hydrogen and helium deficient (called Type Ic SNe), broad-lined Type Ic SNe (SNe Ic-bl) are very energetic events, and only SNe Ic-bl are coincident with long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Understanding the progenitors of SN Ic-bl explosions versus those of their SN Ic cousins is key to understanding the SN-GRB relationship and jet production in massive stars. Here we present the largest existing set of host galaxy spectra of 28 SNe Ic and 14 SNe Ic-bl, all discovered by the same galaxy-untargeted survey, namely, the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). We carefully measure their gas-phase metallicities, stellar masses (M<SUB>*</SUB>), and star formation rates (SFRs). We further reanalyze the hosts of 10 literature SN-GRBs using the same methods and compare them to our PTF SN hosts with the goal of constraining their progenitors from their local environments. We find that the metallicities, SFRs, and M<SUB>*</SUB> values of our PTF SN Ic-bl hosts are statistically comparable to those of SN-GRBs but significantly lower than those of the PTF SNe Ic. The mass-metallicity relations as defined by the SNe Ic-bl and SN-GRBs are not significantly different from the same relations as defined by Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies, contradicting claims by earlier works. Our findings point toward low metallicity as a crucial ingredient for SN Ic-bl and SN-GRB production since we are able to break the degeneracy between high SFR and low metallicity. We suggest that the PTF SNe Ic-bl may have produced jets that were choked inside the star or were able to break out of the star as unseen low-luminosity or off-axis GRBs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892..153M
SN 2017cfd: A Normal Type Ia Supernova Discovered Very Young;;The Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2017cfd in IC 0511 (redshift z=0.01209 ± 0.00016) was discovered by the Lick Observatory Supernova Search 1.6 ± 0.7 day after the fitted first-light time (15.2 days before B-band maximum brightness). Photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations show that SN 2017cfd is a typical, normal SN Ia with a peak luminosity M<SUB>B</SUB> ≈ -19.2± 0.2 mag, Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(B) = 1.16 mag, and reached a B-band maximum ∼16.8 days after the first light. We estimate there to be moderately strong host-galaxy extinction (A<SUB>V</SUB> = 0.39 ± 0.03 mag) based on MLCS2k2 fitting. The spectrum reveals a Si II λ6355 velocity of ∼11,200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> at peak brightness. SN 2017cfd was discovered very young, with multiband data taken starting 2 days after the first light, making it a valuable complement to the currently small sample (fewer than a dozen) of SNe Ia with color data at such early times. We find that its intrinsic early-time (B-V)<SUB>0</SUB> color evolution belongs to the "blue" population rather than to the distinct "red" population. Using the photometry, we constrain the companion-star radius to be ≲2.5 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> with the Kasen model, thus ruling out a red-giant companion.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892..142H
A Classification Algorithm for Time-domain Novelties in Preparation for LSST Alerts. Application to Variable Stars and Transients Detected with DECam in the Galactic Bulge;;With the advent of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, time-domain astronomy will be faced with an unprecedented volume and rate of data. Real-time processing of variables and transients detected by such large-scale surveys is critical to identifying the more unusual events and allocating scarce follow-up resources efficiently. We develop an algorithm to identify these novel events within a given population of variable sources. We determine the distributions of magnitude changes (dm) over time intervals (dt) for a given passband f, p<SUB>f</SUB>({dm}| {dt}), and use these distributions to compute the likelihood of a test source being consistent with the population or being an outlier. We demonstrate our algorithm by applying it to the DECam multiband time-series data of more than 2000 variable stars identified by Saha et al. in the Galactic Bulge that are largely dominated by long-period variables and pulsating stars. Our algorithm discovers 18 outlier sources in the sample, including a microlensing event, a dwarf nova, and two chromospherically active RS CVn stars, as well as sources in the blue horizontal branch region of the color-magnitude diagram without any known counterparts. We compare the performance of our algorithm for novelty detection with the multivariate Kernel Density Estimator and Isolation Forest on the simulated PLAsTiCC data set. We find that our algorithm yields comparable results despite its simplicity. Our method provides an efficient way for flagging the most unusual events in a real-time alert-broker system.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892..112S
BVI<SUB>c</SUB> Observations and Search for Evolutionary Variations in the Cepheid V811 Oph Period;;For the first time, BVI<SUB>c</SUB> observations of the Cepheid V811 Oph were obtained by using a new 60-cm telescope at the Caucasus Mountain Observatory, Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Moscow State University (SAI MSU). An diagram covering a time span of 124 years was plotted using photometry from old photographic and modern sky surveys. The diagram has a parabola shape, which made it possible to determine for the first time the quadratic elements of the brightness variations. Furthermore, it made it possible to calculate the rate of an evolutionary decrease in the period of V811 Oph s/year, which is consistent with the theoretical calculation results for the second intersection of the instability strip if this Cepheid is a classical one. The pulsation stability test proposed by Lombard and Koen confirmed the actual decrease in the period.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ARep...64..310B
SUGAR: An improved empirical model of Type Ia supernovae based on spectral features;;Context. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are widely used to measure the expansion of the Universe. Improving distance measurements of SNe Ia is one technique to better constrain the acceleration of expansion and determine its physical nature. 
 Aims: This document develops a new SNe Ia spectral energy distribution (SED) model, called the SUpernova Generator And Reconstructor (SUGAR), which improves the spectral description of SNe Ia, and consequently could improve the distance measurements. 
 Methods: This model was constructed from SNe Ia spectral properties and spectrophotometric data from the Nearby Supernova Factory collaboration. In a first step, a principal component analysis-like method was used on spectral features measured at maximum light, which allowed us to extract the intrinsic properties of SNe Ia. Next, the intrinsic properties were used to extract the average extinction curve. Third, an interpolation using Gaussian processes facilitated using data taken at different epochs during the lifetime of an SN Ia and then projecting the data on a fixed time grid. Finally, the three steps were combined to build the SED model as a function of time and wavelength. This is the SUGAR model. 
 Results: The main advancement in SUGAR is the addition of two additional parameters to characterize SNe Ia variability. The first is tied to the properties of SNe Ia ejecta velocity and the second correlates with their calcium lines. The addition of these parameters, as well as the high quality of the Nearby Supernova Factory data, makes SUGAR an accurate and efficient model for describing the spectra of normal SNe Ia as they brighten and fade. 
 Conclusions: The performance of this model makes it an excellent SED model for experiments like the Zwicky Transient Facility, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, or the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope.

Rates of Stellar Tidal Disruption;;Tidal disruption events occur rarely in any individual galaxy. Over the last decade, however, time-domain surveys have begun to accumulate statistical samples of these flares. What dynamical processes are responsible for feeding stars to supermassive black holes? At what rate are stars tidally disrupted in realistic galactic nuclei? What may we learn about supermassive black holes and broader astrophysical questions by estimating tidal disruption event rates from observational samples of flares? These are the questions we aim to address in this Chapter, which summarizes current theoretical knowledge about rates of stellar tidal disruption, and compares theoretical predictions to the current state of observations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020SSRv..216...35S
The Host Galaxies of Tidal Disruption Events;;Recent studies of Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) have revealed unexpected correlations between the TDE rate and the large-scale properties of the host galaxies. In this review, we present the host galaxy properties of all TDE candidates known to date and quantify their distributions. We consider throughout the differences between observationally-identified types of TDEs and differences from spectroscopic control samples of galaxies. We focus here on the black hole and stellar masses of TDE host galaxies, their star formation histories and stellar populations, the concentration and morphology of the optical light, the presence of AGN activity, and the extra-galactic environment of the TDE hosts. We summarize the state of several possible explanations for the links between the TDE rate and host galaxy type. We present estimates of the TDE rate for different host galaxy types and quantify the degree to which rate enhancement in some types results in rate suppression in others. We discuss the possibilities for using TDE host galaxies to assist in identifying TDEs in upcoming large transient surveys and possibilities for TDE observations to be used to study their host galaxies.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020SSRv..216...32F
Mechanism of High-Efficiency Electron Beam Generation in a High-Voltage Discharge in Helium and Its Mixtures with Oxygen and Nitrogen;;The results of investigation of the current-voltage characteristics (CVCs) and electron beam generation efficiency in continuous discharges in helium, its mixtures with oxygen and nitrogen, as well as in pure oxygen and helium are presented. Peculiarities of CVCs are singled out and interpreted in terms of a changed role of the principal emission mechanisms with an increase in the voltage. It is shown that a high efficiency of the electron beam generation of more than 80% can be achieved in glow discharges in helium, oxygen, and nitrogen. In helium, it is provided by the predominating photoemission, while in oxygen and nitrogen and their mixtures with helium - mainly by the kinetic emission under the impact of fast heavy particles.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020RuPhJ..62.1989B
The Zwicky Transient Facility: Observing System;;The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Observing System (OS) is the data collector for the ZTF project to study astrophysical phenomena in the time domain. ZTF OS is based upon the 48 inch aperture Schmidt-type design Samuel Oschin Telescope at the Palomar Observatory in Southern California. It incorporates new telescope aspheric corrector optics, dome and telescope drives, a large-format exposure shutter, a flat-field illumination system, a robotic bandpass filter exchanger, and the key element: a new 47-square-degree, 600 megapixel cryogenic CCD mosaic science camera, along with supporting equipment. The OS collects and delivers digitized survey data to the ZTF Data System (DS). Here, we describe the ZTF OS design, optical implementation, delivered image quality, detector performance, and robotic survey efficiency.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132c8001D
The Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). Science Case and Survey Design;;The Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) is a synoptic, all-sky radio sky survey with a unique combination of high angular resolution (≈2"5), sensitivity (a 1σ goal of 70 μJy/beam in the coadded data), full linear Stokes polarimetry, time domain coverage, and wide bandwidth (2-4 GHz). The first observations began in 2017 September, and observing for the survey will finish in 2024. VLASS will use approximately 5500 hr of time on the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to cover the whole sky visible to the VLA (decl. > -40°), a total of 33 885 deg 2 . The data will be taken in three epochs to allow the discovery of variable and transient radio sources. The survey is designed to engage radio astronomy experts, multi-wavelength astronomers, and citizen scientists alike. By utilizing an "on the fly" interferometry mode, the observing overheads are much reduced compared to a conventional pointed survey. In this paper, we present the science case and observational strategy for the survey, and also results from early survey observations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132c5001L
Constraining planet formation around 6-8 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> stars;;Identifying planets around O-type and B-type stars is inherently difficult; the most massive known planet host has a mass of only about $3\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$ . However, planetary systems which survive the transformation of their host stars into white dwarfs can be detected via photospheric trace metals, circumstellar dusty and gaseous discs, and transits of planetary debris crossing our line of sight. These signatures offer the potential to explore the efficiency of planet formation for host stars with masses up to the core-collapse boundary at $\approx 8\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$ , a mass regime rarely investigated in planet formation theory. Here, we establish limits on where both major and minor planets must reside around $\approx 6\rm {-}8\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$ stars in order to survive into the white dwarf phase. For this mass range, we find that intact terrestrial or giant planets need to leave the main sequence beyond approximate minimum star-planet separations of, respectively, about 3 and 6 au. In these systems, rubble pile minor planets of radii 10, 1.0, and 0.1 km would have been shorn apart by giant branch radiative YORP spin-up if they formed and remained within, respectively, tens, hundreds, and thousands of au. These boundary values would help distinguish the nature of the progenitor of metal pollution in white dwarf atmospheres. We find that planet formation around the highest mass white dwarf progenitors may be feasible, and hence encourage both dedicated planet formation investigations for these systems and spectroscopic analyses of the highest mass white dwarfs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493..765V
Tidal disruption of planetary bodies by white dwarfs - II. Debris disc structure and ejected interstellar asteroids;;We make use of a new hybrid method to simulate the long-term, multiple-orbit disc formation through tidal disruptions of rocky bodies by white dwarfs, at high-resolution and realistic semimajor axis. We perform the largest yet suite of simulations for dwarf and terrestrial planets, spanning four orders of magnitude in mass, various pericentre distances, and semimajor axes between 3 and 150 au. This large phase space of tidal disruption conditions has not been accessible through the use of previous codes. We analyse the statistical and structural properties of the emerging debris discs, as well as the ejected unbound debris contributing to the population of interstellar asteroids. Unlike previous tidal disruption studies of small asteroids which form ring-like structures on the original orbit, we find that the tidal disruption of larger bodies usually forms dispersed structures of interlaced elliptic eccentric annuli on tighter orbits. We characterize the (typically power law) size distribution of the ejected interstellar bodies as well as their composition, rotation velocities, and ejection velocities. We find them to be sensitive to the depth (impact parameter) of the tidal disruption. Finally, we briefly discuss possible implications of our results in explaining the peculiar variability of Tabby's star, the origin of the transit events of ZTF J0139+5245 and the formation of a planetary core around SDSS J1228+1040.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493..698M
Limits on the electromagnetic counterpart to S190814bv;;We derive limits on any electromagnetic counterpart to the compact binary merger S190814bv, whose parameters are consistent with the merger of a black hole and a neutron star. We present observations with the new wide-field optical imager DDOTI and also consider Swift/BAT observations reported by Palmer et al. We show that Swift/BAT would have detected a counterpart with similar properties to a typical on-axis short GRB at the 98 per cent confidence level, whereas our DDOTI observations only rule out such a counterpart at the 27 per cent confidence level. Neither has sufficient sensitivity to rule out an off-axis counterpart like GW 170817. We compare the efficiency of Swift/BAT and DDOTI for future observations, and show that DDOTI is likely to be about twice as efficient as Swift/BAT for off-axis events up to about 100 Mpc.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.5916W
Constraining the origin of the planetary debris surrounding ZTF J0139+5245 through rotational fission of a triaxial asteroid;;White dwarfs containing orbiting planetesimals or their debris represent crucial benchmarks by which theoretical investigations of post-main-sequence planetary systems may be calibrated. The photometric transit signatures of likely planetary debris in the ZTF J0139+5245 white dwarf system have an orbital period of about 110 d. An asteroid which breaks up to produce this debris may spin itself to destruction through repeated close encounters with the star without entering its Roche radius and without influence from the white dwarf's luminosity. Here, we place coupled constraints on the orbital pericentre (q) and the ratio (β) of the middle to longest semiaxes of a triaxial asteroid which disrupts outside of this white dwarf's Roche radius (r<SUB>Roche</SUB>) soon after attaining its 110-d orbit. We find that disruption within tens of years is likely when β ≲ 0.6 and q ≈ 1.0-2.0r<SUB>Roche</SUB>, and when β ≲ 0.2 out to q ≈ 2.5r<SUB>Roche</SUB>. Analysing the longer time-scale disruption of triaxial asteroids around ZTF J0139+5245 is desirable but may require either an analytical approach relying on ergodic theory or novel numerical techniques.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.5291V
The first six months of the Advanced LIGO's and Advanced Virgo's third observing run with GRANDMA;;We present the Global Rapid Advanced Network Devoted to the Multi-messenger Addicts (GRANDMA). The network consists of 21 telescopes with both photometric and spectroscopic facilities. They are connected together thanks to a dedicated infrastructure. The network aims at coordinating the observations of large sky position estimates of transient events to enhance their follow-up and reduce the delay between the initial detection and optical confirmation. The GRANDMA programme mainly focuses on follow-up of gravitational-wave alerts to find and characterize the electromagnetic counterpart during the third observational campaign of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. But it allows for follow-up of any transient alerts involving neutrinos or gamma-ray bursts, even those with poor spatial localization. We present the different facilities, tools, and methods we developed for this network and show its efficiency using observations of LIGO/Virgo S190425z, a binary neutron star merger candidate. We furthermore report on all GRANDMA follow-up observations performed during the first six months of the LIGO-Virgo observational campaign, and we derive constraints on the kilonova properties assuming that the events' locations were imaged by our telescopes.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.3904A
Luminous Red Novae: population models and future prospects;;A class of optical transients known as Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) have recently been associated with mass ejections from binary stars undergoing common-envelope evolution. We use the population synthesis code COMPAS to explore the impact of a range of assumptions about the physics of common-envelope evolution on the properties of LRNe. In particular, we investigate the influence of various models for the energetics of LRNe on the expected event rate and light curve characteristics, and compare with the existing sample. We find that the Galactic rate of LRNe is ∼0.2 yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, in agreement with the observed rate. In our models, the luminosity function of Galactic LRNe covers multiple decades in luminosity and is dominated by signals from stellar mergers, consistent with observational constraints from iPTF and the Galactic sample of LRNe. We discuss how observations of the brightest LRNe may provide indirect evidence for the existence of massive (>40 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) red supergiants. Such LRNe could be markers along the evolutionary pathway leading to the formation of double compact objects. We make predictions for the population of LRNe observable in future transient surveys with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the Zwicky Transient Facility. In all plausible circumstances, we predict a selection-limited observable population dominated by bright, long-duration events caused by common envelope ejections. We show that the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will observe 20-750 LRNe per year, quickly constraining the luminosity function of LRNe and probing the physics of common-envelope events.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.3229H
The brave new world of eclipsing binary modeling;;This contribution highlights some of the open questions identified by the binary star community in attendance, based on a 45-min discussion in lieu of an ex-cathedra talk. As photometric and spectroscopic data accuracy reach unprecedented levels, it is crucial to identify and address these open questions. In what follows are concise minutes from the discussion with minimal commentary, in an effort to stimulate further discussion and promote focused studies dedicating to answering these open questions.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020CoSka..50..565P
The explosive life of massive binaries;;Massive stars are born predominantly as members of binary (or higher multiplicity) systems, and the presence of a companion can significantly alter their life and final fate. Therefore, any observed sample of massive stars or associated transients is likely to be significantly influenced by the effects of binarity. Here, we focus on the relationship between massive binary evolution and core-collapse supernova events. In the vast majority of the cases, the first core-collapse event happening in a binary system unbinds the two stars. Studying the population of companion stars, either at the supernova site, or as ``widowed'' stars long after the explosion, can be used to constrain the previous orbital evolution of the binary progenitor, and explosion physics of their former companion. Specifically, the population of ``widowed'' stars might provide statistical constraints on the typical amplitude of black hole natal kicks without seeing neither the black holes nor the transient possibly associated to their formation. Binarity also has a large impact on the predicted population of supernova sub-types, including hydrogen-rich type II supernovae, with a significant fraction of hydrogen-rich stars at explosions being either merger products or accretors.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020CoSka..50..472R
\boldsymbol{BVI}_{\boldsymbol{c}}\boldsymbol{g('r^'i^') Observations and Search for Evolutionary Changes in the Period of the Cepheid V1467 Cyg;;$BVI<SUB>c</SUB>g^'r^'i^'$ observations of the classical Cepheid V1467 Cyg have been obtained with the 60-cm telescope at the Caucasus Mountain Observatory of the SAI MSU. Invoking all of the available photometry has allowed an $O-C$ diagram spanning a time interval of 107 years to be constructed. This has made it possible to calculate for the first time the rate of evolutionary decrease in the period of V1467 Cyg, $dP/dt={-}431.5({±}{8.2})$ s yr${}^{-1}$, in agreement with the results of model calculations for the second crossing of the instability strip. The pulsation stability test proposed by Lombard and Koen has confirmed that the evolutionary changes in the period are real.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AstL...46..156B
Optical Polarimetry of the Tidal Disruption Event AT2019DSG;;We present time-series imaging polarimetry observations of a nearby tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2019DSG at z = 0.0512 to probe the disruption mechanism and shed light on the accretion process. We obtain linear polarimetry using the Alhambra Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera on board the 2.5 m Nordic Optical Telescope. Our observations showed a polarization at the 9.2% ± 2.7% level early on, decreasing to less than 2.7% (at the 68% confidence level) one month later. While the high level of polarization in the early epoch is similar to that of Swift J164449.3+573451 and Swift J2058+0516, the low level of polarization in the later epoch is in agreement with that of OGLE16aaa. Our results thus show the temporal evolution of optical polarization from a TDE. As the degree of polarization changes over time, it is unlikely to be attributed to host galaxy dust, but may originate from a non-isotropic accreting disk, or associated with the relativistic jet emission.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892L...1L
SN 2010kd: Photometric and Spectroscopic Analysis of a Slow-decaying Superluminous Supernova;;This paper presents data and analysis of SN 2010kd, a low-redshift (z = 0.101) H-deficient superluminous supernova (SLSN), based on ultraviolet/optical photometry and optical spectroscopy spanning between -28 and +194 days relative to B-band maximum light. The B-band light-curve comparison of SN 2010kd with a subset of well-studied SLSNe I at comparable redshifts indicates that it is a slow-decaying PTF12dam-like SLSN. Analytical light-curve modeling using the Minim code suggests that the bolometric light curve of SN 2010kd favors circumstellar matter interaction for the powering mechanism. SYNAPPS modeling of the early-phase spectra does not identify broad H or He lines, whereas the photospheric-phase spectra are dominated by O I, O II, C II, C IV, and Si II, in particular the presence of both low- and high-velocity components of O II and Si II lines. The nebular-phase spectra of SN 2010kd are dominated by O I and Ca II emission lines similar to those seen in other SLSNe I. The line velocities in SN 2010kd exhibit flatter evolution curves similar to SN 2015bn but with comparatively higher values. SN 2010kd shows a higher single-zone local thermodynamic equilibrium temperature in comparison to PTF12dam and SN 2015bn, and it has an upper O I ejected mass limit of ∼10 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The host of SN 2010kd is a dwarf galaxy with a high star formation rate (∼0.18 ± 0.04 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) and extreme emission lines.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892...28K
The HSC-SSP Transient Survey: Implications from Early Photometry and Rise Time of Normal Type Ia Supernovae;;With a booming number of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered within a few days of their explosions, a fraction of SNe Ia that show luminosity excess in the early phase (early-excess SNe Ia) have been confirmed. In this article, we report early-phase observations of seven photometrically normal SNe Ia (six early detections and one deep non detection limit) at the COSMOS field through a half-year transient survey as a part of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC SSP). In particular, a blue light-curve excess was discovered for HSC17bmhk, a normal SN Ia with rise time longer than 18.8 days, during the first four days after the discovery. The blue early excess in optical wavelength can be explained not only by interactions with a nondegenerate companion or surrounding dense circumstellar matter but also radiation powered by radioactive decays of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni at the surface of the SN ejecta. Given the growing evidence of the early-excess discoveries in normal SNe Ia that have longer rise times than the average, and a similarity in the nature of the blue excess to a luminous SN Ia subclass, we infer that early excess discovered in HSC17bmhk and other normal SNe Ia are most likely attributed to radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni decay at the surface of the SN ejecta. In order to successfully identify normal SNe Ia with early excess similar to that of HSC17bmhk, early UV photometries or high-cadence blue-band surveys are necessary.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...892...25J
The First Ultracompact Roche Lobe-Filling Hot Subdwarf Binary;;We report the discovery of the first short-period binary in which a hot subdwarf star (sdOB) filled its Roche lobe and started mass transfer to its companion. The object was discovered as part of a dedicated high-cadence survey of the Galactic plane named the Zwicky Transient Facility and exhibits a period of P = 39.3401(1) minutes, making it the most compact hot subdwarf binary currently known. Spectroscopic observations are consistent with an intermediate He-sdOB star with an effective temperature of T_{eff} = 42,400 ± 300 K and a surface gravity of log (g) = 5.77 ± 0.05. A high signal-to-noise ratio GTC+HiPERCAM light curve is dominated by the ellipsoidal deformation of the sdOB star and an eclipse of the sdOB by an accretion disk. We infer a low-mass hot subdwarf donor with a mass M<SUB>sdOB</SUB> = 0.337 ± 0.015 M_{⊙} and a white dwarf accretor with a mass M<SUB>WD</SUB> = 0.545 ± 0.020 M_{⊙}. Theoretical binary modeling indicates the hot subdwarf formed during a common envelope phase when a 2.5-2.8 M_{⊙} star lost its envelope when crossing the Hertzsprung gap. To match its current P_{orb}, T_{eff}, log (g), and masses, we estimate a post-common envelope period of P_{orb} ≈ 150 minutes and find that the sdOB star is currently undergoing hydrogen shell burning. We estimate that the hot subdwarf will become a white dwarf with a thick helium layer of ≈0.1 M_{⊙}, merge with its carbon/oxygen white dwarf companion after ≈17 Myr, and presumably explode as a thermonuclear supernova or form an R CrB star.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...891...45K
The rise and fall of an extraordinary Ca-rich transient. The discovery of ATLAS19dqr/SN 2019bkc;;This work presents the observations and analysis of ATLAS19dqr/SN 2019bkc, an extraordinary rapidly evolving transient event located in an isolated environment, tens of kiloparsecs from any likely host. Its light curves rise to maximum light in 5-6 d and then display a decline of Δm<SUB>15</SUB> ∼ 5 mag. With such a pronounced decay, it has one of the most rapidly evolving light curves known for a stellar explosion. The early spectra show similarities to normal and "ultra-stripped" type Ic SNe, but the early nebular phase spectra, which were reached just over two weeks after explosion, display prominent calcium lines, marking SN 2019bkc as a Ca-rich transient. The Ca emission lines at this phase show an unprecedented and unexplained blueshift of 10 000-12 000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Modelling of the light curve and the early spectra suggests that the transient had a low ejecta mass of 0.2-0.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a low kinetic energy of (2-4) × 10<SUP>50</SUP> erg, giving a specific kinetic energy E<SUB>k</SUB>/M<SUB>ej</SUB> ∼ 1 [10<SUP>51</SUP> erg]/M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The origin of this event cannot be unambiguously defined. While the abundance distribution used to model the spectra marginally favours a progenitor of white dwarf origin through the tentative identification of Ar II, the specific kinetic energy, which is defined by the explosion mechanism, is found to be more similar to an ultra-stripped core-collapse events. SN 2019bkc adds to the diverse range of physical properties shown by Ca-rich events.

Palomar Gattini-IR: Survey Overview, Data Processing System, On-sky Performance and First Results;;Palomar Gattini-IR is a new wide-field, near-infrared (NIR) robotic time domain survey operating at Palomar Observatory. Using a 30 cm telescope mounted with a H2RG detector, Gattini-IR achieves a field of view (FOV) of 25 sq. deg. with a pixel scale of 8.″7 in J-band. Here, we describe the system design, survey operations, data processing system and on-sky performance of Palomar Gattini-IR. As a part of the nominal survey, Gattini-IR scans ≈7500 square degrees of the sky every night to a median 5σ depth of 15.7 AB mag outside the Galactic plane. The survey covers ≈15,000 square degrees of the sky visible from Palomar with a median cadence of 2 days. A real-time data processing system produces stacked science images from dithered raw images taken on sky, together with point-spread function (PSF)-fit source catalogs and transient candidates identified from subtractions within a median delay of ≈4 hr from the time of observation. The calibrated data products achieve an astrometric accuracy (rms) of ≈0.″7 with respect to Gaia DR2 for sources with signal-to-noise ratio > 10, and better than ≈0.″35 for sources brighter than ≈12 Vega mag. The photometric accuracy (rms) achieved in the PSF-fit source catalogs is better than ≈3% for sources brighter than ≈12 Vega mag and fainter than the saturation magnitude of ≈8.5 Vega mag, as calibrated against the Two Micron All Sky Survey catalog. The detection efficiency of transient candidates injected into the images is better than 90% for sources brighter than the 5σ limiting magnitude. The photometric recovery precision of injected sources is 3% for sources brighter than 13 mag, and the astrometric recovery rms is ≈0.″9. Reference images generated by stacking several field visits achieve depths of ≳16.5 AB mag over 60% of the sky, while it is limited by confusion in the Galactic plane. With a FOV ≈40× larger than any other existing NIR imaging instrument, Gattini-IR is probing the reddest and dustiest transients in the local universe such as dust obscured supernovae in nearby galaxies, novae behind large columns of extinction within the galaxy, reddened microlensing events in the Galactic plane and variability from cool and dust obscured stars. We present results from transients and variables identified since the start of the commissioning period.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PASP..132b5001D
Orbital Dynamics of 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB>: the First Vatira Asteroid;;Vatira-class near-Earth objects (NEOs) have orbits entirely interior to the orbit of Venus with aphelia 0.307 < Q < 0.718 AU. Recently discovered asteroid 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB> by the Zwicky Transient Facility on 4 January 2020 is the first known object on a Vatira orbit. Numerical integrations of 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB>'s nominal orbit show it remaining in the Vatira region for the next few hundred kyr before coupling to Venus and evolving onto an Atira orbit (NEOs entirely interior to Earth's orbit with 0.718 < Q < 0.983 AU) and eventually scattering out to Earth-crossing. The numerical integrations of 9900 clones within 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB>'s orbital uncertainty region show examples of Vatira orbits trapped in the 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Venus at semimajor axis a ≈ 0.552 AU that can survive on the order of a few Myr. Possible 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB> orbits also include those on Vatira orbits between Mercury and Venus that only rarely cross that of a planet. Together the 3:2 resonance and these rarely-planet-crossing orbits provide a meta-stable region of phase space that are stable on timescales of several Myr. If 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB> is currently in this meta-stable region (or was in the past), that may explain its discovery as the first Vatira and may be where more are discovered.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493L.129G
Missing red supergiants and carbon burning;;Recent studies on direct imaging of Type II core-collapse supernova progenitors indicate a possible threshold around M<SUB>ZAMS</SUB> ∼ 16-20 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, where red supergiants (RSG) with larger birth masses do not appear to result in supernova explosions and instead implode directly into a black hole. In this study, we argue that it is not a coincidence that this threshold closely matches the critical transition of central carbon burning in massive stars from the convective to radiative regime. In lighter stars, carbon burns convectively in the centre and result in compact final pre-supernova cores that are likely to result in explosions, while in heavier stars after the transition, it burns as a radiative flame and the stellar cores become significantly harder to explode. Using the kepler code we demonstrate the sensitivity of this transition to the rate of <SUP>12</SUP>C(α, γ)<SUP>16</SUP>O reaction and the overshoot mixing efficiency, and we argue that the upper mass limit of exploding RSG could be employed to constrain uncertain input physics of massive stellar evolution calculations. The initial mass corresponding to the central carbon burning transition range from 14 to 26 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> in recently published models from various groups and codes, and only a few are in agreement with the estimates inferred from direct imaging studies.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.2578S
Post-main-sequence debris from rotation-induced YORP break-up of small bodies - II. Multiple fissions, internal strengths, and binary production;;Over one-quarter of white dwarfs contain observable metallic debris from the break-up of exo-asteroids. Understanding the physical and orbital history of this debris would enable us to self-consistently link planetary system formation and fate. One major debris reservoir is generated by YORP-induced rotational fission during the giant branch phases of stellar evolution, where the stellar luminosity can exceed the Sun's by four orders of magnitude. Here, we determine the efficacy of the giant branch YORP effect for asteroids with non-zero internal strength, and model post-fission evolution by imposing simple analytic fragmentation prescriptions. We find that even the highest realistic internal strengths cannot prevent the widespread fragmentation of asteroids and the production of a debris field over 100 au in size. We compute the number of successive fission events as they occur in progressively smaller time intervals as the star ascends the giant branches, providing a way to generate size distributions of asteroid fragments. The results are highly insensitive to progenitor stellar mass. We also conclude that the ease with which giant branch YORP break-up can generate binary asteroid subsystems is strongly dependent on internal strength. Formed binary subsystems in turn could be short-lived due to the resulting luminosity-enhanced binary YORP (BYORP) effect.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.2437V
LSQ13ddu: a rapidly evolving stripped-envelope supernova with early circumstellar interaction signatures;;This paper describes the rapidly evolving and unusual supernova LSQ13ddu, discovered by the La Silla-QUEST survey. LSQ13ddu displayed a rapid rise of just 4.8 ± 0.9 d to reach a peak brightness of -19.70 ± 0.02 mag in the LSQgr band. Early spectra of LSQ13ddu showed the presence of weak and narrow He I features arising from interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). These interaction signatures weakened quickly, with broad features consistent with those seen in stripped-envelope SNe becoming dominant around two weeks after maximum. The narrow He I velocities are consistent with the wind velocities of luminous blue variables but its spectra lack the typically seen hydrogen features. The fast and bright early light curve is inconsistent with radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni powering but can be explained through a combination of CSM interaction and an underlying <SUP>56</SUP>Ni decay component that dominates the later time behaviour of LSQ13ddu. Based on the strength of the underlying broad features, LSQ13ddu appears deficient in He compared to standard SNe Ib.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.2208C
Implications of the search for optical counterparts during the first six months of the Advanced LIGO's and Advanced Virgo's third observing run: possible limits on the ejecta mass and binary properties;;GW170817 showed that neutron star mergers not only emit gravitational waves but also can release electromagnetic signatures in multiple wavelengths. Within the first half of the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, there have been a number of gravitational wave candidates of compact binary systems for which at least one component is potentially a neutron star. In this article, we look at the candidates S190425z, S190426c, S190510g, S190901ap, and S190910h, predicted to have potentially a non-zero remnant mass, in more detail. All these triggers have been followed up with extensive campaigns by the astronomical community doing electromagnetic searches for their optical counterparts; however, according to the released classification, there is a high probability that some of these events might not be of extraterrestrial origin. Assuming that the triggers are caused by a compact binary coalescence and that the individual source locations have been covered during the EM follow-up campaigns, we employ three different kilonova models and apply them to derive possible constraints on the matter ejection consistent with the publicly available gravitational-wave trigger information and the lack of a kilonova detection. These upper bounds on the ejecta mass can be related to limits on the maximum mass of the binary neutron star candidate S190425z and to constraints on the mass-ratio, spin, and NS compactness for the potential black hole-neutron star candidate S190426c. Our results show that deeper electromagnetic observations for future gravitational wave events near the horizon limit of the advanced detectors are essential.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492..863C
Constraining the fraction of core-collapse supernovae harbouring choked jets with high-energy neutrinos;;The joint observation of core-collapse supernovae with gamma-ray bursts shows that jets can be launched in the aftermath of stellar core collapse, likely by a newly formed black hole that accretes matter from the star. Such gamma-ray bursts have only been observed accompanying Type Ibc supernovae, indicating a stellar progenitor that lost its hydrogen envelope before collapse. According to recent hypothesis, it is possible that jets are launched in core-collapse events even when the progenitors still retain their hydrogen envelopes; however, such jets are not able to burrow through the star and will be stalled into the interior of the progenitor star before escaping. These jets are called choked jets. High-energy neutrinos produced by such choked jets could escape the stellar envelope and could be observed. Here, we examine how multimessenger searches for high-energy neutrinos and core-collapse supernovae can detect or limit the fraction of stellar collapses that produce jets. We find that a high fraction of jet production is already limited by previous observational campaigns. We explore possibilities with future observations using Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, IceCube, and Km3NET.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492..843G
Self-intersection of the fallback stream in tidal disruption events;;We propose a semi-analytical model for the self-intersection of the fallback stream in tidal disruption events (TDEs). When the initial periapsis is less than about 15 gravitational radii, a large fraction of the shocked gas is unbound in the form of a collision-induced outflow (CIO). This is because large apsidal precession causes the stream to self-intersect near the local escape speed at radius much below the apocentre. The rest of the fallback gas is left in more tightly bound orbits and quickly joins the accretion flow. We propose that the CIO is responsible for reprocessing the hard emission from the accretion flow into the optical band. This picture naturally explains the large photospheric radius [or low blackbody (BB) temperature] and typical line widths for optical TDEs. We predict the CIO-reprocessed spectrum in the infrared to be L<SUB>ν</SUB> ∝ ν<SUP>∼0.5</SUP>, shallower than a BB. The partial sky coverage of the CIO also provides a unification of the diverse X-ray behaviours of optical TDEs. According to this picture, optical surveys filter out a large fraction of TDEs with low-mass blackholes due to lack of a reprocessing layer, and the volumetric rate of optical TDEs is nearly flat wrt. the blackhole mass in the range M≲ 10^7 M_{⊙}. This filtering also causes the optical TDE rate to be lower than the total rate by a factor of ∼10 or more. When the CIO is decelerated by the ambient medium, radio emission at the level of that in ASASSN-14li is produced, but the time-scales and peak luminosities can be highly diverse. Finally, our method paves the way for global simulations of the disc formation process by injecting gas at the intersection point according to the prescribed velocity and density profiles.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492..686L
Pulsation in faint blue stars;;Following the discovery of blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) by the OGLE survey, additional hot, high-amplitude pulsating stars have been discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility. It has been proposed that all of these objects are low-mass pre-white dwarfs and that their pulsations are driven by the opacity of iron-group elements. With this expanded population of pulsating objects, it was decided to compute a sequence of post-common-envelope stellar models using the MESA stellar evolution code and to examine the pulsation properties of low-mass pre-white dwarfs using non-adiabatic analysis with the GYRE stellar oscillation code. By including the effects of atomic diffusion and radiative levitation, it is shown that a large region of instability exists from effective temperatures of 30 000 K up to temperatures of at least 50 000 K and at a wide range of surface gravities. This encompasses both groups of pulsator observed so far, and confirms that the driving mechanism is through iron group element opacity. We make some conservative estimates about the range of periods, masses, temperatures, and gravities in which further such pulsators might be observed.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492..232B
Probing the extragalactic fast transient sky at minute time-scales with DECam;;Searches for optical transients are usually performed with a cadence of days to weeks, optimized for supernova discovery. The optical fast transient sky is still largely unexplored, with only a few surveys to date having placed meaningful constraints on the detection of extragalactic transients evolving at sub-hour time-scales. Here, we present the results of deep searches for dim, minute-time-scale extragalactic fast transients using the Dark Energy Camera, a core facility of our all-wavelength and all-messenger Deeper, Wider, Faster programme. We used continuous 20 s exposures to systematically probe time-scales down to 1.17 min at magnitude limits g > 23 (AB), detecting hundreds of transient and variable sources. Nine candidates passed our strict criteria on duration and non-stellarity, all of which could be classified as flare stars based on deep multiband imaging. Searches for fast radio burst and gamma-ray counterparts during simultaneous multifacility observations yielded no counterparts to the optical transients. Also, no long-term variability was detected with pre-imaging and follow-up observations using the SkyMapper optical telescope. We place upper limits for minute-time-scale fast optical transient rates for a range of depths and time-scales. Finally, we demonstrate that optical g-band light-curve behaviour alone cannot discriminate between confirmed extragalactic fast transients such as prompt GRB flashes and Galactic stellar flares.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491.5852A
Understanding extreme quasar optical variability with CRTS - II. Changing-state quasars;;We present the results of a systematic search for quasars in the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey exhibiting both strong photometric variability and spectroscopic variability over a decadal baseline. We identify 111 sources with specific patterns of optical and mid-infrared photometric behaviour and a defined spectroscopic change. These 'changing-state' quasars (CSQs) form a higher luminosity sample to complement existing sets of 'changing-look' AGNs and quasars in the literature. The CSQs (by selection) exhibit larger photometric variability than the changing-look quasars (CLQs). The spectroscopic variability is marginally stronger in the CSQs than CLQs as defined by the change in H β/[O III] ratio. We find 48 sources with declining H β flux and 63 sources with increasing H β flux, and discover 8 sources with z > 0.8, further extending the redshift arm. Our CSQ sample compares to the literature CLQ objects in similar distributions of H β flux ratios and differential Eddington ratios between high (bright) and low (dim) states. Taken as a whole, we find that this population of extreme varying quasars is associated with changes in the Eddington ratio and the time-scales imply cooling/heating fronts propagating through the disc.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491.4925G
Observation of the Second LIGO/Virgo Event Connected with a Binary Neutron Star Merger S190425z in the Gamma-Ray Range;;The results of observations of the gravitational-wave (GW) event S190425z recorded by the LIGO/Virgo detectors with the anti-coincidence shield (ACS) of the SPI gamma-ray spectrometer onboard the INTEGRAL observatory are presented. With a high probability (>99%) it was associated with a neutron star (NS) merger in a close binary system. This is only the second event of such a type in the history of gravitational-wave observations (after GW170817). A weak gamma-ray burst, GRB190425, consisting of two pulses ∼0.5 and ∼5.9 s after the NS merger in the event S190425z with an a priori significance of 3.5 and 4.4σ (taken together 5.5σ) was detected by SPI-ACS. Analysis of the SPI-ACS count rate history recorded on these days (a total of ∼125 ks of observations) has shown that the rate of random occurrence of two close spikes with the characteristics of GRB190425 does not exceed 6.4 × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> (i.e., such events occur by chance, on average, every ∼4.3 hours). Note that the time profile of GRB190425 has much in common with the profile of GRB170817A accompanying the event GW170817, that both NS mergers were the nearest (≤150 Mpc) of all the events recorded by the LIGO/Virgo detectors, and that no significant excesses of the gamma-ray flux above the background were detected in any of ∼30 black hole merger events recorded to date by these detectors. No bursts of hard radiation were detected in the field of view of the SPI and IBIS/ISGRI gamma-ray telescopes onboard INTEGRAL. This, along with the absence of detection of gamma-ray emission from GRB190425 by the GBM gamma-ray burst monitor of the Fermi observatory suggesting its occultation by the Earth, allows the localization region for the source of this GWevent to be reduced significantly. The parameters E<SUB>iso</SUB> and E<SUB>p</SUB> for GRB190425 are estimated and compared with those for GRB170817A.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AstL...45..710P
Rapid Transients Originating from Thermonuclear Explosions in Helium White Dwarf Tidal Disruption Events;;We study the emission properties of thermonuclear explosions in a helium white dwarf (WD) tidal disruption event (TDE). We consider a TDE where a 0.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> helium WD is disrupted by a 10<SUP>2.5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). The helium WD is not only tidally disrupted but is also detonated by the tidal compression and by succeeding shocks. We focus on the emission powered by radioactive nuclei in the unbound TDE ejecta. We perform hydrodynamic simulations coupled with nuclear reactions, post-process detailed nucleosynthesis calculations, and radiative transfer simulations. We thus derive multi-band light curves and spectra. The helium WD TDE shows rapid (Δt<SUB>1mag</SUB> ≃ 5-10 days) and relatively faint ( ${L}_{\mathrm{peak}}\simeq {10}^{42}\,\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}$ ) light curves, because the ejecta mass and <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass are low (0.12 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and 0.03 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, respectively). The spectra show strong calcium and Fe-peak features and very weak silicon features, reflecting the peculiar elemental abundance. The key feature is the Doppler shift of the spectral lines up to ≃ ±12,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, depending on the viewing angle, due to the bulk motion of the ejecta. Our model matches well with two rapid and faint transients reported in Pursiainen et al. The particular model presented here does not match with observed SNe Iax, calcium-rich transients, or .Ia explosion candidates, either in the spectra or light curves. However, we expect a large variety of observational signatures once a wide range of the WD/black hole masses and orbital parameters are considered. This study contributes to the search for WD TDEs with current and upcoming surveys, and to the identification of IMBHs as disrupters in TDEs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...890L..26K
A New Method to Classify Type IIP/IIL Supernovae Based on Their Spectra;;Type IIP and Type IIL supernovae are defined on the basis of their light curves, but the spectral criteria for distinguishing these two types of supernovae (SNe) remain unclear. We propose a spectral classification method. First, we subtract the principal components of different wavelength bands in the spectra based on the functional principal components analysis method. Then, we use support vector machine and artificial neural network to classify these two types of SNe. The best F1_Score of our classifier is 0.871 for SNe IIL, and 0.974 for SNe IIP. We found that by only using the H<SUB>α</SUB> line at 6150-6800 Å for classification, the F1_Score up to 0.961 for Type IIP, and 0.818 for Type IIL SNe can be obtained. These results indicate that the profile of the H<SUB>α</SUB> spectral line is the key to distinguishing the two types of SNe.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...890..177K
GROWTH on S190814bv: Deep Synoptic Limits on the Optical/Near-infrared Counterpart to a Neutron Star-Black Hole Merger;;On 2019 August 14, the Advanced LIGO and Virgo interferometers detected the high-significance gravitational wave (GW) signal S190814bv. The GW data indicated that the event resulted from a neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger, or potentially a low-mass binary BH merger. Due to the low false-alarm rate and the precise localization (23 deg<SUP>2</SUP> at 90%), S190814bv presented the community with the best opportunity yet to directly observe an optical/near-infrared counterpart to an NSBH merger. To search for potential counterparts, the GROWTH Collaboration performed real-time image subtraction on six nights of public Dark Energy Camera images acquired in the 3 weeks following the merger, covering >98% of the localization probability. Using a worldwide network of follow-up facilities, we systematically undertook spectroscopy and imaging of optical counterpart candidates. Combining these data with a photometric redshift catalog, we ruled out each candidate as the counterpart to S190814bv and placed deep, uniform limits on the optical emission associated with S190814bv. For the nearest consistent GW distance, radiative transfer simulations of NSBH mergers constrain the ejecta mass of S190814bv to be M<SUB>ej</SUB> < 0.04 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> at polar viewing angles, or M<SUB>ej</SUB> < 0.03 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> if the opacity is κ < 2 cm<SUP>2</SUP>g<SUP>-1</SUP>. Assuming a tidal deformability for the NS at the high end of the range compatible with GW170817 results, our limits would constrain the BH spin component aligned with the orbital momentum to be χ < 0.7 for mass ratios Q < 6, with weaker constraints for more compact NSs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...890..131A
Simulating Turbulence-aided Neutrino-driven Core-collapse Supernova Explosions in One Dimension;;The core-collapse supernova (CCSN) mechanism is fundamentally 3D, with instabilities, convection, and turbulence playing crucial roles in aiding neutrino-driven explosions. Simulations of CCNSe including accurate treatments of neutrino transport and sufficient resolution to capture key instabilities remain among the most expensive numerical simulations in astrophysics, prohibiting large parameter studies in 2D and 3D. Studies spanning a large swath of the incredibly varied initial conditions of CCSNe are possible in 1D, though such simulations must be artificially driven to explode. We present a new method for including the most important effects of convection and turbulence in 1D simulations of neutrino-driven CCSNe, called Supernova Turbulence In Reduced-dimensionality, or STIR. Our new approach includes crucial terms resulting from the turbulent and convective motions of the flow. We estimate the strength of convection and turbulence using a modified mixing-length theory approach, introducing a few free parameters to the model that are fit to the results of 3D simulations. For sufficiently large values of the mixing-length parameter, turbulence-aided neutrino-driven explosions are obtained. We compare the results of STIR to high-fidelity 3D simulations and perform a parameter study of CCSN explosion using 200 solar-metallicity progenitor models from 9 to 120 ${M}_{\odot }$ . We find that STIR is a better predictor of which models will explode in multidimensional simulations than other methods of driving explosions in 1D. We also present a preliminary investigation of predicted observable characteristics of the CCSN population from STIR, such as the distributions of explosion energies and remnant masses.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...890..127C
The Prospects of Observing Tidal Disruption Events with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope;;The upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will observe 18,000 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of the southern sky and is expected to discover thousands of transients every night due to its large coverage area and its observing strategy. In this work, we address the prospects for the LSST in discovering tidal disruption events (TDEs) and in probing the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass distribution in the universe. We used the LSST simulation framework and defined TDE catalogs on 20 fields of 20.25 deg<SUP>2</SUP> size. TDE properties were defined by randomly chosen impact factors and SMBH masses drawn from six different mass distributions. Observations of TDEs over 10 years of LSST operation were simulated by querying the simulated observing strategy database minion_1016. Based on the results of our simulations, we estimate that the LSST should discover between 35,000 and 80,000 TDEs in 10 years of operation, depending on the assumed SMBH mass distribution. We also find that probing the SMBH mass distribution with TDE observations will not be straightforward, due to the fact that TDEs caused by low-mass black holes (10<SUP>5</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) are expected to be less luminous and shorter than TDEs by heavier SMBHs (> 10<SUP>6</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), and therefore will mostly be missed by the irregular LSST cadence minion_1016.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...890...73B
Possible Formation Scenarios of ZTF J153932.16+502738.8—A Gravitational Source Close to the Peak of LISA's Sensitivity;;ZTF J153932.16+502738.8 (ZTFJ1539) is an eclipsing double-white-dwarf system with an orbital period of 6.91 minutes, and a significant source for LISA detection of gravitational waves. However, the massive white dwarf (WD), with a mass of about 0.61 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, has a high effective temperature (48,900 K), and the lower-mass WD, with a mass of about 0.21 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, has a low effective temperature (<10,000 K). This discrepancy challenges the popular theory of binary evolution. We investigate the formation of ZTFJ1539 via nova and Algol scenarios. Assuming that the massive WD in ZTFJ1539 just experiences a thermonuclear runaway, the nova scenario can explain the effective temperatures of the two WDs in ZTFJ1539. However, in order to enlarge a semi-detached orbit of about 4-5 minutes to a detached orbit of about 7 minutes, the nova scenario needs a much higher kick velocity of about 200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> during nova eruption. The high kick velocity can result in a high eccentricity of about 0.2-0.6. The Algol scenario can also produce ZTFJ1539 if we take a high efficient parameter for ejecting the common envelope and enhance the mass-loss rate via stellar wind trigger by tidal effect.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...890...69L
Superflares on Solar-type Stars from the First Year Observation of TESS;;Superflares, which are strong explosions on stars, have been well studied with the progress of spacetime-domain astronomy. In this work, we present the study of superflares on solar-type stars using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data. Thirteen sectors of observations during the first year of the TESS mission covered the southern hemisphere of the sky, containing 25,734 solar-type stars. We verified 1216 superflares on 400 solar-type stars through automatic search and visual inspection with 2 minute cadence data. Our result suggests a higher superflare frequency distribution than the result from Kepler. This may be because the majority of TESS solar-type stars in our data set are rapidly rotating stars. The power-law index γ of the superflare frequency distribution ( ${dN}/{dE}\propto {E}^{-\gamma }$ ) is constrained to be γ = 2.16 ± 0.10, which is a little larger than that of solar flares but consistent with the results from Kepler. Because only seven superflares of Sun-like stars are detected, we cannot give a robust superflare occurrence frequency. Four stars were accompanied by unconfirmed hot planet candidates. Therefore, superflares may possibly be caused by stellar magnetic activities instead of planet-star interactions. We also find an extraordinary star, TIC43472154, which exhibits about 200 superflares per year. In addition, the correlation between the energy and duration of superflares ( ${T}_{\mathrm{duration}}\propto {E}^{\beta }$ ) is analyzed. We derive the power-law index to be β = 0.42 ± 0.01, which is a little larger than β = 1/3 from the prediction according to magnetic reconnection theory.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...890...46T
An Extreme X-Ray Variability Event of a Weak-line Quasar;;We report the discovery of an extreme X-ray flux rise (by a factor of ≳20) of the weak-line quasar Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) J153913.47+395423.4 (hereafter SDSS J1539+3954) at z = 1.935. SDSS J1539+3954 is the most-luminous object among radio-quiet type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) where such dramatic X-ray variability has been observed. Before the X-ray flux rise, SDSS J1539+3954 appeared X-ray weak compared with the expectation from its ultraviolet (UV) flux; after the rise, the ratio of its X-ray flux and UV flux is consistent with the majority of the AGN population. We also present a contemporaneous HET spectrum of SDSS J1539+3954, which demonstrates that its UV continuum level remains generally unchanged despite the dramatic increase in the X-ray flux, and its C IV emission line remains weak. The dramatic change only observed in the X-ray flux is consistent with a shielding model, where a thick inner accretion disk can block our line of sight to the central X-ray source. This thick inner accretion disk can also block the nuclear ionizing photons from reaching the high-ionization broad emission-line region, so that weak high-ionization emission lines are observed. Under this scenario, the extreme X-ray variability event may be caused by slight variations in the thickness of the disk. This event might also be explained by gravitational light-bending effects in a reflection model.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...889L..37N
Diversity of Kilonova Light Curves;;We perform radiative transfer simulations for kilonova in various situations, including the cases of prompt collapse to a black hole from neutron star mergers, high-velocity ejecta possibly accelerated by magnetars, and a black hole-neutron star merger. Our calculations are done employing ejecta profiles predicted by numerical-relativity simulations and a new line list for all the r-process elements. We found that: (I) the optical emission for binary neutron stars promptly collapsing to a black hole would be fainter by ≳1-2 mag than that found in GW170817, while the infrared emission could be as bright as that in GW170817 if the post-merger ejecta is as massive as ≈0.01 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>; (II) the kilonova would be brighter than that observed in GW170817 for the case that the ejecta is highly accelerated by the electromagnetic energy injection from the remnant, but within a few days it would decline rapidly and the magnitude would become fainter than in GW170817; and (III) the optical emission from a black hole-neutron star merger ejecta could be as bright as that observed in GW170817 for the case that sufficiently large amount of matter is ejected (≳0.02 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), while the infrared brightness would be brighter by 1-2 mag at the same time. We show that the difference in the ejecta properties would be imprinted in the differences in the peak brightness and time of peak. This indicates that we may be able to infer the type of the central engine for kilonovae by observation of the peak in the multiple band.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...889..171K
Pre-discovery Activity of New Interstellar Comet 2I/Borisov beyond 5 au;;Comet 2I/Borisov, the first unambiguous interstellar comet ever found, was discovered in 2019 August at ∼3 au from the Sun on its inbound leg. No pre-discovery detection beyond 3 au has yet been reported, mostly due to the comet's proximity to the Sun as seen from the Earth. Here we present a search for pre-discovery detections of comet Borisov using images taken by the Catalina Sky Survey, Pan-STARRS, and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), with a further comprehensive follow-up campaign being presented in Bolin et al. We identified comet Borisov in ZTF images taken in 2019 May and use these data to update its orbit. This allowed us to identify the comet in images acquired as far back as 2018 December, when it was 7.8 au from the Sun. The comet was not detected in 2018 November when it was 8.6 au from the Sun, possibly implying an onset of activity around this time. This suggests that the activity of the comet is either driven by a more volatile species other than H<SUB>2</SUB>O, such as CO or CO<SUB>2</SUB>, or by exothermic crystallization of amorphous ice. We derive the radius of the nucleus to be <7 km using the non-detection in 2018 November, and estimate an area of ∼0.5- $10\,{\mathrm{km}}^{2}$ has been active between 2018 December and 2019 September, though this number is model-dependent and is highly uncertain. The behavior of comet Borisov during its inbound leg is observationally consistent with dynamically new comets observed in our solar system, suggesting some similarities between the two.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....159...77Y
A Twilight Search for Atiras, Vatiras, and Co-orbital Asteroids: Preliminary Results;;Near-Earth objects (NEOs) that orbit the Sun on or within Earth's orbit are tricky to detect for Earth-based observers due to their proximity to the Sun in the sky. These small bodies hold clues to the dynamical history of the inner solar system as well as the physical evolution of planetesimals in extreme environments. Populations in this region include the Atira and Vatira asteroids, as well as Venus and Earth co-orbital asteroids. Here we present a twilight search for these small bodies, conducted using the 1.2 m Oschin Schmidt and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) camera at Palomar Observatory. The ZTF twilight survey operates at solar elongations down to 35° with a limiting magnitude of r = 19.5. During a total of 40 evening sessions and 62 morning sessions conducted between 2018 November 15 and 2019 June 23, we detected six Atiras, including two new discoveries, 2019 AQ<SUB>3</SUB> and 2019 LF<SUB>6</SUB>, but no Vatiras or Earth/Venus co-orbital asteroids. NEO population models show that these new discoveries are likely only the tip of the iceberg, with the bulk of the population yet to be found. The population models also suggest that we have only detected 5%-7% of the H < 20 Atira population over the seven month survey. Co-orbital asteroids are smaller in diameter and require deeper surveys. A systematic and efficient survey of the near-Sun region will require deeper searches and/or facilities that can operate at small solar elongations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....159...70Y
ZTF18abhjrcf: The First R Coronae Borealis Star from the Zwicky Transient Facility Public Survey;;R Coronae Borealis stars (RCBs) constitute a rare class of stars that are hydrogen depleted and carbon enriched, possibly from white dwarf mergers. RCBs are identified by their stochastic dimming with photometric variations of as much as eight magnitudes. Hence, the discoveries of RCBs were heavily biased to the limited regions monitored by long-term microlensing experiments. However, recent studies of galactic RCBs have shown that they exhibit distinct mid-infrared colors originating from their cool circumstellar shells. The all-sky Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) survey thus facilitates the identification of RCB candidates. Therefore, combining the WISE colors with large-area time-domain surveys will enable us to discover more RCBs. Here we present the results of a first attempt to identify RCBs in the public Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream, using the alert broker ANTARES. We identify a candidate RCB using the infrared color selection by Tisserand et al. and large light curve variations in the optical from ZTF. We then conduct subsequent observations using the FLOYDS spectrograph at the Las Cumbres Observatory and confirm ZTF18abhjrcf as a bona fide RCB. This demonstrates the potential to discover uncharted RCBs as ZTF and other time-domain surveys continue to operate.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....159...61L
Gravity and limb-darkening coefficients for compact stars: DA, DB, and DBA eclipsing white dwarfs;;Context. The distribution of the specific intensity over the stellar disk is an essential tool for modeling the light curves in eclipsing binaries, planetary transits, and stellar diameters through interferometric techniques, line profiles in rotating stars, gravitational microlensing, etc. However, the available theoretical calculations are mostly restricted to stars on the main sequence or the giant branch, and very few calculations are available for compact stars. 
 Aims: The main objective of the present work is to extend these investigations by computing the gravity and limb-darkening coefficients for white dwarf atmosphere models with hydrogen, helium, or mixed compositions (types DA, DB, and DBA). 
 Methods: We computed gravity and limb-darkening coefficients for DA, DB, and DBA white dwarfs atmosphere models, covering the transmission curves of the Sloan, UBVRI, Kepler, TESS, and Gaia photometric systems. Specific calculations for the HiPERCAM instrument were also carried out. For all calculations of the limb-darkening coefficients we used the least-squares method. Concerning the effects of tidal and rotational distortions, we also computed for the first time the gravity-darkening coefficients y(λ) for white dwarfs using the same models of stellar atmospheres as in the case of limb-darkening. A more general differential equation was introduced to derive these quantities, including the partial derivative (∂ln I<SUB>o</SUB>(λ)/∂ln g)<SUB>T<SUB>eff</SUB></SUB>. 
 Results: Six laws were adopted to describe the specific intensity distribution: linear, quadratic, square root, logarithmic, power-2, and a more general one with four coefficients. The computations are presented for the chemical compositions log[H/He] = -10.0 (DB), -2.0 (DBA) and He/H = 0 (DA), with log g varying between 5.0 and 9.5 and effective temperatures between 3750 and 100 000 K. For effective temperatures higher than 40 000 K, the models were also computed adopting nonlocal thermal equilibirum (DA).

MAXIMASK and MAXITRACK: Two new tools for identifying contaminants in astronomical images using convolutional neural networks;;In this work, we propose two convolutional neural network classifiers for detecting contaminants in astronomical images. Once trained, our classifiers are able to identify various contaminants, such as cosmic rays, hot and bad pixels, persistence effects, satellite or plane trails, residual fringe patterns, nebulous features, saturated pixels, diffraction spikes, and tracking errors in images. They encompass a broad range of ambient conditions, such as seeing, image sampling, detector type, optics, and stellar density. The first classifier, MAXIMASK, performs semantic segmentation and generates bad pixel maps for each contaminant, based on the probability that each pixel belongs to a given contaminant class. The second classifier, MAXITRACK, classifies entire images and mosaics, by computing the probability for the focal plane to be affected by tracking errors. We gathered training and testing data from real data originating from various modern charged-coupled devices and near-infrared cameras, that are augmented with image simulations. We quantified the performance of both classifiers and show that MAXIMASK achieves state-of-the-art performance for the identification of cosmic ray hits. Thanks to a built-in Bayesian update mechanism, both classifiers can be tuned to meet specific science goals in various observational contexts.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A&A...634A..48P
Web application for galaxy-targeted follow-up of electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave sources;;The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo Collaboration's Observing Run 3 has demanded the development of widely-applicable tools for gravitational wave follow-up. These tools must address the main challenges of the multi-messenger era, namely covering large localisation regions and quickly identifying decaying transients. To address these challenges, we present a public web interface to assist astronomers in conducting galaxy-targeted follow-up of gravitational wave events by offering a fast and public list of targets post-gravitational wave trigger. After a gravitational wave trigger, the back-end galaxy retrieval algorithm identifies and scores galaxies based on the LIGO and Virgo computed probabilities and properties of the galaxies taken from the Galaxy List for the Advanced Detector Era V2 galaxy catalogue. Within minutes, the user can retrieve, download, and limit ranked galaxy lists from the web application. The algorithm and website have been tested on past gravitational wave events, and execution times have been analysed. The algorithm is being triggered automatically during Observing Run 3 and its features will be extended if needed. The web application was developed using the Python based Flask web framework. 

The web application is freely available and publicly accessible at <A href="https://gwtool.watchertelescope.ie/">https://gwtool.watchertelescope.ie</A>.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A&A...634A..32S
A search for the origin of the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov;;The discovery of the second interstellar object 2I/Borisov on 2019 August 30 raises the question of whether it was ejected recently from a nearby stellar system. Here we compute the asymptotic incoming trajectory of 2I/Borisov, based on both recent and pre-discovery data extending back to December 2018, using a range of force models that account for cometary outgassing. From Gaia DR2 astrometry and radial velocities, we trace back in time the Galactic orbits of 7.4 million stars to look for close encounters with 2I/Borisov. The closest encounter we find took place 910 kyr ago with the M0V star Ross 573, at a separation of 0.068 pc (90% confidence interval of 0.053-0.091 pc) with a relative velocity of 23 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. This encounter is nine times closer than the closest past encounter identified for the first interstellar object 1I/`Oumuamua. Ejection of 2I/Borisov via a three-body encounter in a binary or planetary system is possible, although such a large ejection velocity is unlikely to be obtained and Ross 573 shows no signs of binarity. We also identify and discuss some other recent close encounters, recognizing that if 2I/Borisov is more than about 10 Myr old, our search would be unlikely to find its parent system.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A&A...634A..14B
Complementarity of peculiar velocity surveys and redshift space distortions for testing gravity;;Peculiar-velocity surveys of the low-redshift universe have significant leverage to constrain the growth rate of cosmic structure and test gravity. Wide-field imaging surveys combined with multiobject spectrographs [e.g., ZTF2, Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), DESI, and 4MOST] can use type Ia supernovae as informative tracers of the velocity field, reaching few percent constraints on the growth rate f σ<SUB>8</SUB> at z ≲0.2 where density tracers cannot do better than ∼10 %. Combining the high-redshift DESI survey mapping redshift space distortions with a low-redshift supernova peculiar velocity survey using LSST and DESI can determine the gravitational growth index to σ (γ )≈0.02 , testing general relativity. We study the characteristics needed for the peculiar velocity survey, and how its complementarity with clustering surveys improves when going from a Λ CDM model assumption to a w<SUB>0</SUB>- w<SUB>a</SUB> cosmology.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PhRvD.101b3516K
A systematic study of spiral density waves in the accretion discs of cataclysmic variables;;Spiral density waves are thought to be excited in the accretion discs of accreting compact objects, including cataclysmic variable stars (CVs). Observational evidence has been obtained for a handful of systems in outburst over the last two decades. We present the results of a systematic study searching for spiral density waves in CVs, and report their detection in two of the sixteen observed systems. While most of the systems observed present asymmetric, non-Keplerian accretion discs during outburst, the presence of ordered structures interpreted as spiral density waves is not as ubiquitous as previously anticipated. From a comparison of systems by their system parameters it appears that inclination of the systems may play a major role, favouring the visibility and/or detection of spiral waves in systems seen at high inclination.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491.2217R
Polarimetry of relativistic tidal disruption event Swift J2058+0516;;A small fraction of candidate tidal disruption events (TDEs) show evidence of powerful relativistic jets, which are particularly pronounced at radio wavelengths, and likely contribute non-thermal emission at a wide range of wavelengths. A non-thermal emission component can be diagnosed using linear polarimetry, even when the total received light is dominated by emission from an accretion disc or disc outflow. In this paper, we present Very Large Telescope (VLT) measurements of the linear polarization of the optical light of jetted TDE Swift J2058+0516. This is the second jetted TDE studied in this manner, after Swift J1644+57. We find evidence of non-zero optical linear polarization, P<SUB>V</SUB>∼ 8 per cent, a level very similar to the near-infrared polarimetry of Swift J1644+57. These detections provide an independent test of the emission mechanisms of the multiwavelength emission of jetted TDEs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491.1771W
Detecting gravitational self-lensing from stellar-mass binaries composed of black holes or neutron stars;;We explore a unique electromagnetic signature of stellar-mass compact-object binaries long before they are detectable in gravitational waves. We show that gravitational lensing of light emitting components of a compact-object binary, by the other binary component, could be detectable in the nearby Universe. This periodic lensing signature could be detected from present and future X-ray observations, identifying the progenitors of binaries that merge in the LIGO band, and also unveiling populations that do not merge, thus providing a tracer of the compact-object binary population in an enigmatic portion of its life. We argue that periodically repeating lensing flares could be observed for ≲100 ks orbital-period binaries with the future Lynx X-ray mission, possibly concurrent with gravitational wave emission in the LISA band. Binaries with longer orbital periods could be more common and be detectable as single lensing flares, though with reliance on a model for the flare that can be tested by observations of succeeding flares. Non-detection of such events, even with existing X-ray observations, will help to constrain the population of EM bright compact-object binaries.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491.1506D
Prospects of cosmic superstring detection through microlensing of extragalactic point-like sources;;The existence of cosmic superstrings may be probed by astronomical time domain surveys. When crossing the line of sight to point-like sources, strings produce a distinctive microlensing signature. We consider two avenues to hunt for a relic population of superstring loops: frequent monitoring of (1) stars in Andromeda, lensed by loops in the haloes of the Milky-Way and Andromeda and (2) supernovae at cosmological distances, lensed by loops in the intergalactic medium. We assess the potential of such experiments to detect and/or constrain strings with a range of tensions, 10<SUP>-15</SUP> ≲ Gμ/c<SUP>2</SUP> ≲ 10<SUP>-6</SUP>. The practical sensitivity is tied to cadence of observations which we explore in detail. We forecast that high-cadence monitoring of ∼10<SUP>5</SUP> stars on the far side of Andromeda over a year-long period will detect microlensing events if Gμ/c<SUP>2</SUP> ∼ 10<SUP>-13</SUP>, while ∼10<SUP>6</SUP> stars will detect events if 10<SUP>-13.5</SUP> < Gμ/c<SUP>2</SUP> < 10<SUP>-11.5</SUP>; the upper and lower bounds of the accessible tension range continue to expand as the number of stars rises. We also analyse the ability to reject models in the absence of fluctuations. While challenging, these studies are within reach of forthcoming time-domain surveys. Supernova observations can hypothetically constrain models with 10<SUP>-12</SUP> < Gμ/c<SUP>2</SUP> < 10<SUP>-6</SUP> without any optimization of the survey cadence. However, the event rate forecast suggests it will be difficult to reject models of interest. As a demonstration, we use observations from the Pantheon Type Ia supernova cosmology data set to place modest constraints on the number density of cosmic superstrings in a poorly tested region of the parameter space.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491..596C
Robotilter: an automated lens/CCD alignment system for the Evryscope;;Camera lenses are increasingly used in wide-field astronomical surveys due to their high performance, wide field-of-view (FOV) unreachable from traditional telescope optics, and modest cost. The machining and assembly tolerances for commercially available optical systems cause a slight misalignment (tilt) between the lens and CCD, resulting in point spread function (PSF) degradation. We have built an automated alignment system (Robotilters) to solve this challenge, optimizing four degrees of freedom—two tilt axes, a separation axis (the distance between the CCD and lens), and the lens focus (the built-in focus of the lens by turning the lens focusing ring, which moves the optical elements relative to one another) in a compact and low-cost package. The Robotilters remove tilt and optimize focus at the sub-10-μm level, are completely automated, take ≈2 h to run, and remain stable for multiple years once aligned. The Robotilters were built for the Evryscope telescope (a 780-MPix 22-camera array with an 8150-sq. deg FOV and continuous 2-min cadence) designed to detect short-timescale events across extremely large sky areas simultaneously. Variance in quality across the image field, especially the corners and edges compared to the center, is a significant challenge in wide-field astronomical surveys like the Evryscope. The individual star PSFs (which typically extend only a few pixels) are highly susceptible to slight increases in optical aberrations in this situation. The Robotilter solution resulted in a limiting magnitude improvement of 0.5 mag in the center of the image and 1.0 mag in the corners for typical Evryscope cameras, with less distorted and smaller PSFs (half the extent in the corners and edges in many cases). We describe the Robotilter mechanical and software design, camera alignment results, long-term stability, and image improvement. The potential for general use in wide-field astronomical surveys is also explored.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020JATIS...6a8002R
The Most Rapidly Declining Type I Supernova 2019bkc/ATLAS19dqr;;We report observations of the hydrogen-deficient supernova (SN) 2019bkc/ATLAS19dqr. With B- and r-band decline between peak and 10 days post peak of ${\rm{\Delta }}{m}_{10}(B)=5.24\pm 0.07$ mag and ${\rm{\Delta }}{m}_{10}(r)=3.85\pm 0.10$ mag, respectively, SN 2019bkc is the most rapidly declining SN I discovered so far. While its closest matches are the rapidly declining SN 2005ek and SN 2010X, the light curves and spectra of SN 2019bkc show some unprecedented characteristics. SN 2019bkc appears "hostless," with no identifiable host galaxy near its location, although it may be associated with the galaxy cluster MKW1 at z = 0.02. We evaluate a number of existing models of fast-evolving SNe, and we find that none of them can satisfactorily explain all aspects of SN 2019bkc observations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...889L...6C
The ELM Survey. VIII. Ninety-eight Double White Dwarf Binaries;;We present the final sample of 98 detached double white dwarf (WD) binaries found in the Extremely Low Mass (ELM) Survey, a spectroscopic survey targeting <0.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> He-core WDs completed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey footprint. Over the course of the survey we observed ancillary low-mass WD candidates like GD 278, which we show is a P = 0.19 day double WD binary, as well as candidates that turn out to be field blue straggler/subdwarf A-type stars with luminosities too high to be WDs given their Gaia parallaxes. Here, we define a clean sample of ELM WDs that is complete within our target selection and magnitude range 15 < g<SUB>0</SUB> < 20 mag. The measurements are consistent with 100% of ELM WDs being 0.0089 < P < 1.5 day double WD binaries, 35% of which belong to the Galactic halo. We infer that these are mostly He+CO WD binaries given the measurement constraints. The merger rate of the observed He+CO WD binaries exceeds the formation rate of stable mass-transfer AM CVn binaries by a factor of 25, and so the majority of He+CO WD binaries must experience unstable mass transfer and merge. The systems with the shortest periods, such as J0651+2844, are signature LISA verification binaries that can be studied with gravitational waves and light.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...889...49B
An Optimized Radio Follow-up Strategy for Stripped-envelope Core-collapse Supernovae;;Several ongoing or planned synoptic optical surveys are offering, or will soon be offering, an unprecedented opportunity for discovering larger samples of the rarest types of stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae, such as those associated with relativistic jets, mildly relativistic ejecta, or strong interaction with the circumstellar medium. Observations at radio wavelengths are a useful tool to probe the fastest moving ejecta, as well as denser circumstellar environments, and can thus help us identify the rarest type of core-collapse explosions. Here, we discuss how to set up an efficient radio follow-up program to detect and correctly identify radio-emitting stripped-envelope core-collapse explosions. We use a method similar to the one described in Carbone & Corsi, and determine the optimal timing of GHz radio observations assuming a sensitivity comparable to that of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. The optimization is done so as to ensure that the collected radio observations can identify the type of explosion powering the radio counterpart by using the smallest possible amount of telescope time. We also present a previously unpublished upper limit on the late-time radio emission from supernova iPTF 17cw. Finally, we conclude by discussing implications for follow-up in the X-rays.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...889...36C
On Post-starburst Galaxies Dominating Tidal Disruption Events;;A starburst induced by a galaxy merger may create a relatively thin central stellar disk at radius ≤100 pc. We calculate the rate of tidal disruption events (TDEs) by the inspiraling secondary supermassive black hole (SMBH) through the disk. With a small enough stellar velocity dispersion (σ /{V}<SUB>c</SUB>≤slant 0.1) in the disk, it is shown that 10<SUP>5</SUP>-10<SUP>6</SUP> TDEs of solar-type main-sequence stars per post-starburst galaxy (PSB) can be produced to explain their dominance in producing observed TDEs. Although the time it takes to bring the secondary SMBH to the disk apparently varies in the range of ∼0.1-1 Gyr since the starburst, depending on its landing location and subsequently due to dynamical friction with stars exterior to the central stellar disk in question, the vast majority of TDEs by the secondary SMBH in any individual PSB occur within a time span shorter than ∼30 Myr. Five unique testable predictions of this model are suggested.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...888L..14C
An Information Theory Approach on Deciding Spectroscopic Follow-ups;;Classification and characterization of variable phenomena and transient phenomena are critical for astrophysics and cosmology. These objects are commonly studied using photometric time series or spectroscopic data. Given that many ongoing and future surveys are conducted in a time domain, and given that adding spectra provides further insights but requires more observational resources, it would be valuable to know which objects we should prioritize to have a spectrum in addition to a time series. We propose a methodology in a probabilistic setting that determines a priori which objects are worth taking a spectrum of to obtain better insights, where we focus on the insight of the type of the object (classification). Objects for which we query their spectrum are reclassified using their full spectral information. We first train two classifiers, one that uses photometric data and another that uses photometric and spectroscopic data together. Then for each photometric object we estimate the probability of each possible spectrum outcome. We combine these models in various probabilistic frameworks (strategies), which are used to guide the selection of follow-up observations. The best strategy depends on the intended use, whether it is obtaining more confidence or accuracy. For a given number of candidate objects (127, equal to 5% of the data set) for taking spectra, we improve the class prediction accuracy by 37% as opposed to 20% of a non-naive (non-random) best-baseline strategy. Our approach provides a general framework for follow-up strategies and can be extended beyond classification to include other forms of follow-ups beyond spectroscopy.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....159...16A
The Vanishing and Appearing Sources during a Century of Observations Project. I. USNO Objects Missing in Modern Sky Surveys and Follow-up Observations of a “Missing Star”;;In this paper we report the current status of a new research program. The primary goal of the “Vanishing and Appearing Sources during a Century of Observations” project is to search for vanishing and appearing sources using existing survey data to find examples of exceptional astrophysical transients. The implications of finding such objects extend from traditional astrophysics fields to the more exotic searches for evidence of technologically advanced civilizations. In this first paper we present new, deeper observations of the tentative candidate discovered by Villarroel et al. in 2016. We then perform the first searches for vanishing objects throughout the sky by comparing 600 million objects from the US Naval Observatory Catalogue (USNO) B1.0 down to a limiting magnitude of ∼20-21 with the recent Pan-STARRS Data Release-1 (DR1) with a limiting magnitude of ∼23.4. We find about 150,000 preliminary candidates that do not have any Pan-STARRS counterpart within a 30″ radius. We show that these objects are redder and have larger proper motions than typical USNO objects. We visually examine the images for a subset of about 24,000 candidates, superseding the 2016 study with a sample 10 times larger. We find about 100 point sources visible in only one epoch in the red band of the USNO, which may be of interest in searches for strong M-dwarf flares, high-redshift supernovae, or other categories of unidentified red transients.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....159....8V
Full orbital solution for the binary system in the northern Galactic disc microlensing event Gaia16aye;;Gaia16aye was a binary microlensing event discovered in the direction towards the northern Galactic disc and was one of the first microlensing events detected and alerted to by the Gaia space mission. Its light curve exhibited five distinct brightening episodes, reaching up to I = 12 mag, and it was covered in great detail with almost 25 000 data points gathered by a network of telescopes. We present the photometric and spectroscopic follow-up covering 500 days of the event evolution. We employed a full Keplerian binary orbit microlensing model combined with the motion of Earth and Gaia around the Sun to reproduce the complex light curve. The photometric data allowed us to solve the microlensing event entirely and to derive the complete and unique set of orbital parameters of the binary lensing system. We also report on the detection of the first-ever microlensing space-parallax between the Earth and Gaia located at L2. The properties of the binary system were derived from microlensing parameters, and we found that the system is composed of two main-sequence stars with masses 0.57 ± 0.05 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and 0.36 ± 0.03 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> at 780 pc, with an orbital period of 2.88 years and an eccentricity of 0.30. We also predict the astrometric microlensing signal for this binary lens as it will be seen by Gaia as well as the radial velocity curve for the binary system. Events such as Gaia16aye indicate the potential for the microlensing method of probing the mass function of dark objects, including black holes, in directions other than that of the Galactic bulge. This case also emphasises the importance of long-term time-domain coordinated observations that can be made with a network of heterogeneous telescopes.
