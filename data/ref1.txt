Prospects of Searching for Type Ia Supernovae with 2.5-m Wide Field Survey Telescope;;Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (WDs) and are well-known as a distance indicator. However, it is still unclear how WDs increase their mass near the Chandrasekhar limit and how the thermonuclear runaway happens. The observational clues associated with these open questions, such as the photometric data within hours to days since the explosion, are scarce. Thus, an essential way is to discover SNe Ia at specific epochs with optimal surveys. The 2.5 m Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) is an upcoming survey facility deployed in western China. In this paper, we assess the detectability of SNe Ia with mock observations of the WFST. Followed by the volumetric rate, we generate a spectral series of SNe Ia based on a data-based model and introduce the line-of-sight extinction to calculate the brightness from the observer. By comparing with the detection limit of the WFST, which is affected by the observing conditions, we can count the number of SNe Ia discovered by mock WFST observations. We expect that the WFST can find more than 3.0×104 pre-maximum SNe Ia within one year of running. In particular, the WFST could discover about 45 bright SNe Ia, 99 early phase SNe Ia, or 1.1×104 well-observed SNe Ia with the hypothesized Wide, Deep, or Medium modes, respectively, suggesting that the WFST will be an influential facility in time-domain astronomy.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Univ....9....7H
Constraining the extra polarization modes of gravitational waves with double white dwarfs;;The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new window to test the theory of gravity in the strong field regime. In general relativity (GR), GW can only possess two tensor polarization modes, which are known as the + and × modes. However, vector and scalar modes can exist in some modified theories of gravity, and we can test the gravitational theories by probing these extra polarization modes. As a space-borne GW detector, TianQin will be launched in the 2030s, and it is expected to observe plenty of GW signals, including those from nearly ten thousand double white dwarfs (DWDs) in our galaxy. This offers an excellent chance for testing the existence of extra polarization modes. In this article, we analyze the capability of detecting the extra polarization modes with DWDs. For the extra modes, we consider both the leading order dipole radiation and the sub-leading quadrupole radiation. We find that the capability of TianQin has very strong dependency on the source orientation. We also analyze all the verification binaries with determined position and frequency, and find that ZTF J1539 can give the best constraint on the extra polarization modes. We have also considered the case of TianQin twin constellation, and the joint observation with LISA.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PhRvD.106l4017X
The Spectroscopic Classification of Astronomical Transients (SCAT) Survey: Overview, Pipeline Description, Initial Results, and Future Plans;;We present the Spectroscopic Classification of Astronomical Transients (SCAT) survey, which is dedicated to spectrophotometric observations of transient objects such as supernovae and tidal disruption events. SCAT uses the SuperNova Integral-Field Spectrograph (SNIFS) on the University of Hawai'i 2.2 m (UH2.2m) telescope. SNIFS was designed specifically for accurate transient spectrophotometry, including absolute flux calibration and host-galaxy removal. We describe the data reduction and calibration pipeline including spectral extraction, telluric correction, atmospheric characterization, nightly photometricity, and spectrophotometric precision. We achieve ≲5% spectrophotometry across the full optical wavelength range (3500-9000 Å) under photometric conditions. The inclusion of photometry from the SNIFS multi-filter mosaic imager allows for decent spectrophotometric calibration (10%-20%) even under unfavorable weather/atmospheric conditions. SCAT obtained ≈640 spectra of transients over the first 3 yr of operations, including supernovae of all types, active galactic nuclei, cataclysmic variables, and rare transients such as superluminous supernovae and tidal disruption events. These observations will provide the community with benchmark spectrophotometry to constrain the next generation of hydrodynamic and radiative transfer models.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134l4502T
The first photometric investigation of the poor-thermal contact binary V749 Aurigae;;The multi-filter light curve analysis of V749 Aurigae (thereinafter V0749 Aur) is conducted for the first time. Its orbital period is improved from P = 0.409873 to 0.409890 d in this work. The photometric data from the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) were utilized to examine the revised orbital period. Then, the phased multi-filter light curves were computed with the new period, and analyzed with the Wilson-Devinney (W-D) code. The results reveal that V0749 Aur is a marginal contact binary with a large temperature difference of about ΔT = 1600 K. It is a poor thermal contact binary, the light curves of which depart from EW-type and show EB-type light variations. Thus, V0749 Aur belongs to a particular group of binaries, named B-type binaries, predicted by the Thermal Relaxation Oscillation (TRO) theory. In addition, the amplitude differences in different bands of the light curves, imply the existence of a third light. The contribution of the third light detected by the light curve analysis is consistent with the contribution of a visual star, which is in the same line of sight as V0749 Aur but at a different distance. With its marginal contact and short period properties, V0749 Aur merits further attention as a potential transitional sample in binary evolution.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASJ...74.1421C
PNV J00444033+4113068: Early superhumps with 0.7 mag amplitude and non-red color;;In the first days of WZ Sge-type dwarf nova (DN) outbursts, the 2 : 1 resonance induces a spiral arm structure in the accretion disk, which is observed as early superhumps in optical light curves. We reports on our optical observations of an eclipsing WZ Sge-type DN PNV J00444033+4113068 during its 2021 superoutburst using the 3.8 m Seimei telescope and through the Variable Star Network collaboration. The eclipse analysis showed that its orbital period was 0.055425534(1) d. Our observations confirmed early superhumps with an amplitude of 0.7 mag, the largest amplitude among known WZ Sge-type DNe. More interestingly, its early superhumps became the reddest around their secondary minimum, whereas other WZ Sge-type DNe show the reddest color around the early superhump maximum. The spectrum around the peak of the outburst showed two double-peaked emission lines of He II 4686 Å and Hα with a peak separation of ≥700 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, supporting a very high-inclination system. With the early superhump mapping, the unique profile and color of the early superhump are successfully reproduced by an accretion disk with a vertically extended double arm structure. Therefore, a large amplitude and a unique color behavior of the early superhumps in PNV J00444033+4113068 can be explained by the 2 : 1 resonance model along with other WZ Sge-type DNe.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASJ...74.1287T
Challenges for ΛCDM: An update;;A number of challenges to the standard ΛCDM model have been emerging during the past few years as the accuracy of cosmological observations improves. In this review we discuss in a unified manner many existing signals in cosmological and astrophysical data that appear to be in some tension (2 σ or larger) with the standard ΛCDM model as specified by the Cosmological Principle, General Relativity and the Planck18 parameter values. In addition to the well-studied 5 σ challenge of ΛCDM (the Hubble H<SUB>0</SUB> tension) and other well known tensions (the growth tension, and the lensing amplitude A<SUB>L</SUB> anomaly), we discuss a wide range of other less discussed less-standard signals which appear at a lower statistical significance level than the H<SUB>0</SUB> tension some of them known as 'curiosities' in the data) which may also constitute hints towards new physics. For example such signals include cosmic dipoles (the fine structure constant α, velocity and quasar dipoles), CMB asymmetries, BAO Ly α tension, age of the Universe issues, the Lithium problem, small scale curiosities like the core-cusp and missing satellite problems, quasars Hubble diagram, oscillating short range gravity signals etc. The goal of this pedagogical review is to collectively present the current status (2022 update) of these signals and their level of significance, with emphasis on the Hubble tension and refer to recent resources where more details can be found for each signal. We also briefly discuss theoretical approaches that can potentially explain some of these signals.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022NewAR..9501659P
A very luminous jet from the disruption of a star by a massive black hole;;Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are bursts of electromagnetic energy that are released when supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies violently disrupt a star that passes too close<SUP>1</SUP>. TDEs provide a window through which to study accretion onto supermassive black holes; in some rare cases, this accretion leads to launching of a relativistic jet<SUP>2-9</SUP>, but the necessary conditions are not fully understood. The best-studied jetted TDE so far is Swift J1644+57, which was discovered in γ-rays, but was too obscured by dust to be seen at optical wavelengths. Here we report the optical detection of AT2022cmc, a rapidly fading source at cosmological distance (redshift z = 1.19325) the unique light curve of which transitioned into a luminous plateau within days. Observations of a bright counterpart at other wavelengths, including X-ray, submillimetre and radio, supports the interpretation of AT2022cmc as a jetted TDE containing a synchrotron `afterglow', probably launched by a supermassive black hole with spin greater than approximately 0.3. Using four years of Zwicky Transient Facility<SUP>10</SUP> survey data, we calculate a rate of 0.0 2<SUB>−0.01</SUB><SUP>+0.04</SUP> Gpc<SUP>−3</SUP> yr<SUP>−1</SUP> for on-axis jetted TDEs on the basis of the luminous, fast-fading red component, thus providing a measurement complementary to the rates derived from X-ray and radio observations<SUP>11</SUP>. Correcting for the beaming angle effects, this rate confirms that approximately 1 per cent of TDEs have relativistic jets. Optical surveys can use AT2022cmc as a prototype to unveil a population of jetted TDEs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Natur.612..430A
A nearby long gamma-ray burst from a merger of compact objects;;Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are flashes of high-energy radiation arising from energetic cosmic explosions. Bursts of long (greater than two seconds) duration are produced by the core-collapse of massive stars<SUP>1</SUP>, and those of short (less than two seconds) duration by the merger of compact objects, such as two neutron stars<SUP>2</SUP>. A third class of events with hybrid high-energy properties was identified<SUP>3</SUP>, but never conclusively linked to a stellar progenitor. The lack of bright supernovae rules out typical core-collapse explosions<SUP>4-6</SUP>, but their distance scales prevent sensitive searches for direct signatures of a progenitor system. Only tentative evidence for a kilonova has been presented<SUP>7,8</SUP>. Here we report observations of the exceptionally bright GRB 211211A, which classify it as a hybrid event and constrain its distance scale to only 346 megaparsecs. Our measurements indicate that its lower-energy (from ultraviolet to near-infrared) counterpart is powered by a luminous (approximately 10<SUP>42</SUP> erg per second) kilonova possibly formed in the ejecta of a compact object merger.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Natur.612..228T
A fast-rising tidal disruption event from a candidate intermediate-mass black hole;;Massive black holes (BHs) at the centres of massive galaxies are ubiquitous. The population of BHs within dwarf galaxies, on the other hand, is not yet known. Dwarf galaxies are thought to harbour BHs with proportionally small masses, including intermediate-mass BHs, with masses 10<SUP>2</SUP> < M<SUB>BH</SUB> < 10<SUP>6</SUP> solar masses (M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). Identification of these systems has historically relied on the detection of light emitted from accreting gaseous disks close to the BHs. Without this light, they are difficult to detect. Tidal disruption events, the luminous flares produced when a star strays close to a BH and is shredded, are a direct way to probe massive BHs. The rise times of these flares theoretically correlate with the BH mass. Here we present AT 2020neh, a fast-rising tidal disruption event candidate, hosted by a dwarf galaxy. AT 2020neh can be described by the tidal disruption of a main sequence star by a 10<SUP>4.7</SUP>-10<SUP>5.9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> BH. We find the observable rate of fast-rising nuclear transients like AT 2020neh to be low, at ≲2 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> events Mpc<SUP>−3</SUP> yr<SUP>−1</SUP>. Finding non-accreting BHs in dwarf galaxies is important to determine how prevalent BHs are within these galaxies, and to constrain models of BH formation. AT 2020neh-like events may provide a galaxy-independent method of measuring the masses of intermediate-mass BHs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022NatAs...6.1452A
Pan-chromatic photometric classification of supernovae from multiple surveys and transfer learning for future surveys;;Time-domain astronomy is entering a new era as wide-field surveys with higher cadences allow for more discoveries than ever before. The field has seen an increased use of machine learning and deep learning for automated classification of transients into established taxonomies. Training such classifiers requires a large enough and representative training set, which is not guaranteed for new future surveys such as the Vera Rubin Observatory, especially at the beginning of operations. We present the use of Gaussian processes to create a uniform representation of supernova light curves from multiple surveys, obtained through the Open Supernova Catalog for supervised classification with convolutional neural networks. We also investigate the use of transfer learning to classify light curves from the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) dataset. Using convolutional neural networks to classify the Gaussian process generated representation of supernova light curves from multiple surveys, we achieve an AUC score of 0.859 for classification into Type Ia, Ibc, and II. We find that transfer learning improves the classification accuracy for the most under-represented classes by up to 18 per cent when classifying PLAsTiCC light curves, and is able to achieve an AUC score of 0.946 ± 0.001 when including photometric redshifts for classification into six classes (Ia, Iax, Ia-91bg, Ibc, II, SLSN-I). We also investigate the usefulness of transfer learning when there is a limited labelled training set to see how this approach can be used for training classifiers in future surveys at the beginning of operations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.tmp.3485B
The orbital evolution of Atira asteroids;;Asteroids having perihelion distance q < 1.3 AU are classified as near-Earth objects (NEOs), which are divided into different sub-groups: Vatira-class, Atira-class, Aten-class, Apollo-class, and Amor-class. 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB>, the first Vatira (Orbiting totally inside Venus' orbit) was discovered by the Twilight project of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) on 2020 January 4. Upon the discovery of 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB>, a couple of orbital studies of the short-term orbital evolution of 2020 AV<SUB>2</SUB> have been performed and published (e.g. de la Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente Marcos 2020; Greenstreet 2020). In this work, we performed an assessment of the long-term orbital evolution of known near-Earth objects and known Atiras under the Yarkovsky effect by using the Mercury6 N-body code. We considered not only planetary gravitational perturbation but also the non-gravitational Yarkovsky effect. Our calculation shows that the NEOs have generally two dynamical populations, one short-lived and the other long-lived. From our calculation, the transfer probabilities of Atira-class asteroids to Vatira-class asteroids for the first transition are ~13.1 ± 0.400, ~13.05 ± 0.005, and ~13.25 ± 0.450 ${{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ for different values of the Yarkovsky force (i.e. obliquity of 0, 90, and 180 deg), respectively. It suggests that the radiation force may play some role in the long-term evolution of this asteroid population. Finally, our statistical study implicates that there should be 8.14 ± 0.133 Atira-class asteroids and 1.05 ± 0.075 Vatira-asteroids of the S-type taxonomy.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.5921L
Optical studies of a bright Type Iax supernova SN 2020rea;;We present optical photometric and spectroscopic analysis of a Type Iax supernova (SN) 2020rea situated at the brighter luminosity end of Type Iax supernovae (SNe). The light curve decline rate of SN 2020rea is Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(g) = 1.31 ± 0.08 mag which is similar to SNe 2012Z and 2005hk. Modelling the pseudo-bolometric light curve with a radiation diffusion model yields a mass of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni of 0.13 ± 0.01 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and an ejecta mass of 0.77$^{+0.11}_{-0.21}$ M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Spectral features of SN 2020rea during the photospheric phase show good resemblance with SN 2012Z. TARDIS modelling of the early spectra of SN 2020rea reveals a dominance of Iron Group Elements (IGEs). The photospheric velocity of the Si II line around maximum for SN 2020rea is ~ 6500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> which is less than the measured velocity of the Fe II line and indicates significant mixing. The observed physical properties of SN 2020rea match with the predictions of pure deflagration model of a Chandrasekhar mass C-O white dwarf. The metallicity of the host galaxy around the SN region is 12 + log(O/H) = 8.56 ± 0.18 dex which is similar to that of SN 2012Z.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.5617S
The lure of sirens: joint distance and velocity measurements with third-generation detectors;;The next generation of detectors will detect gravitational waves from binary neutron stars at cosmological distances, for which around a 1000 electromagnetic follow-ups may be observed per year. So far, most work devoted to the expected cosmological impact of these standard sirens employed them only as distance indicators. Only recently their use as tracers of clustering, similar to what already proposed for supernovae, has been studied. Focusing on the expected specifications of the Einstein Telescope (ET), we forecast here the performance on cosmological parameters of future standard sirens as both distance and density indicators, with emphasis on the linear perturbation growth index and on spatial curvature. We improve upon previous studies in a number of ways: a more detailed analysis of available telescope time, the inclusion of more cosmological and nuisance parameters, the Alcock-Paczynski correction, the use of sirens also as both velocity and density tracers, and a more accurate estimation of the distance posterior. We find that the analysis of the clustering of sirens improves the constraints on H<SUB>0</SUB> by 30 per cent and on Ω<SUB>k0</SUB> by over an order of magnitude, with respect to their use merely as distance indicators. With 5 yr of joint ET and Rubin Observatory follow-ups we could reach precision of 0.1 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> in H<SUB>0</SUB> and 0.02 in Ω<SUB>k0</SUB> using only data in the range 0 < z < 0.5. We also find that the use of sirens as tracers of density, and not only velocity, yields good improvements on the growth of structure constraints.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.5449A
Magnetic braking saturates: evidence from the orbital period distribution of low-mass detached eclipsing binaries from ZTF;;We constrain the orbital period (P<SUB>orb</SUB>) distribution of low-mass detached main-sequence eclipsing binaries (EBs) with light-curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which provides a well-understood selection function and sensitivity to faint stars. At short periods (P<SUB>orb</SUB> ≲ 2 d), binaries are predicted to evolve significantly due to magnetic braking (MB), which shrinks orbits and ultimately brings detached binaries into contact. The period distribution is thus a sensitive probe of MB. We find that the intrinsic period distribution of low-mass (0.1 ≲ M<SUB>1</SUB>/M<SUB>⊙</SUB> < 0.9) binaries is basically flat (${\rm d}N/{\rm d}P_{\rm orb} \propto P_{\rm orb}^0$) from P<SUB>orb</SUB> = 10 d down to the contact limit. This is strongly inconsistent with predictions of classical MB models based on the Skumanich relation, which are widely used in binary evolution calculations and predict ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}P_{\rm orb} \propto P_{\rm orb}^{7/3}$ at short periods. The observed distributions are best reproduced by models in which the magnetic field saturates at short periods with a MB torque that scales roughly as $\dot{J}\propto P_{\rm orb}^{-1}$, as opposed to $\dot{J} \propto P_{\rm orb}^{-3}$ in the standard Skumanich law. We also find no significant difference between the period distributions of binaries containing fully and partially convective stars. Our results confirm that a saturated MB law, which was previously found to describe the spin-down of rapidly rotating isolated M dwarfs, also operates in tidally locked binaries. We advocate using saturated MB models in binary evolution calculations. Our work supports previous suggestions that MB in cataclysmic variables (CVs) is much weaker than assumed in the standard evolutionary model, unless mass transfer leads to significant additional angular momentum loss in CVs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.4916E
SN 2019ein: a Type Ia supernova likely originated from a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosion;;We present extensive optical photometric and spectroscopic observations for the nearby Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2019ein, spanning the phases from ~3 to ~330 d after the explosion. This SN Ia is characterized by extremely fast expansion at early times, with initial velocities of Si II and Ca II being above ~25 000-30 000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. After experiencing an unusually rapid velocity decay, the ejecta velocity dropped to ~13 000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> around maximum light. Photometrically, SN 2019ein has a moderate post-peak decline rate (Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(B) = 1.35 ± 0.01 mag), while being fainter than normal SNe Ia by about 40 per cent (with $M^{\rm max}_{B} \approx -18.71 \pm 0.15$ mag). The nickel mass synthesized in the explosion is estimated to be 0.27-0.31 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> from the bolometric light curve. Given such a low nickel mass and a relatively high photospheric velocity, we propose that SN 2019ein likely had a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (WD) progenitor, M<SUB>WD</SUB> ≲ 1.22 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. In this case, the explosion could have been triggered by a double-detonation mechanism, for which 1D and 2D models with WD mass M<SUB>WD</SUB> ≈ 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a helium shell of 0.01 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> can reasonably produce the observed bolometric light curve and spectra. The predicted asymmetry as a result of double detonation is also favoured by the redshifted Fe II and Ni II lines observed in the nebular-phase spectrum. Possible diversity in origin of high velocity SNe Ia is also discussed.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.4098X
The nova KT Eri Is a recurrent nova with a recurrence time-scale of 40-50 yr;;KT Eridani was a very fast nova in 2009 peaking at V = 5.42 mag. We marshal large data sets of photometry to finally work out the nature of KT Eri. From the TESS light curve, as confirmed with our radial velocity curve, we find an orbital period of 2.61595 d. With our 272 spectral energy distributions from simultaneous BVRIJHK measures, the companion star has a temperature of 6200 ± 500 K. Our century-long average in quiescence has V = 14.5. With the Gaia distance (5110$^{+920}_{-430}$ pc), the absolute magnitude is $M_{V_q}$ = +0.7 ± 0.3. We converted this absolute magnitude (corrected to the disc light alone) to accretion rates, $\dot{M}$, with a full integration of the α-disc model. This $\dot{M}$ is very high at 3.5 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Our search and analysis of archival photographs shows that no eruption occurred from 1928 to 1954 or after 1969. With our analysis of the optical light curve, the X-ray light curve, and the radial velocity curve, we derive a white dwarf mass of 1.25 ± 0.03 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. With the high white dwarf mass and very-high $\dot{M}$, KT Eri must require a short time to accumulate the required mass to trigger the next nova event. Our detailed calculations give a recurrence time-scale of 12 yr with a total range of 5-50 yr. When combined with the archival constraints, we conclude that the recurrence time-scale must be between 40 and 50 yr. So, KT Eri is certainly a recurrent nova, with the prior eruption remaining undiscovered in a solar gap of coverage from 1959 to 1969.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.3864S
Comprehensive listing of 156 reliable orbital periods for novae, including 49 new periods;;I report on a large-scale search for the orbital periods (P) of most known nova systems, by looking for significant, coherent, and stable optical photometric modulation in two or more independent light curves taken mostly from the large surveys of TESS, Kepler, AAVSO, SMARTS, OGLE, ASAS, and ZTF. I have discovered 31 new orbital periods. Further, I have measured new periods for 18 novae with evolved companions, to 30 per cent accuracy, as based on their spectral energy distribution. Also, I have confirmed, improved, and rejected prior claims for P in 46 novae. (As part of this effort, I recognize that 5 novae display 1-3 coherent, significant, and transient periodicities 0.12-4.1 d, with these being mysterious as not being the orbital, spin, or superhump periods). In all, I have compiled a comprehensive list of 156 reliable P values for novae. The histogram of nova periods shows a minimum P at 0.059 h (85 min), and a Period Gap from 0.071 to 0.111 d (1.70-2.66 h). The upper edge of the Period Gap is significantly different between novae (0.111 d), nova-like systems (0.131 d), and dwarf novae (0.141 d). A further issue from the histogram is that 31 per cent of nova systems have evolved companions, for which there has been no models or understanding for their current state or evolution. For the novae with red giant companions, 15-out-of-20 are in the bulge population, despite novae with main-sequence and subgiant companions having bulge fractions near 0.11-0.32.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.3640S
Constraints on the Galactic Centre environment from Gaia hypervelocity stars II: The evolved population;;A dynamical encounter between a stellar binary and Sgr A* in the Galactic Centre (GC) can tidally separate the binary and eject one member with a velocity beyond the escape speed of the Milky Way. These hypervelocity stars (HVSs) can offer insight into the stellar populations in the GC environment. In a previous work, our simulations showed that the lack of main sequence HVS candidates with precise astrometric uncertainties and radial velocities in current data releases from the Gaia space mission places a robust upper limit on the ejection rate of HVSs from the GC of $3\times 10^{-2} \, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. We improve this constraint in this work by additionally considering the absence of post-main sequence HVSs in Gaia Early Data Release 3 as well as the existence of the HVS candidate S5-HVS1. This evidence offers degenerate joint constraints on the HVS ejection rate and the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in the GC. For a top-heavy GC IMF as suggested by recent works, our modelling motivates an HVS ejection rate of $\eta =0.7_{-0.5}^{+1.5} \times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. This preferred ejection rate can be as large as $10^{-2} \, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ for a very top-light IMF and as low as 10$^{-4.5} \, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ if the IMF is extremely top-heavy. Constraints will improve further with future Gaia data releases, regardless of how many HVS candidates are found therewithin.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.3469E
Machine learning-based search for cataclysmic variables within Gaia Science Alerts;;Wide-field time domain facilities detect transient events in large numbers through difference imaging. For example, Zwicky Transient Facility produces alerts for hundreds of thousands of transient events per night, a rate set to be dwarfed by the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory. The automation provided by machine learning (ML) is therefore necessary to classify these events and select the most interesting sources for follow-up observations. Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are a transient class that are numerous, bright, and nearby, providing excellent laboratories for the study of accretion and binary evolution. Here we focus on our use of ML to identify CVs from photometric data of transient sources published by the Gaia Science Alerts (GSA) program - a large, easily accessible resource, not fully explored with ML. Use of light-curve feature extraction techniques and source metadata from the Gaia survey resulted in a random forest model capable of distinguishing CVs from supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and young stellar objects with a 92 per cent precision score and an 85 per cent hit rate. Of 13 280 sources within GSA without an assigned transient classification our model predicts the CV class for ~2800. Spectroscopic observations are underway to classify a statistically significant sample of these targets to validate the performance of the model. This work puts us on a path towards the classification of rare CV subtypes from future wide-field surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.3362M
Radio observations of the Black Hole X-ray Binary EXO 1846-031 re-awakening from a 34-year slumber;;We present radio [1.3 GHz MeerKAT, 4-8 GHz Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), and 15.5 GHz Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA)] and X-ray (Swift and MAXI) data from the 2019 outburst of the candidate Black Hole X-ray Binary (BHXB) EXO 1846-031. We compute a Hardness-Intensity diagram, which shows the characteristic q-shaped hysteresis of BHXBs in outburst. EXO 1846-031 was monitored weekly with MeerKAT and approximately daily with AMI-LA. The VLA observations provide sub-arcsecond-resolution images at key points in the outburst, showing moving radio components. The radio and X-ray light curves broadly follow each other, showing a peak on ~MJD 58702, followed by a short decline before a second peak between ~MJD 58731-58739. We estimate the minimum energy of these radio flares from equipartition, calculating values of E<SUB>min</SUB> ~ 4 × 10<SUP>41</SUP> and 5 × 10<SUP>42</SUP> erg, respectively. The exact date of the return to 'quiescence' is missed in the X-ray and radio observations, but we suggest that it likely occurred between MJD 58887 and 58905. From the Swift X-ray flux on MJD 58905 and assuming the soft-to-hard transition happened at 0.3-3 per cent Eddington, we calculate a distance range of 2.4-7.5 kpc. We computed the radio:X-ray plane for EXO 1846-031 in the 'hard' state, showing that it is most likely a 'radio-quiet' BH, preferentially at 4.5 kpc. Using this distance and a jet inclination angle of θ = 73°, the VLA data place limits on the intrinsic jet speed of β<SUB>int</SUB> = 0.29c, indicating subluminal jet motion.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.2801W
Star-spots and magnetism: testing the activity paradigm in the Pleiades and M67;;We measure star-spot filling fractions for 240 stars in the Pleiades and M67 open star clusters using APOGEE high-resolution H-band spectra. For this work, we developed a modified spectroscopic pipeline which solves for star-spot filling fraction and star-spot temperature contrast. We exclude binary stars, finding that the large majority of binaries in these clusters (80 per cent) can be identified from Gaia DR3 and APOGEE criteria - important for field star applications. Our data agree well with independent activity proxies, indicating that this technique recovers real star-spot signals. In the Pleiades, filling fractions saturate at a mean level of 0.248 ± 0.005 for active stars with a decline at slower rotation; we present fitting functions as a function of Rossby number. In M67, we recover low mean filling fractions of 0.030 ± 0.008 and 0.003 ± 0.002 for main sequence GK stars and evolved red giants, respectively, confirming that the technique does not produce spurious spot signals in inactive stars. Star-spots also modify the derived spectroscopic effective temperatures and convective overturn time-scales. Effective temperatures for active stars are offset from inactive ones by -109 ± 11 K, in agreement with the Pecaut & Mamajek empirical scale. Star-spot filling fractions at the level measured in active stars changes their inferred overturn time-scale, which biases the derived threshold for saturation. Finally, we identify a population of stars statistically discrepant from mean activity-Rossby relations and present evidence that these are genuine departures from a Rossby scaling. Our technique is applicable to the full APOGEE catalogue, with broad applications to stellar, galactic, and exoplanetary astrophysics.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.2165C
SN 2020wnt: a slow-evolving carbon-rich superluminous supernova with no O II lines and a bumpy light curve;;We present the analysis of SN 2020wnt, an unusual hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I), at a redshift of 0.032. The light curves of SN 2020wnt are characterized by an early bump lasting ~5 d, followed by a bright main peak. The SN reaches a peak absolute magnitude of M$_{r}^{\rm max}=-20.52\pm 0.03$ mag at ~77.5 d from explosion. This magnitude is at the lower end of the luminosity distribution of SLSNe-I, but the rise-time is one of the longest reported to date. Unlike other SLSNe-I, the spectra of SN 2020wnt do not show O II, but strong lines of C II and Si II are detected. Spectroscopically, SN 2020wnt resembles the Type Ic SN 2007gr, but its evolution is significantly slower. Comparing the bolometric light curve to hydrodynamical models, we find that SN 2020wnt luminosity can be explained by radioactive powering. The progenitor of SN 2020wnt is likely a massive and extended star with a pre-SN mass of 80 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a pre-SN radius of 15 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> that experiences a very energetic explosion of 45 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg, producing 4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni. In this framework, the first peak results from a post-shock cooling phase for an extended progenitor, and the luminous main peak is due to a large nickel production. These characteristics are compatible with the pair-instability SN scenario. We note, however, that a significant contribution of interaction with circumstellar material cannot be ruled out.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.2056G
Searching for the next Galactic Luminous red nova;;Luminous red novae (LRNe) are astrophysical transients believed to be caused by the partial ejection of a binary star's common envelope (CE) and the merger of its components. The formation of the CE is likely to occur during unstable mass transfer, initiated by a primary star which is evolving off the main sequence (a Hertzsprung gap star) and a lower mass companion. In agreement with observations, theoretical studies have shown that outflows from the pre-CE phase produce a detectable brightening of the progenitor system a few years before the ejection event. Based on these assumptions, we present a method to identify Galactic LRNe precursors, the resulting precursor candidates, and our follow-up analysis to uncover their nature. We begin by constructing a sample of progenitor systems, i.e. Hertzsprung gap stars, by statistically modelling the density of a colour magnitude diagram formed from 'well behaved' Gaia DR2 sources. Their time-domain evolution from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey is used to search for slowly brightening events, as pre-CE precursor candidates. The nature of the resulting candidates is further investigated using archival data and our own spectroscopic follow-up. Overall, we constructed a sample of ~5.4 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> progenitor sources, from which 21 were identified as candidate LRNe precursors. Further analysis revealed 16 of our candidates to be Hα emitters, with their spectra often suggesting hotter (albeit moderately extincted) A-type or B-type stars. Because of their long-term variability in optical and mid-infrared wavelengths, we propose that many of our candidates are mass-transferring binaries with compact companions surrounded by dusty circumstellar discs or alternatively magnetically active stellar merger remnants.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517.1884A
Unveiling the Universe with emerging cosmological probes;;The detection of the accelerated expansion of the Universe has been one of the major breakthroughs in modern cosmology. Several cosmological probes (Cosmic Microwave Background, Supernovae Type Ia, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations) have been studied in depth to better understand the nature of the mechanism driving this acceleration, and they are being currently pushed to their limits, obtaining remarkable constraints that allowed us to shape the standard cosmological model. In parallel to that, however, the percent precision achieved has recently revealed apparent tensions between measurements obtained from different methods. These are either indicating some unaccounted systematic effects, or are pointing toward new physics. Following the development of CMB, SNe, and BAO cosmology, it is critical to extend our selection of cosmological probes. Novel probes can be exploited to validate results, control or mitigate systematic effects, and, most importantly, to increase the accuracy and robustness of our results. This review is meant to provide a state-of-art benchmark of the latest advances in emerging "beyond-standard" cosmological probes. We present how several different methods can become a key resource for observational cosmology. In particular, we review cosmic chronometers, quasars, gamma-ray bursts, standard sirens, lensing time-delay with galaxies and clusters, cosmic voids, neutral hydrogen intensity mapping, surface brightness fluctuations, stellar ages of the oldest objects, secular redshift drift, and clustering of standard candles. The review describes the method, systematics, and results of each probe in a homogeneous way, giving the reader a clear picture of the available innovative methods that have been introduced in recent years and how to apply them. The review also discusses the potential synergies and complementarities between the various probes, exploring how they will contribute to the future of modern cosmology.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022LRR....25....6M
Electromagnetic counterparts to massive black-hole mergers;;The next two decades are expected to open the door to the first coincident detections of electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational-wave (GW) signatures associated with massive black-hole (MBH) binaries heading for coalescence. These detections will launch a new era of multimessenger astrophysics by expanding this growing field to the low-frequency GW regime and will provide an unprecedented understanding of the evolution of MBHs and galaxies. They will also constitute fundamentally new probes of cosmology and would enable unique tests of gravity. The aim of this Living Review is to provide an introduction to this research topic by presenting a summary of key findings, physical processes and ideas pertaining to EM counterparts to MBH mergers as they are known at the time of this writing. We review current observational evidence for close MBH binaries, discuss relevant physical processes and timescales, and summarize the possible EM counterparts to GWs in the precursor, coalescence, and afterglow stages of a MBH merger. We also describe open questions and discuss future prospects in this dynamic and quick-paced research area.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022LRR....25....3B
Gravitational waves and electromagnetic transients;;The advanced gravitational wave (GW) detector network has started routine detection of signals from merging compact binaries. Data indicate that in a fair fraction of these sources, at least one component was a neutron star, bringing with it the possibility of electromagnetic (EM) radiation. So far, a confirmed link between EM and GW radiation has been established for only one source, GW170817. Joint analysis of broadband multi-wavelength data and the GW signal have yielded rich information spanning fields as varied as jet physics, cosmology and nucleosynthesis. Here, we discuss the importance of such joint observations, as well as current and near-future efforts to discover and study more EM counterparts to GW sources.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JApA...43...53S
Analysis of dual band and survey photometry of two low mass ratio contact binary systems;;The study presents photometric analysis of the completely eclipsing contact binary systems TYC 8351-1081-1 and ASAS J210406-0522.3. TYC 8351-1081-1 is an extremely low mass ratio (q =0.086 ) system with a high degree of contact (f =0.66 ) while ASAS J210406-0522.3 is found to be in marginal contact (f =0.08 ) with a relatively low-mass ratio of 0.272. There is good thermal contact in both systems with only a small difference in the temperature of the components. The systems have been observed by a number sky surveys over the past 20 years. We compare the light curve solutions from up to three of these surveys and find that survey photometric data manually analysed is robust and yields results comparable to dedicated ground-based photometry. There is evidence of significant luminosity transfer from the primary to the secondary, on the order of 0.5 L<SUB>⊙</SUB> for TYC 8351-1081-1 and 0.06 L<SUB>⊙</SUB> for ASAS J210406-0522.3. There appears to be no change in the period of either system over the past 20 years and theoretical angular momentum loss is below current measurement threshold in both cases. We also show that the mass ratio and separation are well above the theoretical values for orbital instability in both cases. As would be expected, the density of the secondary components is significantly higher relative to the primary.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JApA...43...42W
Optimization of artificial neural networks models applied to the identification of images of asteroids' resonant arguments;;The asteroidal main belt is crossed by a web of mean motion and secular resonances that occur when there is a commensurability between fundamental frequencies of the asteroids and planets. Traditionally, these objects were identified by visual inspection of the time evolution of their resonant argument, which is a combination of orbital elements of the asteroid and the perturbing planet(s). Since the population of asteroids affected by these resonances is, in some cases, of the order of several thousand, this has become a taxing task for a human observer. Recent works used convolutional neural network (CNN) models to perform such task automatically. In this work, we compare the outcome of such models with those of some of the most advanced and publicly available CNN architectures, like the VGG, Inception, and ResNet. The performance of such models is first tested and optimized for overfitting issues, using validation sets and a series of regularization techniques like data augmentation, dropout, and batch normalization. The three best-performing models were then used to predict the labels of larger testing databases containing thousands of images. The VGG model, with and without regularizations, proved to be the most efficient method to predict labels of large datasets. Since the Vera C. Rubin observatory is likely to discover up to four million new asteroids in the next few years, the use of these models might become quite valuable to identify populations of resonant minor bodies.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022CeMDA.134...59C
Search for Tidal Disruption Events Based on the SRG/eROSITA Survey with Subsequent Optical Spectroscopy;;The four completed six-month sky surveys with the eROSITA telescope onboard the SRG orbital observatory allow tidal disruption events (TDEs) in galactic nuclei to be searched for by their X-ray variability. In this case, variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are detected in much larger quantities, for the elimination of which fairly stringent criteria have to be used. Some TDEs can be missed or misclassified as probable AGNs. Optical spectroscopy needs to be performed for the final identification of TDEs among the extragalactic SRG/eROSITA transients. We consider a set of criteria by which TDEs can be distinguished from AGNs based on optical spectra and photometric information. In particular, we propose to use the ratio of the X-ray luminosity to the [O III] 5007 Å luminosity. To test the proposed method, we consider a sample of 15 extragalactic SRG/eROSITA transients whose X-ray flux changed by more than a factor of 7 between two adjacent surveys. Spectra have been taken for all these objects with Russian optical telescopes: RTT-150, AZT-33IK, RC2500, and BTA. We have managed to reveal five new and one previously known TDEs and to classify seven sources as AGNs. The nature of two more transients remains in question. The proposed method will help to set priorities to obtain a maximally complete and reliable sample of TDEs in the SRG/eROSITA survey.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AstL...48..767K
Highly Variable Active Galactic Nuclei in the SRG/eROSITA Sky Survey: I. The Constriction of a Sample and the Catalog of Objects Detected in a Low State;;We present the results of our search for highly variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs) the X-ray flux from which changed by more than an order of magnitude during the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey. Using the eROSITA data obtained in the period from December 2019 to February 2022, we have found 1325 sources the X-ray flux from which in the 0.3-2.3 keV energy band changed by more than a factor of 10 at a confidence level of at least 99.73${%}$. Of them, 635 objects have been classified as AGNs or AGN candidates. We describe the procedure of searching for highly variable sources and the selection of extragalactic objects among them and describe the statistical properties of the produced catalog. We provide a catalog of 49 sources for which a statistically significant flux in their low state was detected. For the latter we provide their light curves and X-ray spectra and discuss in detail the most interesting of them.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AstL...48..735M
Magnetic Fields of Chemically Peculiar and Related Stars. VIII. Main Results of 2021 and Near-Future Prospects;;—We present a review of the papers written in the research field of stellar magnetism in 2021. The instruments, observation, and data analysis methods, photometry, spectroscopy, and spectropolarimetry results are considered. We present new data on magnetic fields of chemically peculiar stars and other objects of various types.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AstBu..77..437R
Late-time H/He-poor Circumstellar Interaction in the Type Ic Supernova SN 2021ocs: An Exposed Oxygen-Magnesium Layer and Extreme Stripping of the Progenitor;;Supernova (SN) 2021ocs was discovered in the galaxy NGC 7828 (z = 0.01911) within the interacting system Arp 144 and subsequently classified as a normal Type Ic SN around peak brightness. Very Large Telescope/FORS2 observations in the nebular phase at 148 days reveal that the spectrum is dominated by oxygen and magnesium emission lines of different transitions and ionization states: O I, [O I], [O II], [O III], Mg I, and Mg II. Such a spectrum has no counterpart in the literature, though it bears a few features similar to those of some interacting Type Ibn and Icn SNe. Additionally, SN 2021ocs showed a blue color, (g - r) ≲ -0.5 mag, after the peak and up to late phases, atypical for a Type Ic SN. Together with the nebular spectrum, this suggests that SN 2021ocs underwent late-time interaction with an H/He-poor circumstellar medium (CSM) resulting from the pre-SN progenitor mass loss during its final ~1000 days. The strong O and Mg lines and the absence of strong C and He lines suggest that the progenitor star's O-Mg layer is exposed, which places SN 2021ocs as the most extreme case of a massive progenitor star's envelope stripping in interacting SNe, followed by Type Icn (stripped C-O layer) and Ibn (stripped He-rich layer) SNe. This is the first time such a case is reported in the literature. The SN 2021ocs emphasizes the importance of late-time spectroscopy of SNe, even for those classified as normal events, to reveal the inner ejecta and progenitor star's CSM and mass loss. *Based on observations collected at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere under ESO program 108.2282.001.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...941L..32K
Forecasting the Detection Capabilities of Third-generation Gravitational-wave Detectors Using GWFAST;;We introduce GWFAST, a novel Fisher-matrix code for gravitational-wave studies, tuned toward third-generation gravitational-wave detectors such as Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). We use it to perform a comprehensive study of the capabilities of ET alone, and of a network made by ET and two CE detectors, as well as to provide forecasts for the forthcoming O4 run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration. We consider binary neutron stars, binary black holes, and neutron star-black hole binaries, and compute basic metrics such as the distribution of signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), the accuracy in the reconstruction of various parameters (including distance, sky localization, masses, spins, and, for neutron stars, tidal deformabilities), and the redshift distribution of the detections for different thresholds in S/N and different levels of accuracy in localization and distance measurement. We examine the expected distribution and properties of golden events, with especially large values of the S/N. We also pay special attention to the dependence of the results on astrophysical uncertainties and on various technical details (such as choice of waveforms, or the threshold in S/N), and we compare with other Fisher codes in the literature. In the companion paper Iacovelli et al., we discuss the technical aspects of the code. Together with this paper, we publicly release the code GWFAST, (https://github.com/CosmoStatGW/gwfast) and the library WF4Py (https://github.com/CosmoStatGW/WF4Py) implementing state-of-the-art gravitational-wave waveforms in pure Python.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...941..208I
A New Flaring Black Widow Candidate and Demographics of Black Widow Millisecond Pulsars in the Galactic Field;;We present the discovery of a new optical/X-ray source likely associated with the Fermi γ-ray source 4FGL J1408.6-2917. Its high-amplitude periodic optical variability, large spectroscopic radial-velocity semiamplitude, evidence for optical emission lines and flaring, and X-ray properties together imply the source is probably a new black widow millisecond pulsar binary. We compile the properties of the 41 confirmed and suspected field black widows, finding a median secondary mass of 0.027 ± 0.003 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Considered jointly with the more massive redback millisecond pulsar binaries, we find that the "spider" companion mass distribution remains strongly bimodal, with essentially zero systems having companion masses of between ~0.07 and 0.1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. X-ray emission from black widows is typically softer and less luminous than in redbacks, consistent with less efficient particle acceleration in the intrabinary shock in black widows, excepting a few systems that appear to have more efficient "redback-like" shocks. Together black widows and redbacks dominate the census of the fastest spinning field millisecond pulsars in binaries with known companion types, making up ≳80% of systems with P <SUB>spin</SUB> < 2 ms. Similar to redbacks, the neutron star masses in black widows appear on average significantly larger than the canonical 1.4 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, and many of the highest-mass neutron stars claimed to date are black widows with M <SUB>NS</SUB> ≳ 2.1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Both of these observations are consistent with an evolutionary picture where spider millisecond pulsars emerge from short orbital period progenitors that had a lengthy period of mass transfer initiated while the companion was on the main sequence, leading to fast spins and high masses.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...941..199S
Photometric and Spectroscopic Study of the EXor-like Eruptive Young Star Gaia19fct;;Gaia19fct is one of the Gaia-alerted eruptive young stars that has undergone several brightening events. We conducted monitoring observations using multifilter optical and near-infrared photometry, as well as near-infrared spectroscopy, to understand the physical properties of Gaia19fct and investigate whether it fits into the historically defined two classes. We present the analyses of light curves, color variations, spectral lines, and CO modeling. The light curves show at least five brightening events since 2015, and the multifilter color evolutions are mostly gray. The gray evolution indicates that bursts are triggered by mechanisms other than extinction. Our near-infrared spectra exhibit both absorption and emission lines and show time variability throughout our observations. We found lower rotational velocity and lower temperature from the near-infrared atomic absorption lines than from the optical lines, suggesting that Gaia19fct has a Keplerian rotating disk. The CO overtone features show a superposition of absorption and emission components, which is unlike other young stellar objects. We modeled the CO lines, and the result suggests that the emission and absorption components are formed in different regions. We found that although Gaia19fct exhibits characteristics of both types of eruptive young stars, FU Orionis-type objects and EX Lupi-type objects, it shows more similarity with EXors in general.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...941..165P
The Impact of Initial-Final Mass Relations on Black Hole Microlensing;;Uncertainty in the initial-final mass relation (IFMR) has long been a problem in understanding the final stages of massive star evolution. One of the major challenges of constraining the IFMR is the difficulty of measuring the mass of nonluminous remnant objects (i.e., neutron stars and black holes). Gravitational-wave detectors have opened the possibility of finding large numbers of compact objects in other galaxies, but all in merging binary systems. Gravitational lensing experiments using astrometry and photometry are capable of finding compact objects, both isolated and in binaries, in the Milky Way. In this work we improve the Population Synthesis for Compact object Lensing Events (PopSyCLE) microlensing simulation code in order to explore the possibility of constraining the IFMR using the Milky Way microlensing population. We predict that the Roman Space Telescope's microlensing survey will likely be able to distinguish different IFMRs based on the differences at the long end of the Einstein crossing time distribution and the small end of the microlensing parallax distribution, assuming the small (π <SUB> E </SUB> ≲ 0.02) microlensing parallaxes characteristic of black hole lenses are able to be measured accurately. We emphasize that future microlensing surveys need to be capable of characterizing events with small microlensing parallaxes in order to place the most meaningful constraints on the IFMR.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...941..116R
Luminous Supernovae: Unveiling a Population between Superluminous and Normal Core-collapse Supernovae;;Stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae can be divided into two broad classes: the common Type Ib/c supernovae (SNe Ib/c), powered by the radioactive decay of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni, and the rare superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), most likely powered by the spin-down of a magnetar central engine. Up to now, the intermediate regime between these two populations has remained mostly unexplored. Here, we present a comprehensive study of 40 luminous supernovae (LSNe), SNe with peak magnitudes of M <SUB> r </SUB> = -19 to -20 mag, bound by SLSNe on the bright end and by SNe Ib/c on the dim end. Spectroscopically, LSNe appear to form a continuum between Type Ic SNe and SLSNe. Given their intermediate nature, we model the light curves of all LSNe using a combined magnetar plus radioactive decay model and find that they are indeed intermediate, not only in terms of their peak luminosity and spectra, but also in their rise times, power sources, and physical parameters. We subclassify LSNe into distinct groups that are either as fast evolving as SNe Ib/c or as slow evolving as SLSNe, and appear to be either radioactively or magnetar powered, respectively. Our findings indicate that LSNe are powered by either an overabundant production of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni or by weak magnetar engines, and may serve as the missing link between the two populations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...941..107G
Classifying Unidentified X-Ray Sources in the Chandra Source Catalog Using a Multiwavelength Machine-learning Approach;;The rapid increase in serendipitous X-ray source detections requires the development of novel approaches to efficiently explore the nature of X-ray sources. If even a fraction of these sources could be reliably classified, it would enable population studies for various astrophysical source types on a much larger scale than currently possible. Classification of large numbers of sources from multiple classes characterized by multiple properties (features) must be done automatically and supervised machine learning (ML) seems to provide the only feasible approach. We perform classification of Chandra Source Catalog version 2.0 (CSCv2) sources to explore the potential of the ML approach and identify various biases, limitations, and bottlenecks that present themselves in these kinds of studies. We establish the framework and present a flexible and expandable Python pipeline, which can be used and improved by others. We also release the training data set of 2941 X-ray sources with confidently established classes. In addition to providing probabilistic classifications of 66,369 CSCv2 sources (21% of the entire CSCv2 catalog), we perform several narrower-focused case studies (high-mass X-ray binary candidates and X-ray sources within the extent of the H.E.S.S. TeV sources) to demonstrate some possible applications of our ML approach. We also discuss future possible modifications of the presented pipeline, which are expected to lead to substantial improvements in classification confidences.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...941..104Y
The Double White Dwarf Merger Progenitors of SDSS J2211+1136 and ZTF J1901+1458;;Double white dwarf (DWD) mergers are possibly the leading formation channel of massive, rapidly rotating, high-field magnetic white dwarfs (HFMWDs). However, a direct link connecting a DWD merger to any observed HFMWD is still missing. We here show that the HFMWDs SDSS J221141.80+113604.4 (hereafter J2211+1136) and ZTF J190132.9+145808.7 (hereafter J1901+1458) might be DWD merger products. J2211+1136 is a 1.27 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> white dwarf (WD) with a rotation period of 70.32 s and a surface magnetic field of 15 MG. J1901+1458 is a 1.327-1.365 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> WD with a rotation period of 416.20 s, and a surface magnetic field in the range 600-900 MG. With the assumption of single-star evolution and the currently measured WD masses and surface temperatures, the cooling ages of J2211+1136 and J1901+1458 are, respectively, 2.61-2.85 Gyr and 10-100 Myr. We hypothesize that these WDs are DWD merger products and compute the evolution of the postmerged configuration formed by a central WD surrounded by a disk. We show that the postmerger system evolves through three phases depending on whether accretion, mass ejection (propeller), or magnetic braking dominates the torque onto the central WD. We calculate the time the WD spends in each of these phases and obtain the accretion rate and disk mass for which the WD rotational age, i.e., the total time elapsed since the merger to the instant where the WD central remnant reaches the current measured rotation period, agrees with the estimated WD cooling age. We infer the mass values of the primary and secondary WD components of the DWD merger that lead to a postmerger evolution consistent with the observations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...941...28S
The Periodic Signals of Nova V1674 Herculis (2021);;We present time-series photometry during the early decline phase of the extremely fast nova V1674 Herculis. The 2021 light curve showed periodic signals at 0.152921(3) days and 501.486(5) s, which we interpret as respectively the orbital and white dwarf spin periods in the underlying binary. We also detected a sideband signal at the difference frequency between these two clocks. During the first 15 days of outburst, the spin period appears to have increased by 0.014(1)%. This increase probably arose from the sudden loss of high-angular-momentum gas ("the nova explosion") from the rotating, magnetic white dwarf. Both periodic signals appeared remarkably early in the outburst, which we attribute to the extreme speed with which the nova evolved (and became transparent to radiation from the inner binary). After that very fast initial period increase of 71 ms, the period subsequently decreased-at 182(18) ms yr<SUP>-1</SUP> in 2021, and 88(18) ms yr<SUP>-1</SUP> in 2022. These rates are ~100× faster than typically seen in intermediate polars. This could be due to high accretion torques from very high mass-transfer rates, which might be common when low-mass donor stars are strongly irradiated by a nova outburst.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940L..56P
Interacting Kilonovae: Long-lasting Electromagnetic Counterparts to Binary Mergers in the Accretion Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei;;We investigate the dynamics and electromagnetic (EM) signatures of neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) or neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) merger ejecta that occur in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We find that the interaction between ejecta and disk gas leads to important effects on the dynamics and radiation. We show five stages of the ejecta dynamics: gravitational slowing down, coasting, Sedov-Taylor deceleration in the disk, reacceleration after the breakout from the disk surface, and momentum-conserved snowplow phase. Meanwhile, the radiation from the ejecta is so bright that its typical peak luminosity reaches a few times 10<SUP>43</SUP>-10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Since most of the radiation energy has converted from the kinetic energy of merger ejecta, we call such an explosive phenomenon an interacting kilonova (IKN). It should be emphasized that IKNe are very promising, bright EM counterparts to NS-NS/BH-NS merger events in AGN disks. The bright peak luminosity and long rising time (i.e., 10 to 20 days in UV bands, 30 to 50 days in optical bands, and 100 days to hundreds of days in IR bands) allow most survey telescopes to have ample time to detect an IKN. However, the peak brightness, peak time, and evolution pattern of the light curve of an IKN are similar to a superluminous supernova in a galactic nucleus and a tidal disruption event making it difficult to distinguish between them. But it also suggests that IKNe might have been present in recorded AGN transients.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940L..44R
Discovery of One Neutron Star Candidate from Radial-velocity Monitoring;;We report the discovery of one possible neutron star binary (P <SUB>orb</SUB> = 0.8666 days) by using LAMOST low-resolution spectroscopic data. The visible companion is a late A-type dwarf (T <SUB>eff</SUB> = 7900 ± 200 K; logg = 4.3 ± 0.2; M = 1.7 ± 0.1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>; R = 1.7 ± 0.2 R <SUB>⊙</SUB>) at a distance of 1.11 ± 0.03 kpc. No double-lined feature can be seen from the Gran Telescopio Canarias/HORuS high-resolution spectra; thus the radial-velocity variation indicates an invisible object hiding in the binary. The system's optical light curves show clear ellipsoidal variability, suggesting that the visible companion is tidal distorted. By fitting the multiband light curves with the eclipsing light-curve (ELC) code and the Wilson-Devinney (WD) code, we constrain the mass of the invisible star to be 1.1-1.3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Spectral disentangling shows no additional component with optical absorption spectra, supporting the idea that the system contains one compact object. No X-ray or UV emission is detected in the ROSAT archive observations. Therefore, we suspect the invisible object is more likely a neutron star rather than a white dwarf. Our finding suggests the ability of LAMOST spectroscopic survey to discover X-ray-quiescent compact objects.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940..165Y
Contracting and Expanding Binary Black Holes in 3D Low-mass AGN Disks: The Importance of Separation;;LIGO/Virgo has detected several binary black hole (BBH) merger events that may have originated in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). These events require individual black hole masses that fall within the pair instability supernova mass gap, and therefore these black holes may have been grown from hierarchical mergers. AGN disks are a prime environment for hierarchical mergers and thus a potential location for the progenitors of BBH gravitational wave events. Understanding how a BBH embedded in an AGN disk interacts with the surrounding environment is thus crucial for determining whether this interaction can lead to its merger. However, there are few high-fidelity simulations of this process, and almost all are two-dimensional. We present the results from 3D, high-resolution, local shearing-box simulations of an embedded BBH interacting with an AGN disk. In these first simulations of their kind, we focus on determining the mass accretion rate and the orbital evolution rate at different BBH separations. We find that circular, equal-mass BBHs with separations greater than 10% of their Hill radius contract while accreting at a super-Eddington rate. At smaller separations, however, our 3D simulations find that BBHs expand their orbits. This result suggests that it may be difficult for an AGN disk to push a BBH to merger, but we discuss several mechanisms, including MHD turbulence and radiative and mechanical feedback, which could alleviate this difficulty.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940..155D
Deep Generative Modeling of Periodic Variable Stars Using Physical Parameters;;The ability to generate physically plausible ensembles of variable sources is critical to the optimization of time domain survey cadences and the training of classification models on data sets with few to no labels. Traditional data augmentation techniques expand training sets by reenvisioning observed exemplars, seeking to simulate observations of specific training sources under different (exogenous) conditions. Unlike fully theory-driven models, these approaches do not typically allow principled interpolation nor extrapolation. Moreover, the principal drawback of theory-driven models lies in the prohibitive computational cost of simulating source observables from ab initio parameters. In this work, we propose a computationally tractable machine learning approach to generate realistic light curves of periodic variables capable of integrating physical parameters and variability classes as inputs. Our deep generative model, inspired by the transparent latent space generative adversarial networks, uses a variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture with temporal convolutional network layers, trained using the OGLE-III optical light curves and physical characteristics (e.g., effective temperature and absolute magnitude) from Gaia DR2. A test using the temperature-shape relationship of RR Lyrae demonstrates the efficacy of our generative "physics-enhanced latent space VAE" (PELS-VAE) model. Such deep generative models, serving as nonlinear nonparametric emulators, present a novel tool for astronomers to create synthetic time series over arbitrary cadences.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..263M
Bridging the Gap-The Disappearance of the Intermediate Period Gap for Fully Convective Stars, Uncovered by New ZTF Rotation Periods;;The intermediate period gap, discovered by Kepler, is an observed dearth of stellar rotation periods in the temperature-period diagram at ~20 days for G dwarfs and up to ~30 days for early-M dwarfs. However, because Kepler mainly targeted solar-like stars, there is a lack of measured periods for M dwarfs, especially those at the fully convective limit. Therefore it is unclear if the intermediate period gap exists for mid- to late-M dwarfs. Here, we present a period catalog containing 40,553 rotation periods (9535 periods >10 days), measured using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). To measure these periods, we developed a simple pipeline that improves directly on the ZTF archival light curves and reduces the photometric scatter by 26%, on average. This new catalog spans a range of stellar temperatures that connect samples from Kepler with MEarth, a ground-based time-domain survey of bright M dwarfs, and reveals that the intermediate period gap closes at the theoretically predicted location of the fully convective boundary (G <SUB>BP</SUB> - G <SUB>RP</SUB> ~ 2.45 mag). This result supports the hypothesis that the gap is caused by core-envelope interactions. Using gyro-kinematic ages, we also find a potential rapid spin-down of stars across this period gap.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..251L
Magnetic Interactions in Orbital Dynamics;;The magnetic field of a host star can impact the orbit of a stellar partner, planet, or asteroid if the orbiting body is itself magnetic or electrically conducting. Here, we focus on the instantaneous magnetic forces on an orbiting body in the limit where the dipole approximation describes its magnetic properties as well as those of its stellar host. A permanent magnet in orbit about a star will be inexorably drawn toward the stellar host if the magnetic force is comparable to gravity due to the steep radial dependence of the dipole-dipole interaction. While magnetic fields in observed systems are much too weak to drive a merger event, we confirm that they may be high enough in some close compact binaries to cause measurable orbital precession. When the orbiting body is a conductor, the stellar field induces a time-varying magnetic dipole moment that leads to the possibility of eccentricity pumping and resonance trapping. The challenge is that the orbiter must be close to the stellar host, so that magnetic interactions must compete with tidal forces and the effects of intense stellar radiation.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..229B
Strong lensing time-delay cosmography in the 2020s;;Multiply imaged time-variable sources can be used to measure absolute distances as a function of redshifts and thus determine cosmological parameters, chiefly the Hubble Constant H<SUB>0</SUB>. In the two decades up to 2020, through a number of observational and conceptual breakthroughs, this so-called time-delay cosmography has reached a precision sufficient to be an important independent voice in the current "Hubble tension" debate between early- and late-universe determinations of H<SUB>0</SUB>. The 2020s promise to deliver major advances in time-delay cosmography, owing to the large number of lenses to be discovered by new and upcoming surveys and the vastly improved capabilities for follow-up and analysis. In this review, after a brief summary of the foundations of the method and recent advances, we outline the opportunities for the decade and the challenges that will need to be overcome in order to meet the goal of the determination of H<SUB>0</SUB> from time-delay cosmography with 1% precision and accuracy.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&ARv..30....8T
Shell helium-burning hot subdwarf B stars as candidates for blue large-amplitude pulsators;;Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) are a newly discovered type of variable star. Their typical pulsation periods are on the order of a few tens of minutes, with relatively large amplitudes of 0.2-0.4 mag in optical bands, and their rates of period changes are on the order of 10<SUP>−7</SUP> yr<SUP>−1</SUP> (both positive and negative). They are extremely rare objects and attempts to explain their origins and internal structures have attracted a great deal of attention. Previous studies have proposed that BLAPs may be pre-white dwarfs, with masses around 0.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, or core-helium-burning stars in the range of ∼0.7 − 1.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. In this work, we use a number of MESA models to compute and explore whether BLAPs could be explained as shell helium-burning subdwarfs type B (SHeB sdBs). The models that best match existing observational constraints have helium core masses in the range of ∼0.45 − 0.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Our model predicts that the positive rate of period change may evolve to negative. The formation channels for SHeB sdBs involve binary evolution and although the vast majority of BLAPs do not appear to be binaries (with the exception of HD 133729), the observational constraints are still very poor. Motivated by these findings, we explored the Roche lobe overflow channel. Of the 304 binary evolution models we computed, about half of them are able to produce SHeB sdBs in long-period binaries that evade detection from the limited observations that are currently available.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...668A.112X
Examining the dust of the tailless Oort-cloud comet C/2020 T2;;We report our latest analysis of the Oort-cloud comet C/2020 T2 (also named Palomar or T2) observed at 2.06 au from the Sun (phase angle of 28.°5) roughly two weeks before perihelion. It lacks a significant dust tail in scattered light, showing a strong central condensation of the coma throughout the apparition that is reminiscent of so-called Manx comets. Its spectral slope of polarized light increases and decreases in the J (1.25 μm) and H (1.65 μm) bands, respectively, resulting in an overall negative (blue) slope (−0.31 ±0.14% μm<SUP>−1</SUP> ) in contrast to the red polarimetric color of active comets observed at similar geometries. The average polarization degree of T2 is 2.86±0.17% for the J and 2.75±0.16% for the H bands. Given that near-infrared wavelengths are sensitive to the intermediate-scale structure of cometary dust (i.e., dust aggregates), our light-scattering modeling of ballistic aggregates with different porosities and compositions shows that the polarimetric properties of T2 are compatible with low-porosity (~66%), absorbing dust aggregates with negligible ice contents on a scale of 10-100 μm (density of ~652 kg m<SUP>−3</SUP>). This is supported by the coma morphology of T2 which has a viable β (the relative importance of solar radiation pressure on dust particles) range of ≲10<SUP>−4</SUP>. The secular evolution of r-band activity of T2 from archival data reveals that the increase in its brightness accelerates around 2.4 au pre-perihelion, with its overall dust production rate that is about 100 times smaller than those of active Oort-cloud comets. We also found an apparent concentration of T2 and Manx comets toward ecliptic orbits. This paper underlines the heterogeneous nature of Oort-cloud comets, which may be investigated in the near future with dedicated studies of their dust characteristics.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...668A..97K
He-star donor AM CVn stars and their progenitors as LISA sources;;Context. Ultracompact cataclysmic variables (CVs) of the AM CVn type are deemed to be important verification sources for the future space gravitational wave detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). 
 Aims: We model the present-day Galactic population of AM CVn stars with He-star donors. Such a population has long expected to exist, though only a couple of candidates are known. 
 Methods: We applied the hybrid method of binary population synthesis (BPS) which combines a simulation of the population of immediate precursors of AM CVn stars by a fast BPS code with subsequent tracking of their evolution by a full evolutionary code. 
 Results: The model predicts that the present birthrate of He-donor AM CVn stars in the Galaxy is 4.6 × 10<SUP>−4</SUP> yr<SUP>−1</SUP> and the Galaxy may harbour ≃112 000 objects of this class which have orbital periods P ≲ 42 − 43 min. The foreground confusion limit and instrumental noise of LISA prevent the discovery of longer periods systems in gravitational waves. We find that about 500 He-star AM CVns may be detected by LISA with signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) > 5 during a 4 yr mission. Within 1 Kpc from the Sun, there may exist up to 130 He-star AM CVns with the periods in the same range, which may serve as verification binaries, if detected in the electromagnetic spectrum. In the Milky Way, there are also ≃14 800 immediate precursors of AM CVn stars. They are detached systems with a stripped low-mass He-star and a white dwarf companion, out of which about 75 may potentially be observed by LISA during its mission.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...668A..80L
Structure and evolution of ultra-massive white dwarfs in general relativity;;Context. Ultra-massive white dwarfs (M<SUB>⋆</SUB> ≳ 1.05 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) are of utmost importance in view of the role they play in type Ia supernovae explosions, merger events, the existence of high-magnetic -field white dwarfs, and the physical processes in the super asymptotic giant branch phase. 
 Aims: We aim to present the first set of constant rest-mass ultra-massive oxygen-neon white dwarf cooling tracks with masses of M<SUB>⋆</SUB> > 1.29 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> which fully take into account the effects of general relativity on their structural and evolutionary properties. 
 Methods: We computed the full evolution sequences of 1.29, 1.31, 1.33, 1.35, and 1.369 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> white dwarfs with the La Plata stellar evolution code, LPCODE. For this work, the standard equations of stellar structure and evolution have been modified to include the effects of general relativity. Specifically, the fully general relativistic partial differential equations governing the evolution of a spherically symmetric star are solved in a way so that they resemble the standard Newtonian equations of stellar structure. For comparison purposes, the same sequences have been computed for the Newtonian case. 
 Results: According to our calculations, the evolutionary properties of the most massive white dwarfs are strongly modified by general relativity effects. In particular, the resulting stellar radius is markedly smaller in the general relativistic case, being up to 25% smaller than predicted by the Newtonian treatment for the more massive ones. We find that oxygen-neon white dwarfs more massive than 1.369 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> become gravitationally unstable with respect to general relativity effects. When core chemical distribution due to phase separation on crystallization is considered, such instability occurs at somewhat lower stellar masses, ≳1.36 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. In addition, cooling times for the most massive white dwarf sequences are about a factor of two smaller than in the Newtonian case at advanced stages of evolution. Finally, a sample of white dwarfs have been identified as ideal candidates to test these general relativistic effects. 
 Conclusions: We conclude that the general relativity effects should be taken into account for an accurate assessment of the structural and evolutionary properties of the most massive white dwarfs. These new ultra-massive white dwarf models constitute a considerable improvement over those computed in the framework of the standard Newtonian theory of stellar interiors.

HyperGal: Hyperspectral scene modeling for supernova typing with the SED Machine integral field spectrograph;;Context. Recent developments in time domain astronomy, such as Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), have made it possible to conduct daily scans of the entire visible sky, leading to the discovery of hundreds of new transients every night. Among these detections, 10 to 15 of these objects are supernovae (SNe), which have to be classified prior to cosmological use. The spectral energy distribution machine (SEDM) is a low-resolution (ℛ ~ 100) integral field spectrograph designed, built, and operated with the aim of spectroscopically observing and classifying targets detected by the ZTF main camera. 
 Aims: As the current PYSEDM pipeline can only handle isolated point sources, it is limited by contamination when the transient is too close to its host galaxy core. This can lead to an incorrect typing and ultimately bias the cosmological analyses, affecting the homogeneity of the SN sample in terms of local environment properties. We present a new scene modeler to extract the transient spectrum from its structured background, with the aim of improving the typing efficiency of the SEDM. 
 Methods: HYPERGAL is a fully chromatic scene modeler that uses archival pre-transient photometric images of the SN environment to generate a hyperspectral model of the host galaxy. It is based on the CIGALE SED fitter used as a physically-motivated spectral interpolator. The galaxy model, complemented by a point source for the transient and a diffuse background component, is projected onto the SEDM spectro-spatial observation space and adjusted to observations, and the SN spectrum is ultimately extracted from this multi-component model. The full procedure, from scene modeling to transient spectrum extraction and typing, is validated on 5000 simulated cubes built from actual SEDM observations of isolated host galaxies, covering a broad range of observing conditions and scene parameters. 
 Results: We introduce the contrast, c, as the transient-to-total flux ratio at the SN location, integrated over the ZTF r-band. From estimated contrast distribution of real SEDm observations, we show that HYPERGAL correctly classifies ~95% of SNe Ia, and up to 99% for contrast c ≳ 0.2, representing more than 90% of the observations. Compared to the standard point-source extraction method (without the hyperspectral galaxy modeling step), HYPERGAL correctly classifies 20% more SNe Ia between 0.1 < c < 0.6 (50% of the observation conditions), with less than 5% of SN Ia misidentifications. The false-positive rate is less than 2% for c > 0.1 (> 99% of the observations), which represents half as much as the standard extraction method. Assuming a similar contrast distribution for core-collapse SNe, HYPERGAL classifies 14% additional SNe II and 11% additional SNe Ibc. 
 Conclusions: HYPERGAL has proven to be extremely effective in extracting and classifying SNe in the presence of strong contamination by the host galaxy, providing a significant improvement with respect to the single point-source extraction.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...668A..43L
Tracing the Milky Way warp and spiral arms with classical Cepheids;;Context. Mapping the Galactic spiral structure is a difficult task since the Sun is located in the Galactic plane and because of dust extinction. For these reasons, molecular masers in radio wavelengths have been used with great success to trace the Milky Way spiral arms. Recently, Gaia parallaxes have helped in investigating the spiral structure in the Solar extended neighborhood. 
 Aims: In this paper, we propose to determine the location of the spiral arms using Cepheids since they are bright, young supergiants with accurate distances (they are the first ladder of the extragalactic distance scale). They can be observed at very large distances; therefore, we need to take the Galactic warp into account. 
 Methods: Thanks to updated mid-infrared photometry and to the most complete catalog of Galactic Cepheids, we derived the parameters of the warp using a robust regression method. Using a clustering algorithm, we identified groups of Cepheids after having corrected their Galactocentric distances from the (small) effects of the warp. 
 Results: We derived new parameters for the Galactic warp, and we show that the warp cannot be responsible for the increased dispersion of abundance gradients in the outer disk reported in previous studies. We show that Cepheids can be used to trace spiral arms, even at large distances from the Sun. The groups we identify are consistent with previous studies explicitly deriving the position of spiral arms using young tracers (masers, OB(A) stars) or mapping overdensities of upper main-sequence stars in the Solar neighborhood thanks to Gaia data.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...668A..40L
Open clusters housing classical Cepheids in Gaia DR3;;The latest Gaia Data Release 3 provides an opportunity to expand the census of Galactic open clusters harboring classical Cepheid variables, thereby bolstering the cosmic distance scale. A comprehensive analysis yielded a total of 50 classical Cepheids associated with 45 open clusters, of which 39 open cluster-classical Cepheid pairs are considered probable, with the remaining 11 pairs considered improbable but worth following up. Two previously identified clusters by us possibly host classical Cepheids (OC-0125/V1788 Cyg and OC-0675/OGLE-BLG-CEP-114). In addition, we identify 38 new open cluster candidates within the Galactic disk.

Premerger localization of intermediate mass binary black holes with LISA and prospects of joint observations with Athena and LSST;;The planned Laser Interferometric Space Antenna (LISA) will be able to detect gravitational waves (GWs) from intermediate mass binary black holes (IMBBHs) in the mass range ∼10<SUP>2</SUP>- 10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> up to a redshift z ∼20 . Modulation effects due to LISA's orbital motion around the Sun facilitate precise premerger localization of the sources, which in turn would help in electromagnetic (EM) followups. In this work, we calculate the uncertainties in sky position, luminosity distance, and time of coalescence as a function of time to coalescence. For representative masses of the IMBBHs, we synthesize a population of binaries uniformly located and oriented on a sphere of radius 3 Gpc and compute the projected parameter measurement uncertainties using the Fisher information matrix. We find that for systems with a total mass of 10<SUP>3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, the errors in the sky position and luminosity distance are ∼0.4 deg<SUP>2</SUP> and ∼6 %, respectively, one day prior to coalescence. The coalescence time can be predicted with an uncertainty ≲10 sec , one day before coalescence. We also find that for 10<SUP>3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, around 40% (100%) of the population has a source localization that is smaller than the field of view of Athena (LSST) one day before the merger. These extremely precise measurements can be used to alert ground-based GW detectors and EM telescopes about the time and location of these mergers. We also discuss mechanisms that may produce EM emission from IMBBH mergers and study its detectability using the planned Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) in the optical and Athena in the x-ray bands. Detection of an EM transient may provide us vital clues about the environments where these mergers occur and the distance estimation can pave the way for cosmography.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PhRvD.106j4015S
A New Period Determination Method for Periodic Variable Stars;;Variable stars play a key role in understanding the Milky Way and the universe. The era of astronomical big data presents new challenges for quick identification of interesting and important variable stars. Accurately estimating the periods is the most important step to distinguish different types of variable stars. Here, we propose a new method of determining the variability periods. By combining the statistical parameters of the light curves, the colors of the variables, the window function and the Generalized Lomb-Scargle (GLS) algorithm, the aperiodic variables are excluded and the periodic variables are divided into eclipsing binaries and NEB variables (other types of periodic variable stars other than eclipsing binaries), the periods of the two main types of variables are derived. We construct a random forest classifier based on 241,154 periodic variables from the ASAS-SN and OGLE data sets of variables. The random forest classifier is trained on 17 features, among which 11 are extracted from the light curves and 6 are from the Gaia Early DR3, ALLWISE, and 2MASS catalogs. The variables are classified into 7 superclasses and 17 subclasses. In comparison with the ASAS-SN and OGLE catalogs, the classification accuracy is generally above approximately 82% and the period accuracy is 70%-99%. To further test the reliability of the new method and classifier, we compare our results with the results of Chen et al. for ZTF DR2. The classification accuracy is generally above 70%. The period accuracy of the EW and SR variables is ~50% and 53%, respectively. And the period accuracy of other types of variables is 65%-98%.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134k4507X
Shock cooling of a red-supergiant supernova at redshift 3 in lensed images;;The core-collapse supernova of a massive star rapidly brightens when a shock, produced following the collapse of its core, reaches the stellar surface. As the shock-heated star subsequently expands and cools, its early-time light curve should have a simple dependence on the size of the progenitor<SUP>1</SUP> and therefore final evolutionary state. Measurements of the radius of the progenitor from early light curves exist for only a small sample of nearby supernovae<SUP>2-14</SUP>, and almost all lack constraining ultraviolet observations within a day of explosion. The several-day time delays and magnifying ability of galaxy-scale gravitational lenses, however, should provide a powerful tool for measuring the early light curves of distant supernovae, and thereby studying massive stellar populations at high redshift. Here we analyse individual rest-frame exposures in the ultraviolet to the optical taken with the Hubble Space Telescope, which simultaneously capture, in three separate gravitationally lensed images, the early phases of a supernova at redshift z ≈ 3 beginning within 5.8 ± 3.1 hours of explosion. The supernova, seen at a lookback time of approximately 11.5 billion years, is strongly lensed by an early-type galaxy in the Abell 370 cluster. We constrain the pre-explosion radius to be 53 3<SUB>−119</SUB><SUP>+154</SUP> solar radii, consistent with a red supergiant. Highly confined and massive circumstellar material at the same radius can also reproduce the light curve, but because no similar low-redshift examples are known, this is unlikely.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Natur.611..256C
High-energy neutrino transients and the future of multi-messenger astronomy;;The discovery of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos and the first hints of coincident electromagnetic and neutrino emissions opened new opportunities in multi-messenger astronomy. Owing to their high power, transient sources are expected to supply a significant fraction of the observed energetic astroparticles, through enhanced particle acceleration and interactions. Here, we review theoretical expectations of neutrino emission from transient astrophysical sources and the current and upcoming experimental landscape, highlighting the most promising channels for discovery and specifying their detectability.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022NatRP...4..697G
Investigation of a likely orbital periodicity of Nova Hercules 2021 in X-rays and γ-rays;;We report a detection of a ~0.153 d period in the classical nova V1674 Her using the NICER observations taken within a month since the outburst (i.e. ~MJD 59405). The X-ray period is consistent with the orbital period previously found in the optical band, strongly suggesting the NICER signal as the X-ray orbital periodicity of the system. A seemingly double-humped profile was obtained by folding the detrended X-ray light curve with the period after removing the rotational X-ray pulsations of the nova. The profile may be caused by occultation by the companion or the accretion disc, possibly indicating a high inclination of the system. The γ-ray emission of V1674 Her with a significance level ≳ 5 σ was detected by Fermi-LAT close to its optical peak and the emission faded away within 1 d, which is the shortest duration known for a γ-ray nova. Folded on 0.153 d, a marginal γ-ray variability can be also seen in the LAT light curve, but without the double-hump feature observed in X-rays. If the γ-ray modulation is real, its origin is probably different from that observed in the X-ray and optical bands.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517L..97L
Modelling the flare in NGC 1097 from 1991 to 2004 as a tidal disruption event;;In the letter, interesting evidence is reported to support a central tidal disruption event (TDE) in the known AGN NGC 1097. Considering the motivations of TDE as one probable origination of emission materials of double-peaked broad emission lines and also as one probable explanation to changing-look AGN, it is interesting to check whether there are clues to support a TDE in NGC 1097, not only a changing-look AGN but also an AGN with double-peaked broad emission lines. Under the assumption that the onset of broad Hα emission was due to a TDE, the 13 yr-long (1991-2004) variability of double-peaked broad Hα line flux in NGC 1097 can be well predicted by theoretical TDE model, with a (1 - 1.5) M<SUB>⊙</SUB> main-sequence star tidally disrupted by the central BH with TDE model determined mass about (5 - 8) × 10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The results provide interesting evidence to not only support TDE-related origin of double-peaked broad line emission materials but also support TDE as an accepted physical explanation to physical properties of changing-look AGN.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517L..71Z
The discovery and characterization of (594913) 'Ayló'chaxnim, a kilometre sized asteroid inside the orbit of Venus;;Near-Earth asteroid population models predict the existence of bodies located inside the orbit of Venus. Despite searches up to the end of 2019, none had been found. We report discovery and follow-up observations of (594913) 'Ayló'chaxnim, an asteroid with an orbit entirely interior to Venus. (594913) 'Ayló'chaxnim has an aphelion distance of ~0.65 au, is ~2 km in diameter and is red in colour. The detection of such a large asteroid inside the orbit of Venus is surprising given their rarity according to near-Earth asteroid population models. As the first officially numbered and named asteroid located entirely within the orbit of Venus, we propose that the class of interior to Venus asteroids be referred to as 'Ayló'chaxnim asteroids.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517L..49B
Real-time detection of anomalies in large-scale transient surveys;;New time-domain surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, will observe millions of transient alerts each night, making standard approaches of visually identifying new and interesting transients infeasible. We present two novel methods of automatically detecting anomalous transient light curves in real-time. Both methods are based on the simple idea that if the light curves from a known population of transients can be accurately modelled, any deviations from model predictions are likely anomalies. The first modelling approach is a probabilistic neural network built using Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) and the second is an interpretable Bayesian parametric model of a transient. We demonstrate our methods' ability to provide anomaly scores as a function of time on light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We show that the flexibility of neural networks, the attribute that makes them such a powerful tool for many regression tasks, is what makes them less suitable for anomaly detection when compared with our parametric model. The parametric model is able to identify anomalies with respect to common supernova classes with high precision and recall scores, achieving area under the precision-recall curves above 0.79 for most rare classes such as kilonovae, tidal disruption events, intermediate luminosity transients, and pair-instability supernovae. Our ability to identify anomalies improves over the lifetime of the light curves. Our framework, used in conjunction with transient classifiers, will enable fast and prioritized followup of unusual transients from new large-scale surveys.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.517..393M
The 'Giraffe': discovery of a stripped red giant in an interacting binary with an 2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> lower giant;;We report the discovery of a stripped giant + lower giant Algol-type binary, 2M04123153+6738486 (2M0412), identified during a search for non-interacting compact object - star binaries. 2M0412 is an evolved (T<SUB>eff, giant</SUB> ≃ 4000 K), luminous (L<SUB>giant</SUB> ≃ 150 L<SUB>⊙</SUB>) red giant in a circular P = 81.2 d binary. 2M0412 is a known variable star previously classified as a semiregular variable. The cross-correlation functions of follow-up Keck/HIRES and LBT/Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI) spectra show an radial velocity variable second component with implied mass ratio q = M<SUB>giant</SUB>/M<SUB>comp</SUB> ≃ 0.20 ± 0.01. The All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN), Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), Transiting Exoplanet Survey Telescope ( TESS), and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) light curves show that the giant is a Roche lobe filling ellipsoidal variable with an inclination of 49.4 ± 0.3°, and a giant mass of M<SUB>giant</SUB> = 0.38 ± 0.01 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> for a distance of ≃ 3.7 kpc. The mass of the giant indicates that its envelope has been partially stripped. The giant companion on the lower red giant branch has a mass of M<SUB>comp</SUB> = 1.91 ± 0.03 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> with T<SUB>eff, comp</SUB> ≃ 5000 K, L<SUB>comp</SUB> ≃ 60 L<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and R<SUB>comp</SUB> ≃ 11 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The lower giant contributes ${\sim }35{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the flux in the V band. We also identify an orbital phase dependent, broad $\rm H\,\alpha$ emission line which could indicate ongoing accretion from the stripped red giant on to the companion.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.5945J
The emergence of diffused gamma-ray burst afterglows from the discs of active galactic nuclei;;The discs of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have emerged as rich environments for the production and capture of stars and the compact objects that they leave behind. These stars produce long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at their deaths, while frequent interactions among compact objects form binary neutron stars and neutron star-black hole binaries, leading to short GRBs upon their merger. Predicting the properties of these transients as they emerge from the dense environments of AGN discs is key to their proper identification and to better constrain the star and compact object population in AGN discs. Some of these transients would appear unusual because they take place in much higher densities than the interstellar medium. Others, which are the subject of this paper, would additionally be modified by radiation diffusion, since they are generated within optically thick regions of the accretion discs. Here, we compute the GRB afterglow light curves for diffused GRB sources for a representative variety of central black hole masses and disc locations. We find that the radiation from radio to ultraviolet and soft X-rays can be strongly suppressed by synchrotron self-absorption in the dense medium of the AGN disc. In addition, photon diffusion can significantly delay the emergence of the emission peak, turning a beamed, fast transient into a slow, isotropic, and dimmer one. These would appear as broad-band correlated AGN variability with a dominance at the higher frequencies. Their properties can constrain both the stellar populations within AGN discs and the disc structure.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.5935W
Discovering faint and high apparent motion rate near-Earth asteroids using a deep learning program;;Although many near-Earth objects have been found by ground-based telescopes, some fast-moving ones, especially those near detection limits, have been missed by observatories. We developed a convolutional neural network for detecting faint fast-moving near-Earth objects. It was trained with artificial streaks generated from simulations and was able to find these asteroid streaks with an accuracy of 98.7 per cent and a false positive rate of 0.02 per cent on simulated data. This program was used to search image data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in four nights in 2019, and it identified six previously undiscovered asteroids. The visual magnitudes of our detections range from ~19.0 to 20.3 and motion rates range from ~6.8 to 24 deg d<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is very faint compared to other ZTF detections moving at similar motion rates. Our asteroids are also ~1-51 m diameter in size and ~5-60 lunar distances away at close approach, assuming their albedo values follow the albedo distribution function of known asteroids. The use of a purely simulated data set to train our model enables the program to gain sensitivity in detecting faint and fast-moving objects while still being able to recover nearly all discoveries made by previously designed neural networks which used real detections to train neural networks. Our approach can be adopted by any observatory for detecting fast-moving asteroid streaks.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.5785W
Orphan optical flare as SOSS emission afterglow, localization in time;;We report on MASTER optical observations of an afterglow-like optical and X-ray transient AT2021lfa/ZTF21aayokph. We detected the initial steady brightening of the transient at 7σ confidence level. This allowed us to use smooth optical self-similar emission of GRBs model to constrain the explosion time to better than 14 min as well as to estimate its initial Lorentz factor Γ<SUB>0</SUB> = 20 ± 10. Taking into consideration the low Γ<SUB>0</SUB> and non-detection in gamma-rays, we classify this transient as the first failed GRB afterglow.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.4980L
On the diversity of magnetar-driven kilonovae;;A non-negligible fraction of binary neutron star mergers are expected to form long-lived neutron star remnants, dramatically altering the multimessenger signatures of a merger. Here, we extend existing models for magnetar-driven kilonovae and explore the diversity of kilonovae and kilonova afterglows. Focusing on the role of the (uncertain) magnetic field strength, we study the resulting electromagnetic signatures as a function of the external dipolar and internal toroidal fields. These two parameters govern, respectively, the competition between magnetic-dipole spin-down and gravitational-wave spin-down (due to magnetic-field deformation) of the rapidly rotating remnant. We find that even in the parameter space where gravitational-wave emission is dominant, a kilonova with a magnetar central engine will be significantly brighter than one without an engine, as this parameter space is where more of the spin-down luminosity is thermalized. In contrast, a system with minimal gravitational-wave emission will produce a kilonova that may be difficult to distinguish from ordinary kilonovae unless early epoch observations are available. However, as the bulk of the energy in this parameter space goes into accelerating the ejecta, such a system will produce a brighter kilonova afterglow that will peak in shorter times. To effectively hide the presence of the magnetar from the kilonova and kilonova afterglow, the rotational energy inputted into the ejecta must be ≲10<SUP>-3</SUP>to 10<SUP>-2</SUP>E<SUB>rot</SUB>. We discuss the different diagnostics available to identify magnetar-driven kilonovae in serendipitous observations and draw parallels to other potential magnetar-driven explosions, such as superluminous supernovae and broad-line supernovae Ic.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.4949S
A detailed study of the barium central star of the planetary nebula Abell 70;;We present a detailed study of the barium star at the heart of the planetary nebula Abell 70. Time-series photometry obtained over a period of more than 10 yr demonstrates that the barium-contaminated companion is a rapid rotator with temporal variability due to spots. The amplitude and phasing of the photometric variability change abruptly; however, there is no evidence for a change in the rotation period (P = 2.06 d) over the course of the observations. The co-addition of 17 high-resolution spectra obtained with Ultraviolet and Visual Échelle Spectrograph mounted on the Very Large Telescope allows us to measure the physical and chemical properties of the companion, confirming it to be a chromospherically active, late G-type sub-giant with more than +1 dex of barium enhancement. We find no evidence of radial velocity variability in the spectra, obtained over the course of approximately 130 d with a single additional point some 8 yr later, with the radial velocities of all epochs approximately -10 km s <SUP>-1</SUP> from the previously measured systemic velocity of the nebula. This is perhaps indicative that the binary has a relatively long period (P ≳ 2 yr) and high eccentricity (e ≳ 0.3), and that all the observations were taken around radial velocity minimum. However, unless the binary orbital plane is not aligned with the waist of the nebula or the systemic velocity of the binary is not equal to the literature value for the nebula, this would imply an unfeasibly large mass for the nebular progenitor.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.4833J
Constraining R<SUB>V</SUB> variation using highly reddened Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ sample;;Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are powerful tools for measuring the expansion history of the Universe, but the impact of dust around SNe Ia remains unknown and is a critical systematic uncertainty. One way to improve our empirical description of dust is to analyse highly reddened SNe Ia [E(B - V) > 0.4, roughly equivalent to the fitted SALT2 light-curve parameter c > 0.3]. With the recently released Pantheon+ sample, there are 57 SNe Ia that were removed because of their high colour alone (with colours up to c = 1.61), which can provide enormous leverage on understanding line-of-sight R<SUB>V</SUB>. Previous studies have claimed that R<SUB>V</SUB> decreases with redder colour, though it is unclear if this is due to limited statistics, selection effects, or an alternative explanation. To test this claim, we fit two separate colour-luminosity relationships, one for the main cosmological sample (c < 0.3) and one for highly reddened (c > 0.3) SNe Ia. We find the change in the colour-luminosity coefficient to be consistent with zero. Additionally, we compare the data to simulations with different colour models, and find that the data prefers a model with a flat dependence of R<SUB>V</SUB> on colour over a declining dependence. Finally, our results strongly support that line-of-sight R<SUB>V</SUB> to SNe Ia is not a single value, but forms a distribution.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.4822R
Multiple flares caused by mass ejection episodes during the advanced nebular phase of Nova Scuti 2019;;Our photometric and spectroscopic monitoring shows that starting with 2020 June 4, day +217 from optical maximum and well into its advanced nebular stage, Nova Scuti (Nova Sct) 2019 begun displaying a series of nine large amplitude flares (up to $\Delta m \sim 1.7$ mag), characterized by a rapid rise to peak (≤10 h) and a fast exponential decline (e-folding time ~50 h). The time interval Δt between flares follows an ordered sequence, declining from 8.43 to 4.90 d, that safely allows to exclude that any other flare occurred without being recorded by the observations. When the sequence of flares was over by 2020 July 28 (day +271), Nova Sct 2019 slowed its overall decline rate from Δm = 0.0067 to 0.0027 mag d<SUP>-1</SUP>. The flares were caused by material expelled at high velocity (~1000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) from the still burning white dwarf (WD). The cooler pseudo-photosphere forming at each flare in the expelled material, resulted in a recombination wave to spread through the original nova ejecta (at ~170 au from the WD), quenching emission from [Fe X] and [Fe VII] and boosting that from lower ionization species. After each flare, once the small amount of expelled material had turned optically thin, the original nova ejecta resumed displaying [Fe X] and [Fe VII] emission lines, a fact that clearly proves the direct photoionization action exerted on the ejecta by the burning WD. While the other known flaring novae (V458 Vul, V4745 Sgr, and V5588 Sgr) presented the flares close to maximum brightness and with increasing Δt, Nova Sct 2019 is unique in having displayed them during the advanced nebular stage and with decreasing Δt.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.4805M
Numerical relativity simulations of the neutron star merger GW190425: microphysics and mass ratio effects;;GW190425 was the second gravitational wave (GW) signal compatible with a binary neutron star (BNS) merger detected by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Since no electromagnetic counterpart was identified, whether the associated kilonova was too dim or the localization area too broad is still an open question. We simulate 28 BNS mergers with the chirp mass of GW190425 and mass ratio 1 ≤ q ≤ 1.67, using numerical-relativity simulations with finite-temperature, composition dependent equations of state (EOS) and neutrino radiation. The energy emitted in GWs is $\lesssim 0.083\mathrm{\, M_\odot }c^2$ with peak luminosity of 1.1-$2.4\times ~10^{58}/(1+q)^2\, {\rm {erg \, s^{-1}}}$. Dynamical ejecta and disc mass range between 5 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP>-10<SUP>-3</SUP> and 10<SUP>-5</SUP>-$0.1 \mathrm{\, M_\odot }$, respectively. Asymmetric mergers, especially with stiff EOSs, unbind more matter and form heavier discs compared to equal mass binaries. The angular momentum of the disc is 8-$10\mathrm{\, M_\odot }~GM_{\rm {disc}}/c$ over three orders of magnitude in M<SUB>disc</SUB>. While the nucleosynthesis shows no peculiarity, the simulated kilonovae are relatively dim compared with GW170817. For distances compatible with GW190425, AB magnitudes are always dimmer than ~20 mag for the B, r, and K bands, with brighter kilonovae associated to more asymmetric binaries and stiffer EOSs. We suggest that, even assuming a good coverage of GW190425's sky location, the kilonova could hardly have been detected by present wide-field surveys and no firm constraints on the binary parameters or EOS can be argued from the lack of the detection.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.4760C
GROWTH on S190426c II: GROWTH-India Telescope search for an optical counterpart with a custom image reduction and candidate vetting pipeline;;S190426c/GW190426_152155 was the first probable neutron star-black hole merger candidate detected by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration. We undertook a tiled search for optical counterparts of this event using the 0.7-m GROWTH-India Telescope. Over a period of two weeks, we obtained multiple observations over a 22.1 deg<SUP>2</SUP> area, with a 17.5 per cent probability of containing the source location. Initial efforts included obtaining photometry of sources reported by various groups, and a visual search for sources in all galaxies contained in the region. Subsequently, we have developed an image subtraction and candidate vetting pipeline with $\sim 94{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ efficiency for transient detection. Processing the data with this pipeline, we find several transients, but none that are compatible with kilonova models. We present the details of our observations, the working of our pipeline, results from the search, and our interpretations of the non-detections that will work as a pathfinder during the O4 run of LVK.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.4517K
The recurrent nova U Scorpii from the 2010.1 to 2022.4 eruptions; the missed eruption of 2016.78 ± 0.10 and the critical complex period changes;;U Sco is a recurrent nova with 11 observed eruptions, most recently in 2010.1 and 2022.4. I report on my program (running since 1989) of measuring eclipse times and brightnesses of U Sco in quiescence, from 2010 to 2022. The orbital period suddenly increased by +22.4 ± 1.0 parts-per-million across the 2010.1 eruption. This period change is greater than the near-zero period change (+3.9 ± 6.1 parts-per-million) across the 1999.2 eruption. This period change cannot come from any of the usual mechanisms, whereas the one remaining possibility is that the period changes are dominated by the little-known mechanism of the nova ejecting asymmetric shells. From 2010.1 to 2016.78, the O - C curve showed a steady period change that was large, with $\dot{P}$ = (-21.0 ± 3.2) × 10<SUP>-9</SUP>. This is greatly higher than the steady period changes in the two previous inter-eruption intervals (-3.2 ± 1.9 and -1.1 ± 1.1 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP>). This large, variable, and negative $\dot{P}$ apparently comes from magnetic braking of the companion star's rotation. Starting in 2016.9 ± 0.6, the O - C curve showed a strong kink that is a unique characteristic of the sudden period change (+35.4 ± 7.1 parts-per-million) across a nova event. The brightness in quiescence after 2010.4 shows that the white dwarf accreted the trigger mass for the next nova event in the year 2017.1 ± 0.6. Photometric records show the only possible time for the eruption to peak (such that its total duration of 60 d was undetectable by any observation) is during a 75-d interval inside the 2016 solar gap, thus constraining the missed eruption to 2016.78 ± 0.10.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.4497S
A 3.8 yr optical quasi-periodic oscillations in blue quasar SDSS J132144+033055 through combined light curves from CSS and ZTF;;In the manuscript, a 3.8 yr optical quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) is reported in blue quasar SDSS J132144+033055 (= SDSS J1321) at z = 0.269, based on 16.3yr-long light curve from both CSS and ZTF directly described by a sinusoidal function. The 3.8 yr QPOs can be confirmed through the Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram with confidence level higher than 5σ, through properties of the phase-folded light curve and the WWZ technique. Moreover, the collected Pan-STARRS light curves well follow the sinusoidal function described best fitting results to the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) and Catalina Sky Survey (ZTF) light curves. The optical QPOs strongly indicate a central binary black hole (BBH) system in SDSS J1321, with expected space separation smaller than 0.018 pc, through the estimated upper limit of total BH mass 3.3 × 10<SUP>9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> through the correlation between BH mass and continuum luminosity. Meanwhile, we check disc precession applied to explain the optical QPOs. However, under the disc precession assumption, the determined optical emission regions from central BH have sizes about 37R<SUB>G</SUB> similar as the sizes 35R<SUB>G</SUB> of the expected NUV emission regions through the correlation between disc size and BH mass, indicating the disc precession is not preferred. And due to undetected radio emissions, jet precession can be ruled out. Furthermore, only 0.1 per cent probability can determined as the QPOs mis-detected through CAR process randomly created light curves related to intrinsic AGN activities, re-confirming the optical QPOs with significance level higher than 3σ. Therefore, combining long-term light curves from CSS and ZTF can lead to more QPOs candidates in the near future.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.3650Z
Birth of a Be star: an APOGEE search for Be stars forming through binary mass transfer;;Motivated by recent suggestions that many Be stars form through binary mass transfer, we searched the APOGEE survey for Be stars with bloated, stripped companions. From a well-defined parent sample of 297 Be stars, we identified one mass-transfer binary, HD 15124. The object consists of a main-sequence Be star ($M_{\rm Be}=5.3\pm 0.6\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$) with a low-mass ($M_{\rm donor}=0.92\pm 0.22\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$), subgiant companion on a 5.47-d orbit. The emission lines originate in an accretion disc caused by ongoing mass transfer, not from a decretion disc as in classical Be stars. Both stars have surface abundances bearing imprint of CNO processing in the donor's core: the surface helium fraction is Y<SUB>He</SUB> ≈ 0.6, and the nitrogen-to-carbon ratio is 1000 times the solar value. The system's properties are well-matched by binary evolution models in which mass transfer begins while a $3-5\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$ donor leaves the main sequence, with the originally less massive component becoming the Be star. These models predict that the system will soon become a detached Be + stripped star binary like HR 6819 and LB-1, with the stripped donor eventually contracting to become a core helium-burning sdO/B star. Discovery of one object in this short-lived (~1 Myr) evolutionary phase implies the existence of many more that have already passed through it and are now Be + sdO/B binaries. We infer that $(10-60)\, {{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of Be stars have stripped companions, most of which are $\sim 100\, \times$ fainter than the Be stars in the optical. Together with the dearth of main-sequence companions to Be stars and recent discovery of numerous Be + sdO/B binaries in the UV, our results imply that binarity plays an important role in the formation of Be stars.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.3602E
Short-duration accretion states of Polars as seen in TESS and ZTF data;;Polars are highly magnetic cataclysmic variables which have been long observed to have both high and low brightness states. The duration of these states has been previously seen to vary from a number of days up to years. Despite this, these states and their physical origin have not been explained in a consistent manner. We present observations of the shortest duration states of a number of Polars observed by ZTF and TESS. This has allowed us to determine that short-duration states are a relatively common feature across the population of Polars. Furthermore, we have been able to generalize the model of star-spot migration to explain both short-lived high and low states in Polars by incorporating the interaction between the magnetic field of the white dwarf and that of the star spots.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.3144D
Physical analysis of Yukawa-Casimir traversable wormhole solutions in non-minimally coupled f(T) gravity;;This article is based on the analysis of wormhole geometries in the perspective of non-minimal torsion-matter coupled gravity. In this work, we consider an explicit non-minimal coupling between an impulsive function of torsion scalar and the Lagrangian density of matter. In this exploration, we propose two profiles of energy densities for two non-minimally coupled f(T) gravity models and graphical plots are analyzed for different viable solutions. Wormhole solutions obtained from these models corresponding to Casimir profile violate null energy condition, whereas solutions corresponding to Yukawa-Casimir profile satisfy the null energy condition to support the wormhole geometries. Moreover, we also examine the stability of obtained solutions through Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and it exhibits that our calculated results are stable.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022EPJP..137.1274J
Strongly Lensed Transient Sources: A Review;;The past decades have witnessed a lot of progress in gravitational lensing with two main targets: stars and galaxies (with active galactic nuclei). The success is partially attributed to the continuous luminescence of these sources making the detection and monitoring relatively easy. With the running of ongoing and upcoming large facilities/surveys in various electromagnetic and gravitational-wave bands, the era of time-domain surveys would guarantee constant detection of strongly lensed explosive transient events, for example, supernovae in all types, gamma ray bursts with afterglows in all bands, fast radio bursts, and even gravitational waves. Lensed transients have many advantages over the traditional targets in studying the Universe, and magnification effect helps to understand the transients themselves at high redshifts. In this review article, on base of the recent achievements in literature, we summarize the methods of searching for different kinds of lensed transient signals, the latest results on detection and their applications in fundamental physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. At the same time, we give supplementary comments as well as prospects of this emerging research direction that may help readers who are interested in entering this field.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ChPhL..39k9801L
The First Detection of an Orphan Burst at the Rise Phase;;We report on the earliest detection of the optical transient MASTER OT J123248.62-012924.5 coincident within the error box with the optical and X-ray transient AT2021lfa/ZTF21aayokph. In our images the brightness of the object rises monotonically with $7σ$ confidence. We interpret this transient as a gamma-ray burst (GRB) characterized by smooth optical self-similar (SOSS) emission, while the nondetection of gamma-ray emission at space observatories is interpreted in terms of the hypothesis of a ``failed'' GRB. Thus, this is the first detection of a nonmonotonic orphan burst.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AstL...48..623L
Extreme Mass Loss in Low-mass Type Ib/c Supernova Progenitors;;Many core-collapse supernovae (SNe) with hydrogen-poor and low-mass ejecta, such as ultra-stripped SNe and type Ibn SNe, are observed to interact with dense circumstellar material (CSM). These events likely arise from the core collapse of helium stars that have been heavily stripped by a binary companion and have ejected significant mass during the last weeks to years of their lives. In helium star models run to days before core collapse we identify a range of helium core masses ≈2.5-3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> whose envelopes expand substantially due to the helium shell burning while the core undergoes neon and oxygen burning. When modeled in binary systems, the rapid expansion of these helium stars induces extremely high rates of late-stage mass transfer ( $\dot{M}rsim {10}^{-2}\,{M}_{\odot }\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$ Ṁ≳10-2M⊙yr-1 ) beginning weeks to decades before core collapse. We consider two scenarios for producing CSM in these systems: either mass transfer remains stable and mass loss is driven from the system in the vicinity of the accreting companion, or mass transfer becomes unstable and causes a common envelope event (CEE) through which the helium envelope is unbound. The ensuing CSM properties are consistent with the CSM masses (~10<SUP>-2</SUP>-1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) and radii (~10<SUP>13</SUP>-10<SUP>16</SUP> cm) inferred for ultra-stripped SNe and several type Ibn SNe. Furthermore, systems that undergo a CEE could produce short-period neutron star binaries that merge in less than 100 Myr.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940L..27W
Orbital Decay of Double White Dwarfs: Beyond Gravitational-wave Radiation Effects;;The traditional description of the orbital evolution of compact-object binaries, like double white dwarfs (DWDs), assumes that the system is driven only by gravitational-wave (GW) radiation. However, the high magnetic fields with intensities of up to gigagausses measured in WDs alert a potential role of the electromagnetic (EM) emission in the evolution of DWDs. We evaluate the orbital dynamics of DWDs under the effects of GW radiation, tidal synchronization, and EM emission by a unipolar inductor generated by the magnetic primary and the relative motion of the nonmagnetic secondary. We show that the EM emission can affect the orbital dynamics for magnetic fields larger than megagausses. We applied the model to two known DWDs, SDSS J0651+2844 and ZTF J1539+5027, for which the GW radiation alone does not fully account for the measured orbital decay rate. We obtain upper limits to the primary's magnetic field strength, over which the EM emission causes an orbital decay faster than observed. The contribution of tidal locking and the EM emission is comparable, and together they can contribute up to 20% to the measured orbital decay rate. We show that the gravitational waveform for a DWD modeled as purely driven by GWs and including tidal interactions and EM emission can have large relative dephasing detectable in the mHz regime of frequencies relevant for space-based detectors like LISA. Therefore, including physics besides GW radiation in the waveform templates is essential to calibrate the GW detectors using known sources, e.g., ZTF J1539+5027, and to infer binary parameters.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940...90C
Active Galactic Nuclei Continuum Reverberation Mapping Based on Zwicky Transient Facility Light Curves;;We perform a systematic survey of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) continuum lags using ~3 days cadence gri-band light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We select a sample of 94 type 1 AGNs at z < 0.8 with significant and consistent inter-band lags based on the interpolated cross-correlation function method and the Bayesian method JAVELIN. Within the framework of the "lamp-post" reprocessing model, our findings are: (1) The continuum emission (CE) sizes inferred from the data are larger than the disk sizes predicted by the standard thin-disk model. (2) For a subset of the sample, the CE size exceeds the theoretical limit of the self-gravity radius (12 lt-days) for geometrically thin disks. (3) The CE size scales with continuum luminosity as R <SUB>CE</SUB> ∝ L <SUP>0.48±0.04</SUP> with a scatter of 0.2 dex, analogous to the well-known radius-luminosity relation of broad Hβ. These findings suggest a significant contribution of diffuse continuum emission from the broad-line region (BLR) to AGN continuum lags. We find that the R <SUB>CE</SUB>-L relation can be explained by a photoionization model that assumes ~23% of the total flux comes from the diffuse BLR emission. In addition, the ratio of the CE size and model-predicted disk size anticorrelates with the continuum luminosity, which is indicative of a potential nondisk BLR lag contribution evolving with the luminosity. Finally, a robust positive correlation between the CE size and black hole mass is detected.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940...20G
Perfecting Our Set of Spectrophotometric Standard DA White Dwarfs;;We verified for photometric stability a set of DA white dwarfs with Hubble Space Telescope magnitudes from the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared and ground-based spectroscopy by using time-spaced observations from the Las Cumbres Observatory network of telescopes. The initial list of 38 stars was whittled to 32 final ones, which comprise a high-quality set of spectrophotometric standards. These stars are homogeneously distributed around the sky and are all fainter than r ~ 16.5 mag. Their distribution is such that at least two of them would be available to be observed from any observatory on the ground at any time at airmass less than 2. Light curves and different variability indices from the Las Cumbres Observatory data were used to determine the stability of the candidate standards. When available, Pan-STARRS1, Zwicky Transient Facility, and TESS data were also used to confirm the star classification. Our analysis showed that four DA white dwarfs may exhibit evidence of photometric variability, while a fifth is cooler than our established lower temperature limit, and a sixth star might be a binary. In some instances, due to the presence of faint nearby red sources, care should be used when observing a few of the spectrophotometric standards with ground-based telescopes. Light curves and finding charts for all the stars are provided.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940...19C
The Luminosity Function of Tidal Disruption Flares for the ZTF-I Survey;;The high-cadence survey of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) has completely dominated the discovery of tidal disruption events (TDEs) in the past few years and resulted in the largest sample of TDEs with optical/UV light curves well sampled around their peaks, providing us an excellent opportunity to construct a peak luminosity function (LF) of tidal disruption flares (TDFs). The new construction is necessary particularly considering that the most updated LF reported in literature has been inferred from only 13 sources from five different surveys. Here we present the optical and blackbody LFs calculated by 33 TDFs discovered in the ZTF-I survey. The optical LF can be described by both a power-law profile ${dN}/{{dL}}_{g}\propto {L}_{g}^{-2.3\pm 0.2}$ , and a Schechter-like function. The blackbody LF can be described by a power-law profile ${dN}/{{dL}}_{\mathrm{bb}}\propto {L}_{\mathrm{bb}}^{-2.2\pm 0.2}$ , shallower than the LF made of the previous van Velzen (2018) sample. A possible low-luminosity turnover in the optical LF supports an Eddington-limited emission scenario. The drop of the volumetric rate at high luminosity suggests a rate suppression due to direct captures of the black hole. The total volumetric rate is 1 order of magnitude lower than the previous estimation, which is probably not simply caused by the high fraction postpeak sources (7/13) in the previous sample. Instead, the normalization step during the previous LF construction to reconcile various surveys might adversely amplify the influence of serendipitous discoveries. Therefore, TDFs selected from ongoing and upcoming uniform surveys like ZTF, Vera Rubin Observatory, and the Wide-Field Survey Telescope should yield more accurate LFs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...939L..33L
A Transient "Changing-look" Active Galactic Nucleus Resolved on Month Timescales from First-year Sloan Digital Sky Survey V Data;;We report the discovery of a new "changing-look" active galactic nucleus (CLAGN) event, in the quasar SDSS J162829.17+432948.5 at z = 0.2603, identified through repeat spectroscopy from the fifth Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V). Optical photometry taken during 2020-2021 shows a dramatic dimming of Δg ≈ 1 mag, followed by a rapid recovery on a timescale of several months, with the ≲2 month period of rebrightening captured in new SDSS-V and Las Cumbres Observatory spectroscopy. This is one of the fastest CLAGN transitions observed to date. Archival observations suggest that the object experienced a much more gradual dimming over the period of 2011-2013. Our spectroscopy shows that the photometric changes were accompanied by dramatic variations in the quasar-like continuum and broad-line emission. The excellent agreement between the pre- and postdip photometric and spectroscopic appearances of the source, as well as the fact that the dimmest spectra can be reproduced by applying a single extinction law to the brighter spectral states, favor a variable line-of-sight obscuration as the driver of the observed transitions. Such an interpretation faces several theoretical challenges, and thus an alternative accretion-driven scenario cannot be excluded. The recent events observed in this quasar highlight the importance of spectroscopic monitoring of large active galactic nucleus samples on weeks-to-months timescales, which the SDSS-V is designed to achieve.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...939L..16Z
Spectral Evolution of Dark Asteroid Surfaces Induced by Space Weathering over a Decade;;The surfaces of airless bodies like asteroids in the solar system are known to be affected by space weathering. Experiments simulating space weathering are essential for studying the effects of this process on meteorite samples, but the problem is that the time spent to reproduce space weathering in these experiments is billions of times shorter than the actual phenomenon. In 2010 December, the T-type asteroid 596 Scheila underwent a collision with an impactor a few tens of meters in size. A decade later, there is an opportunity to study how the surface layer of this asteroid is being altered by space weathering after the impact. To do so, we performed visible spectrophotometric and near-infrared spectroscopic observations of 596 Scheila. The acquired spectrum is consistent with those observed shortly after the 2010 impact event within the observational uncertainty range. This indicates that the surface color of dark asteroids is not noticeably changed by space weathering over a 10 yr period. This study is the first to investigate color changes due to space weathering on an actual asteroid surface in the solar system. Considering that fresh layers are regularly created on asteroid surfaces by collisions, we suggest a genetic link between D/T-type and dark (low albedo) X-complex asteroids and very red objects such as 269 Justitia, 732 Tjilaki, and 203 Pompeja. New observations show that 203 Pompeja has an X-type-like surface, with some local surface areas exhibiting a very red spectrum.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...939L...9H
Seven Years of Coordinated Chandra-NuSTAR Observations of SN 2014C Unfold the Extreme Mass-loss History of Its Stellar Progenitor;;We present the results from our 7 yr long broadband X-ray observing campaign of SN 2014C with Chandra and NuSTAR. These coordinated observations represent the first look at the evolution of a young extragalactic SN in the 0.3-80 keV energy range in the years after core collapse. We find that the spectroscopic metamorphosis of SN 2014C from an ordinary type Ib SN into an interacting SN with copious hydrogen emission is accompanied by luminous X-rays reaching L <SUB> x </SUB> ≈ 5.6 × 10<SUP>40</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> (0.3-100 keV) at ~1000 days post-explosion and declining as L <SUB> x </SUB> ∝ t <SUP>-1</SUP> afterwards. The broadband X-ray spectrum is of thermal origin and shows clear evidence for cooling after peak, with $T{(t)\approx 20\,\mathrm{keV}(t/{t}_{\mathrm{pk}})}^{-0.5}$ . Soft X-rays of sub-keV energy suffer from large photoelectric absorption originating from the local SN environment with ${\mathrm{NH}}_{\mathrm{int}}{(t)\approx 3\times {10}^{22}(t/400\,\mathrm{days})}^{-1.4}\,{\mathrm{cm}}^{-2}$ . We interpret these findings as the result of the interaction of the SN shock with a dense (n ≈ 10<SUP>5</SUP> - 10<SUP>6</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>), H-rich disk-like circumstellar medium (CSM) with inner radius ~2 × 10<SUP>16</SUP> cm and extending to ~10<SUP>17</SUP> cm. Based on the declining NH<SUB>int</SUB>(t) and X-ray luminosity evolution, we infer a CSM mass of ~(1.2 f-2.0 $\sqrt{f}){M}_{\odot }$ , where f is the volume filling factor. We place SN 2014C in the context of 121 core-collapse SNe with evidence for strong shock interaction with a thick circumstellar medium. Finally, we highlight the challenges that the current mass-loss theories (including wave-driven mass loss, binary interaction, and line-driven winds) face when interpreting the wide dynamic ranges of CSM parameters inferred from observations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...939..105B
Detecting Magnetospheric Radio Emission from Giant Exoplanets;;As radio astronomy enters a golden age, ground-based observatories are reaching sensitivities capable of unlocking a new and exciting field of exoplanet observation. Radio observation of planetary auroral emission provides unique and complementary insight into planetary science not available via orthodox exoplanet observation techniques. Supplying the first measurements of planetary magnetic fields, rotation rates, and orbital obliquities, we gain necessary and crucial insight into our understanding of the star-planet relationships, geophysics, composition, and habitability of exoplanets. Using a stellar-wind-driven Jovian approximation, we present analytical methods for estimating magnetospheric radio emission from confirmed exoplanets. Predicted radio fluxes from cataloged exoplanets are compared against the wavelengths and sensitivities of current and future observatories. Candidate exoplanets are downselected based on the sky coverage of each ground-based observatory. Orbits of target exoplanets are modeled to account for influential orbit-dependent effects in anticipating time-varying exoplanet radio luminosity and flux. To evaluate the angular alignment of exoplanetary beamed emission relative to Earth's position, the equatorial latitude of exoplanetary auroral emission is compared against Earth's apparent latitude on the exoplanet. Predicted time-dependent measurements and recommended beamformed observations for ground-based radio arrays are provided, along with a detailed analysis of the anticipated emission behavior for τ Boo b.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...939...24A
Spectropolarimetry of the Thermonuclear Supernova SN 2021rhu: High Calcium Polarization 79 Days after Peak Luminosity;;We report spectropolarimetric observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN) SN 2021rhu at four epochs: -7, +0, +36, and +79 days relative to its B-band maximum luminosity. A wavelength-dependent continuum polarization peaking at 3890 ± 93 Å and reaching a level of ${p}_{\max }\,=\,1.78 \% \pm 0.02$ % was found. The peak of the polarization curve is bluer than is typical in the Milky Way, indicating a larger proportion of small dust grains along the sight line to the SN. After removing the interstellar polarization, we found a pronounced increase of the polarization in the Ca II near-infrared triplet, from ~0.3% at day -7 to ~2.5% at day +79. No temporal evolution in high-resolution flux spectra across the Na I D and Ca II H and K features was seen from days +39 to +74, indicating that the late-time increase in polarization is intrinsic to the SN as opposed to being caused by scattering of SN photons in circumstellar or interstellar matter. We suggest that an explanation for the late-time rise of the Ca II near-infrared triplet polarization may be the alignment of calcium atoms in a weak magnetic field through optical excitation/pumping by anisotropic radiation from the SN.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...939...18Y
SALT3-NIR: Taking the Open-source Type Ia Supernova Model to Longer Wavelengths for Next-generation Cosmological Measurements;;A large fraction of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) observations over the next decade will be in the near-infrared (NIR), at wavelengths beyond the reach of the current standard light-curve model for SN Ia cosmology, SALT3 (~2800-8700 Å central filter wavelength). To harness this new SN Ia sample and reduce future light-curve standardization systematic uncertainties, we train SALT3 at NIR wavelengths (SALT3-NIR) up to 2 μm with the open-source model-training software SALTshaker, which can easily accommodate future observations. Using simulated data, we show that the training process constrains the NIR model to ~2%-3% across the phase range (-20 to 50 days). We find that Hubble residual (HR) scatter is smaller using the NIR alone or optical+NIR compared to optical alone, by up to ~30% depending on filter choice (95% confidence). There is significant correlation between NIR light-curve stretch measurements and luminosity, with stretch and color corrections often improving HR scatter by up to ~20%. For SN Ia observations expected from the Roman Space Telescope, SALT3-NIR increases the amount of usable data in the SALT framework by ~20% at redshift z ≲ 0.4 and by ~50% at z ≲ 0.15. The SALT3-NIR model is part of the open-source SNCosmo and SNANA SN Ia cosmology packages.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...939...11P
GLEAM-X J162759.5−523504.3 as a white dwarf pulsar;;The low frequency radio source GLEAM-X J162759.5−523504.3 emits pulsed coherent polarized emission like that of radio pulsars. Yet its period of 18.18 min (1091 s) is hundreds of times longer than those of confirmed radio pulsars, and if it is a neutron star its mean radiated power exceeds the upper limit on its spin-down power by more than an order of magnitude. This may be explained if it is a white dwarf pulsar, with a moment of inertia several orders of magnitude greater than those of neutron stars. The Lorentz factor of the emitting charge bunches may be bounded from below by the widths of the temporal substructure of their radiation. If the emission is curvature radiation, the radius of curvature may be estimated from the Lorentz factor and the frequencies of emission; it is consistent with a white dwarf's inner magnetosphere but not a neutron star's.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Ap&SS.367..108K
Kepler and the Behemoth: Three Mini-Neptunes in a 40 Million Year Old Association;;Stellar positions and velocities from Gaia are yielding a new view of open cluster dispersal. Here we present an analysis of a group of stars spanning Cepheus (l = 100°) to Hercules (l = 40°), hereafter the Cep-Her complex. The group includes four Kepler objects of interest: Kepler-1643 b (R <SUB>p</SUB> = 2.32 ± 0.13 R <SUB>⊕</SUB>, P = 5.3 days), KOI-7368 b (R <SUB>p</SUB> = 2.22 ± 0.12 R <SUB>⊕</SUB>, P = 6.8 days), KOI-7913 Ab (R <SUB>p</SUB> = 2.34 ± 0.18 R <SUB>⊕</SUB>, P = 24.2 days), and Kepler-1627 Ab (R <SUB>p</SUB> = 3.85 ± 0.11 R <SUB>⊕</SUB>, P = 7.2 days). The latter Neptune-sized planet is in part of the Cep-Her complex called the δ Lyr cluster. Here we focus on the former three systems, which are in other regions of the association. Based on kinematic evidence from Gaia, stellar rotation periods from TESS, and spectroscopy, these three objects are also ≈40 million years (Myr) old. More specifically, we find that Kepler-1643 is ${46}_{-7}^{+9}$ Myr old, based on its membership in a dense subcluster of the complex called RSG-5. KOI-7368 and KOI-7913 are ${36}_{-8}^{+10}$ Myr old, and are in a diffuse region that we call CH-2. Based on the transit shapes and high-resolution imaging, all three objects are most likely planets, with false-positive probabilities of 6 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP>, 4 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP>, and 1 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> for Kepler-1643, KOI-7368, and KOI-7913, respectively. These planets demonstrate that mini-Neptunes with sizes of ≈2 Earth radii exist at ages of 40 Myr.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..215B
Extremely Low Mass Ratio Contact Binaries. I. The First Photometric and Spectroscopic Investigations of Ten Systems;;The photometric and spectroscopic investigations of ten contact binaries were presented for the first time. It is discovered that the mass ratios of all the ten targets are smaller than 0.15, they are extremely low mass ratio contact binaries. Seven of them are deep contact binaries, two are medium contact binaries, while only one is a shallow contact system. Five of them show the O'Connell effect, and a dark spot on one of the two components can lead to a good fit of the asymmetric light curves. The orbital period studies of the ten binaries reveal that they all exhibit long-term period changes, six of them are increasing, while the others are shrinking. The LAMOST spectra were analyzed by the spectral subtraction method, and all the ten targets exhibit excess emissions in the H<SUB> α </SUB> line, indicating chromospheric activity. The evolutionary states of the two components of the ten binaries were studied, and it is found that their evolutionary states are identical to those of the other contact binaries. Based on the study of the relation between orbital angular momentum and total mass, we discovered the ten systems may be at the late evolutionary stage of a contact binary. The initial masses of the two components and the ages of them were obtained. By calculating the instability parameters, we found that the ten contact binaries are relatively stable at present.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..202L
Fast Derivation of Contact Binary Parameters for Large Photometric Surveys;;Thanks to an enormous release of light curves of contact binaries, it is a challenge to derive the parameters of contact binaries using the Phoebe program and the Wilson-Devinney program with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. In this paper, we use neural network (NN) and MCMC algorithm to derive the parameters of contact binaries. The fitting of models is still done with the MCMC algorithm, but that the neural network is used to establish the mapping relationship between the parameters and the light curves generated beforehand by Phoebe. The NN model is trained with a set of Phoebe-generated light curves with known input parameters, and then combined with the MCMC algorithm to quickly obtain the posterior distribution of the parameters. Two NN models without and with the influence of third light are established, which can generate light curves with 100 points faster than Phoebe by about four orders of magnitude under the same running condition. In addition, the two models can generate the light curves with an error of less than a millimagnitude. The feasibility of NN and MCMC algorithm is also verified by the synthetic light curves generated by Phoebe and the light curves from Kepler survey data. NN and MCMC algorithms can quickly derive the parameters and the corresponding parameter errors of contact binaries from sky survey. These parameters can also be used as more precise initial input values for the objectives of individual detailed studies.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..200D
DELIGHT: Deep Learning Identification of Galaxy Hosts of Transients using Multiresolution Images;;We present DELIGHT, or Deep Learning Identification of Galaxy Hosts of Transients, a new algorithm designed to automatically and in real time identify the host galaxies of extragalactic transients. The proposed algorithm receives as input compact, multiresolution images centered at the position of a transient candidate and outputs two-dimensional offset vectors that connect the transient with the center of its predicted host. The multiresolution input consists of a set of images with the same number of pixels, but with progressively larger pixel sizes and fields of view. A sample of 16,791 galaxies visually identified by the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events broker team was used to train a convolutional neural network regression model. We show that this method is able to correctly identify both relatively large (10″ < r < 60″) and small (r ≤ 10″) apparent size host galaxies using much less information (32 kB) than with a large, single-resolution image (920 kB). The proposed method has fewer catastrophic errors in recovering the position and is more complete and has less contamination (<0.86%) recovering the crossmatched redshift than other state-of-the-art methods. The more efficient representation provided by multiresolution input images could allow for the identification of transient host galaxies in real time, if adopted in alert streams from new generation of large -etendue telescopes such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..195F
Zwicky Transient Facility and Globular Clusters: The Period-Luminosity and Period-Wesenheit Relations for Anomalous Cepheids Supplemented with Large Magellanic Cloud Sample;;We present the first gri-band period-luminosity (PL) and period-Wesenheit (PW) relations for the fundamental mode anomalous Cepheids. These PL and PW relations were derived from a combined sample of five anomalous Cepheids in globular cluster M92 and the Large Magellanic Cloud, both of which have distance accurate to ~1% available from literature. Our g-band PL relation is similar to the B-band PL relation as reported in previous study. We applied our PL and PW relations to anomalous Cepheids discovered in dwarf galaxy Crater II, and found a larger but consistent distance modulus than the recent measurements based on RR Lyrae. Our calibrations of gri-band PL and PW relations, even though less precise due to small number of anomalous Cepheids, will be useful for distance measurements to dwarf galaxies.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..191N
Supernova double-peaked light curves from double-nickel distribution;;Among supernovae (SNe) of different luminosities, many double-peaked light curves (LCs) have been observed, representing a broad morphological variety. In this work, we investigate which of these can be modelled by assuming a double-peaked distribution of their radioactive material, as originally proposed for SN2005bf. The inner zone corresponds to the regular explosive nucleosynthesis and extends outwards, according to the usual scenario of mixing. The outer <SUP>56</SUP>Ni-rich shell may be related to the effect of jet-like outflows that have interacted with more distant portions of the star before the arrival of the SN shock. As the outer layer is covered by matter that is optically less thick, its energy emerges earlier and generates a first peak of radiation. To investigate this scenario in more detail, we have applied our hydrodynamic code that follows the shock propagation through the progenitor star and takes into account the effect of the γ-ray photons produced by the decay of the radioactive isotopes. We present a simple parametric model for the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni abundance profile and explore the consequences on the LC of individually varying the quantities that define this distribution, setting our focus onto the stripped-envelope progenitors. In this first study, we are interested in the applicability of this model to SNe that have not been classified as superluminous, thus, we have selected our parameter space accordingly. Then, within the same mathematical prescription for the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni -profile, we revisited the modelling process for a series of objects: SN2005bf, PTF2011mnb, SN2019cad, and SN2008D. In some cases, a decrease in the gamma ray opacity is required to fit the late time observations. We also discuss the other cases in which this scenario might be likely to explain the LC morphology. A steep initial decline in the observed bolometric LC within less than few days after the explosion becomes less feasible for this model, because it requires a large abundance of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni near the stellar surface, indicating a strongly inverted distribution. An initial bolometric rise before the two peaks seems more favourable for the double-nickel case, particularly as it can be difficult to explain through other scenarios, unless a combination of power sources is invoked.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...667A..92O
Satellite shadows through stellar occultations;;
 Aims: The impact of mega-constellations of satellites in low-Earth orbit during nighttime optical observations is assessed. 
 Methods: Orbital geometry is used to calculate the impact of stellar occultations by satellites on the photometry of individual stars as well as the effect on the photometric calibration of wide-field observations. 
 Results: Starlink-type satellites will have occultation disks several arcseconds across. Together with occultation crossing times of 0.1−100 ms, this will lead to photometric `jitter' on the flux determination of stars. The level of impact for a given star depends on the ratio of the integration time of the frame over the occultation crossing time. In current-day CCD-based synoptic surveys, this impact is negligible (≪1%), but with future CMOS-based wide-field surveys obtaining data at frequencies >1 Hz, the impact will grow towards complete dropouts. At integration times similar to the occultation crossing time, the orbit of a satellite can be traced using the occultation method. At even shorter integration times, the shape of the occulting satellite can be deduced. 
 Conclusions: Stellar occultations by passing satellites, enabled by high-speed CMOS technology, will be a new method for studying orbiting satellites. Large-scale monitoring programs will be needed to independently determine and update the orbits of satellites.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...667A..45G
Tests of gravitational-wave birefringence with the open gravitational-wave catalog;;We report the results of testing gravitational-wave birefringence using the largest population of gravitational-wave events currently available. Gravitational-wave birefringence, which can arise from the effective field theory extension of general relativity, occurs when the parity symmetry is broken, causing the left- and right-handed polarizations to propagate following different equations of motion. We perform Bayesian inference on the 94 events reported by the 4th-Open Gravitational-wave Catalog (4-OGC) using a parity-violating waveform. We find no evidence for a violation of general relativity in the vast majority of events. However, the most massive event, GW190521, and the second most massive event, GW191109, show intriguing nonzero results for gravitational-wave birefringence. We find that the probability of association between GW190521 and the possible electromagnetic (EM) counterpart reported by Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is increased when assuming birefringence. Excluding GW190521 and GW191109, the parity-violating energy scale is constrained to M<SUB>PV</SUB>>0.05 GeV at 90% credible interval, which is an improvement over previous results from twelve events by a factor of five. We discuss the implications of our results on modified gravity and possible alternative explanations such as waveform systematics. More detections of massive binary black hole mergers from the upcoming LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA run will shed light on the true origin of the apparent birefringence.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PhRvD.106h4005W
SNAD transient miner: Finding missed transient events in ZTF DR4 using k-D trees;;We report the automatic detection of 11 transients (7 possible supernovae and 4 active galactic nuclei candidates) within the Zwicky Transient Facility fourth data release (ZTF DR4), all of them observed in 2018 and absent from public catalogs. Among these, three were not part of the ZTF alert stream. Our transient mining strategy employs 41 physically motivated features extracted from both real light curves and four simulated light curve models (SN Ia, SN II, TDE, SLSN-I). These features are input to a k-D tree algorithm, from which we calculate the 15 nearest neighbors. After pre-processing and selection cuts, our dataset contained approximately a million objects among which we visually inspected the 105 closest neighbors from seven of our brightest, most well-sampled simulations, comprising 89 unique ZTF DR4 sources. Our result illustrates the potential of coherently incorporating domain knowledge and automatic learning algorithms, which is one of the guiding principles directing the SNAD team. It also demonstrates that the ZTF DR is a suitable testing ground for data mining algorithms aiming to prepare for the next generation of astronomical data.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022NewA...9601846A
A dense 0.1-solar-mass star in a 51-minute-orbital-period eclipsing binary;;Of more than a thousand known cataclysmic variables (CVs), where a white dwarf is accreting from a hydrogen-rich star, only a dozen have orbital periods below 75 minutes<SUP>1-9</SUP>. One way to achieve these short periods requires the donor star to have undergone substantial nuclear evolution before interacting with the white dwarf<SUP>10-14</SUP>, and it is expected that these objects will transition to helium accretion. These transitional CVs have been proposed as progenitors of helium CVs<SUP>13-18</SUP>. However, no known transitional CV is expected to reach an orbital period short enough to account for most of the helium CV population, leaving the role of this evolutionary pathway unclear. Here we report observations of ZTF J1813+4251, a 51-minute-orbital-period, fully eclipsing binary system consisting of a star with a temperature comparable to that of the Sun but a density 100 times greater owing to its helium-rich composition, accreting onto a white dwarf. Phase-resolved spectra, multi-band light curves and the broadband spectral energy distribution allow us to obtain precise and robust constraints on the masses, radii and temperatures of both components. Evolutionary modelling shows that ZTF J1813+4251 is destined to become a helium CV binary, reaching an orbital period under 20 minutes, rendering ZTF J1813+4251 a previously missing link between helium CV binaries and hydrogen-rich CVs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Natur.610..467B
Persistence of the blazar state in flat-spectrum radio quasars;;Flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), whose brightness is dominated by a relativistically beamed core, are frequently found in the 'blazar state' commonly inferred from a high optical polarization (> 3 per cent) and/or a large continuum variability. Here we use these two prime optical markers to investigate continuance of an FSRQ in the blazar (or non-blazar) state over an exceptionally long time baseline spanning four decades. Our basic sample is a well-defined, unbiased set of 80 FSRQs whose blazar state stood confirmed during the 1980s from optical polarimetry. Four decades later, the blazar state of each FSRQ is ascertained here from variability of their optical light curves with a typical duration of ~3.5 yr, a low noise (rms ~2 per cent) and good cadence (~3 d), obtained under the Zwicky Transient Facility project, which has been ongoing since 2018. For about 40 per cent of these FSRQs, the blazar state could be ascertained additionally from the opto-polarimetric survey RoboPol (2013-2017). From both these data bases, it is found that only ~10 per cent of the FSRQs have undergone a blazar ↔ non-blazar state transition over the past three to four decades. This reinforces the case for the long-term stability of the blazar state in individual FSRQs, despite their state fluctuating more commonly on year-like time-scales.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516L..18C
Dwarf AGNs from Optical Variability for the Origins of Seeds (DAVOS): insights from the dark energy survey deep fields;;We present a sample of 706, z < 1.5 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) selected from optical photometric variability in three of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) deep fields (E2, C3, and X3) over an area of 4.64 deg<SUP>2</SUP>. We construct light curves using difference imaging aperture photometry for resolved sources and non-difference imaging PSF photometry for unresolved sources, respectively, and characterize the variability significance. Our DES light curves have a mean cadence of 7 d, a 6-yr baseline, and a single-epoch imaging depth of up to g ~ 24.5. Using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, we find 26 out of total 706 variable galaxies are consistent with dwarf galaxies with a reliable stellar mass estimate ($M_{\ast } 10^{9.5}\, {\rm M}_\odot$; median photometric redshift of 0.9). We were able to constrain rapid characteristic variability time-scales (~ weeks) using the DES light curves in 15 dwarf AGN candidates (a subset of our variable AGN candidates) at a median photometric redshift of 0.4. This rapid variability is consistent with their low black hole (BH) masses. We confirm the low-mass AGN nature of one source with a high S/N optical spectrum. We publish our catalogue, optical light curves, and supplementary data, such as X-ray properties and optical spectra, when available. We measure a variable AGN fraction versus stellar mass and compare to results from a forward model. This work demonstrates the feasibility of optical variability to identify AGNs with lower BH masses in deep fields, which may be more 'pristine' analogues of supermassive BH seeds.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.2736B
Candidate and confirmed ultrashort period main-sequence binary stars;;The lower tail of the period distribution of main-sequence binary stars is poorly constrained due to the small number of such systems known. This paper deals with candidate binary stars with periods shorter than 0.2 d and colour indices consistent with them being M dwarfs. Three sources of candidates are considered - a catalogue of TESS eclipsing binaries, the ATLAS catalogue of variable stars, and binary stars from the 'International Variable Star Index' (VSX) website. The TESS eclipsing binary catalogue contains five new candidates satisfying the period and colour criteria. New photometry confirms one as a bona fide main-sequence system, and another as a white dwarf/red dwarf pair. New multicolour light curves of 10 ATLAS stars are presented: 7 of these are main sequence binaries with confirmed ultrashort periods (P < 0.2 d). There are 328 red VSX binary candidates with short periods. Literature searches for 77 of these with P < 0.17 d were performed: only 6 are previously studied main sequence systems, and another 14 are known red dwarf/white dwarf systems.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.2540K
Estimating sizes of type-2 AGN narrow-line regions from multiple survey spectra - a demonstration;;In the Letter, an interesting method is proposed to estimate size of narrow emission-lines regions (NLRs) of a type-2 AGN SDSS J083823.91 + 490241.1 (=SDSS J0838) at a redshift of 0.101, by comparing spectroscopic properties through the SDSS fibre (MJD = 51873) (diameter of 3 arcsec) and through the eBOSS fibre (MJD = 55277) (diameter of 2 arcsec). After subtractions of PPXF method determined host galaxy contributions, the narrow emission lines of SDSS J0838 in the SDSS spectrum and in the eBOSS spectrum can be well measured by Gaussian functions, leading more than 90 per cent of [O III] emissions to be covered by the eBOSS fibre with diameter of 2 arcsec. Meanwhile, both none broad emission components and none-variabilities of ZTF 3 yr-long g-/r-band light curves can be applied to confirm SDSS J0838 as a type-2 AGN, indicating few orientation effects on the projected NLRs size in SDSS J0838. Therefore, upper limit about 1 arcsec (2250 pc) of the NLRs size can be reasonably accepted in SDSS J0838. Combining with the intrinsic reddening corrected [O III] line luminosity, the upper limit of NLRs size in SDSS J0838 well lies within the 99.9999 per cent confidence bands of the R-L empirical relation for NLRs in AGN.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.2470Z
ASAS-SN follow-up of IceCube high-energy neutrino alerts;;We report on the search for optical counterparts to IceCube neutrino alerts released between 2016 April and 2021 August with the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN). Despite the discovery of a diffuse astrophysical high-energy neutrino flux in 2013, the source of those neutrinos remains largely unknown. Since 2016, IceCube has published likely astrophysical neutrinos as public real-time alerts. Through a combination of normal survey and triggered target-of-opportunity observations, ASAS-SN obtained images within 1 h of the neutrino detection for 20 per cent (11) of all observable IceCube alerts and within one day for another 57 per cent (32). For all observable alerts, we obtained images within at least two weeks from the neutrino alert. ASAS-SN provides the only optical follow-up for about 17 per cent of IceCube's neutrino alerts. We recover the two previously claimed counterparts to neutrino alerts, the flaring-blazar TXS 0506 + 056 and the tidal disruption event AT2019dsg. We investigate the light curves of previously detected transients in the alert footprints, but do not identify any further candidate neutrino sources. We also analysed the optical light curves of Fermi 4FGL sources coincident with high-energy neutrino alerts, but do not identify any contemporaneous flaring activity. Finally, we derive constraints on the luminosity functions of neutrino sources for a range of assumed evolution models.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.2455N
Close encounters of stars with stellar-mass black hole binaries;;Many astrophysical environments, from star clusters and globular clusters to the discs of active galactic nuclei, are characterized by frequent interactions between stars and the compact objects that they leave behind. Here, using a suite of 3D hydrodynamics simulations, we explore the outcome of close interactions between $1\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$ stars and binary black holes (BBHs) in the gravitational wave regime, resulting in a tidal disruption event (TDE) or a pure scattering, focusing on the accretion rates, the back reaction on the BH binary orbital parameters, and the increase in the binary BH effective spin. We find that TDEs can make a significant impact on the binary orbit, which is often different from that of a pure scattering. Binaries experiencing a prograde (retrograde) TDE tend to be widened (hardened) by up to $\simeq 20{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$. Initially circular binaries become more eccentric by $\lesssim 10{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ by a prograde or retrograde TDE, whereas the eccentricity of initially eccentric binaries increases (decreases) by a retrograde (prograde) TDE by $\lesssim 5{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$. Overall, a single TDE can generally result in changes of the gravitational-wave-driven merger time-scale by order unity. The accretion rates of both black holes are very highly super-Eddington, showing modulations (preferentially for retrograde TDEs) on a time-scale of the orbital period, which can be a characteristic feature of BBH-driven TDEs. Prograde TDEs result in the effective spin parameter χ to vary by ≲0.02, while χ ≳ -0.005 for retrograde TDEs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.2204R
A search for hot subdwarf binaries in data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite;;We present the results of a search for binary hot subdwarf stars in photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The sample of objects used in this work was a byproduct of another search for pulsating hot subdwarfs, which resulted in the discovery of nearly 400 non-pulsating variable candidates. The periodogram for each object was calculated and a frequency signal with one or more harmonics above the 4 σ detection threshold was used to consider the candidate as a possible binary system. The type of variability was subsequently confirmed by visual inspection. We present a list of 46 binary system candidates that were not previously known as binaries. We also analysed a few example light curves to demonstrate the importance of double checking the variability of the source in the TESS light curves corrected for instrumental signatures. Four objects, TIC 55753808, TIC 118412596, TIC 4999380, and TIC 68834079, which show variations in the TESS-calibrated fluxes, were actually found to be constant. We also found that it might be more appropriate to increase the commonly used 4σ detection threshold in order to avoid the detection of multiple spurious peaks in the periodograms or Fourier transform of the TESS light curves.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.1509K
Emergence of a new H I 21-cm absorption component at z   1.1726 towards the γ-ray blazar PKS 2355-106;;We report the emergence of a new H I 21-cm absorption at z<SUB>abs</SUB> = 1.172 635 in the damped Lyα absorber (DLA) towards the γ-ray blazar PKS 2355-106 (z<SUB>em</SUB>~1.639) using science verification observations (2020 June) from the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS). Since 2006, this DLA is known to show a narrow H I 21-cm absorption at z<SUB>abs</SUB> = 1.173019 coinciding with a distinct metal absorption-line component. We do not detect significant H I 21-cm optical depth variations from this known H I component. A high-resolution optical spectrum (2010 August) shows a distinct Mg I absorption at the redshift of the new H I 21-cm absorber. However, this component is not evident in the profiles of singly ionized species. We measure the metallicity ([Zn/H] = -(0.77 ± 0.11) and [Si/H]= -(0.96 ± 0.11)) and depletion ([Fe/Zn] = -(0.63 ± 0.16)) for the full system. Using the apparent column density profiles of Si II, Fe II, and Mg I, we show that the depletion and the N(Mg I)/N(Si II) column density ratio systematically vary across the velocity range. The region with high depletion tends to have a slightly larger N(Mg I)/N(Si II) ratio. The two H I 21-cm absorbers belong to this velocity range. The emergence of z<SUB>abs</SUB> = 1.172 635 can be understood if there is a large optical depth gradient over a length-scale of ~0.35 pc. However, the gas producing the z<SUB>abs</SUB> = 1.173 019 component must be nearly uniform over the same scale. Systematic uncertainties introduced by the absorption-line variability has to be accounted for in experiments measuring the variations of fundamental constants and cosmic acceleration even when the radio emission is apparently compact as in PKS 2355-106.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.1339S
The Zwicky Transient Facility phase I sample of hydrogen-rich superluminous supernovae without strong narrow emission lines;;We present a sample of 14 hydrogen-rich superluminous supernovae (SLSNe II) from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) between 2018 and 2020. We include all classified SLSNe with peaks M<SUB>g</SUB> < -20 mag with observed broad but not narrow Balmer emission, corresponding to roughly 20 per cent of all hydrogen-rich SLSNe in ZTF phase I. We examine the light curves and spectra of SLSNe II and attempt to constrain their power source using light-curve models. The brightest events are photometrically and spectroscopically similar to the prototypical SN 2008es, while others are found spectroscopically more reminiscent of non-superluminous SNe II, especially SNe II-L. <SUP>56</SUP>Ni decay as the primary power source is ruled out. Light-curve models generally cannot distinguish between circumstellar interaction (CSI) and a magnetar central engine, but an excess of ultraviolet (UV) emission signifying CSI is seen in most of the SNe with UV data, at a wide range of photometric properties. Simultaneously, the broad H α profiles of the brightest SLSNe II can be explained through electron scattering in a symmetric circumstellar medium (CSM). In other SLSNe II without narrow lines, the CSM may be confined and wholly overrun by the ejecta. CSI, possibly involving mass lost in recent eruptions, is implied to be the dominant power source in most SLSNe II, and the diversity in properties is likely the result of different mass loss histories. Based on their radiated energy, an additional power source may be required for the brightest SLSNe II, however - possibly a central engine combined with CSI.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.1193K
Four new deeply eclipsing white dwarfs in Zwicky Transient Facility;;We present the results of a search for deeply eclipsing white dwarfs in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 4 (DR4). We identify nine deeply eclipsing white dwarf candidates, four of which we followed up with high-cadence photometry and spectroscopy. Three of these systems show total eclipses in the ZTF data and our follow-up Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope observations. Even though the eclipse duration is consistent with sub-stellar companions, our analysis shows that all four systems contain a white dwarf with low-mass stellar companions of ~0.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We provide mass and radius constraints for both stars in each system based on our photometric and spectroscopic fitting. Finally, we present a list of 41 additional eclipsing WD+M candidates identified in a preliminary search of ZTF DR7, including 12 previously studied systems. We identify two new candidate short-period, eclipsing, white dwarf-brown dwarf binaries within our sample of 41 WD+M candidates based on Pan-STARRS colours.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516..720K
The fall of CSS100217: a tidal disruption-induced low state in an apparently hostless active galactic nucleus;;CSS100217 was a nuclear, rapid, and luminous flare in a narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy, whose initial interpretation as a supernova is now debated between variability of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) and a tidal disruption event (TDE). In this paper, we present and discuss new evidence in favour of a TDE or extreme flaring episode scenario. After the decay of the flare, the galaxy entered a long-term low luminosity state, 0.4 mag lower than the pre-outburst emission in the V band. We attribute this to the creation of a cavity in the accretion disc after the tidal disruption of a star in a retrograde orbit with respect to the accretion disc rotation, making a TDE our favoured interpretation of the flare. We also show how the host galaxy shows a point-like, compact profile, no evidence for an extended component and a relatively low mass, unlike what expected from an AGN host galaxy at z = 0.147. A compact host galaxy may result in an increased TDE rate, strengthening our interpretation of the event.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516..529C
GRANDMA observations of ZTF/Fink transients during summer 2021;;We present our follow-up observations with GRANDMA of transient sources revealed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Over a period of six months, all ZTF alerts were examined in real time by a dedicated science module implemented in the Fink broker, which will be used in filtering of transients discovered by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. In this article, we present three selection methods to identify kilonova candidates. Out of more than 35 million alerts, a hundred sources have passed our selection criteria. Six were then followed-up by GRANDMA (by both professional and amateur astronomers). The majority were finally classified either as asteroids or as supernovae events. We mobilized 37 telescopes, bringing together a large sample of images, taken under various conditions and quality. To complement the orphan kilonova candidates, we included three additional supernovae alerts to conduct further observations during summer 2021. We demonstrate the importance of the amateur astronomer community that contributed images for scientific analyses of new sources discovered in a magnitude range r' = 17 - 19 mag. We based our rapid kilonova classification on the decay rate of the optical source that should exceed 0.3 mag d<SUP>-1</SUP>. GRANDMA's follow-up determined the fading rate within 1.5 ± 1.2 d post-discovery, without waiting for further observations from ZTF. No confirmed kilonovae were discovered during our observing campaign. This work will be continued in the coming months in the view of preparing for kilonova searches in the next gravitational-wave observing run O4.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.6007A
Photometric variability in star-forming galaxies as evidence for low-mass AGN and a precursor to quenching;;We measure the optical variability in ~16 500 low-redshift (z ~ 0.1) galaxies to map the relations between active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and galaxy stellar mass, specific star formation rate, half-light radius, and bulge-to-total ratio. To do this, we use a reduced χ<SUP>2</SUP> variability measure on >10 epoch light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility and combine with spectroscopic data and derive galaxy parameters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that below the stellar mass of 10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, galaxies classed as star-forming via the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram have higher mean variabilities than AGN or composite galaxies. Revealingly, the highest mean variabilities occur in star-forming galaxies in a narrow range of specific star formation rate: -11 < log(sSFR/yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) < -10. In very actively star-forming galaxies [log(sSFR/yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) > -10], the reduced variability implies a lack of instantaneous correlation with star formation rate. Our results may indicate that a high level of variability, and thus black hole growth, acts as a precursor for reduced star formation, bulge growth, and revealed AGN-like emission lines. These results add to the mounting evidence that optical variability can act as a viable tracer for low-mass AGNs and that such AGNs can strongly affect their host galaxy.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.5905C
The moving mirror model for fast radio bursts;;Recent observations of coherent radiation from the Crab pulsar suggest the emission is driven by an ultrarelativistic (γ ~ 10<SUP>4</SUP>), cold plasma flow. A relativistically expanding plasma shell can compress the ambient magnetic field, like a moving mirror, and thus produce coherent radiation whose wavelength is shorter than that of the ambient medium by γ<SUP>2</SUP>. This mechanism has been previously studied in the context of radio loud supernova explosions. In this work, we propose that a similar mechanism drives the coherent emission in fast radio bursts. The high Lorenz factors dramatically lower the implied energy and magnetic field requirements, allowing the spin-down energy of regular (or even recycled), fast spinning pulsars, rather than slow spinning magnetars, to explain FRBs. We show that this model can explain the frequency and the time evolution of observed FRBs, as well as their duration, energetics, and absence of panchromatic counterparts. We also predict that the peak frequency of subpulses decline with observation time as $\omega _{\rm obs} \propto t_{\rm obs}^{-1/2}$. Unfortunately, with current capabilities it is not possible to constrain the shape of the curve ω<SUB>obs</SUB>(t<SUB>obs</SUB>). Finally, we find that a variation of this model can explain weaker radio transients, such as the one observed from a galactic magnetar. In this variant, the shock wave produces low-frequency photons that are then Compton scattered to the GHz range.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.5682Y
Systematic light-curve modelling of TDEs: statistical differences between the spectroscopic classes;;With the sample of observed tidal disruption events (TDEs) now reaching several tens, distinct spectroscopic classes have emerged: TDEs with only hydrogen lines (TDE-H), only helium lines (TDE-He), or hydrogen in combination with He II and often N III/O III (TDE-H + He). Here, we model the light curves of 32 optically bright TDEs using the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients (MOSFIT) to estimate physical and orbital properties, and look for statistical differences between the spectroscopic classes. For all types, we find a shallow distribution of star masses, compared to a typical initial mass function, in the range ~0.1-1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and no TDEs with very deep encounters. Our main result is that TDE-H events appear to come from less complete disruptions (and possibly lower SMBH masses) than TDE-H+He, with TDE-He events fully disrupted. We also find that TDE-H events have more extended photospheres, in agreement with recent literature, and argue that this could be a consequence of differences in the self-intersection radii of the debris streams. Finally, we identify an approximately linear correlation between black hole mass and radiative efficiency. We suggest that TDE-H may be powered by collision-induced outflows at relatively large radii, while TDE-H + He could result from prompt accretion discs, formed more efficiently in closer encounters around more massive SMBHs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.5604N
An X-ray view of the ambiguous nuclear transient AT2019pev;;AT2019pev is a nuclear transient in a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy at z = 0.096. The archival ultraviolet, optical, and infrared data showed features of both tidal disruption events and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and its nature is not fully understood. We present detailed X-ray observations of AT2019pev taken with Swift, Chandra, and NICER over 173 d of its evolution since the first Swift XRT epoch. The X-ray luminosity increases by a factor of 5 in 5 d from the first Swift XRT epoch to the light-curve peak. The light curve decays by a factor of 10 over ~75 d and then flattens with a weak re-brightening trend at late times. The X-ray spectra show a 'harder-when-brighter' trend before peak and a 'harder-when-fainter' trend after peak, which may indicate a transition of accretion states. The archival ground-based optical observations show similar time evolution as the X-ray light curves. Beyond the seasonal limit of the ground-based observations, the Gaia light curve is rising towards an equally bright or brighter peak 223 d after the optical discovery. Combining our X-ray analysis and archival multiwavelength data, AT2019pev more closely resembles an AGN transient.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.5198Y
All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory eXplorer mission concept;;The All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory eXplorer (AMEGO-X) is designed to identify and characterize gamma rays from extreme explosions and accelerators. The main science themes include supermassive black holes and their connections to neutrinos and cosmic rays; binary neutron star mergers and the relativistic jets they produce; cosmic ray particle acceleration sources including galactic supernovae; continuous monitoring of other astrophysical events and sources over the full sky in this important energy range. AMEGO-X will probe the medium energy gamma-ray band using a single instrument with sensitivity up to an order of magnitude greater than previous telescopes in the energy range 100 keV to 1 GeV that can be only realized in space. During its 3-year baseline mission, AMEGO-X will observe nearly the entire sky every two orbits, building up a sensitive all-sky map of gamma-ray sources and emissions. AMEGO-X was submitted in the recent 2021 NASA MIDEX announcement of opportunity.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JATIS...8d4003C
The LSST Era of Supermassive Black Hole Accretion Disk Reverberation Mapping;;The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will detect an unprecedentedly large sample of actively accreting supermassive black holes with typical accretion disk (AD) sizes of a few light days. This brings us to face challenges in the reverberation mapping (RM) measurement of AD sizes in active galactic nuclei using interband continuum delays. We examine the effect of LSST cadence strategies on AD RM using our metric AGN_TimeLagMetric. It accounts for redshift, cadence, the magnitude limit, and magnitude corrections for dust extinction. Running our metric on different LSST cadence strategies, we produce an atlas of the performance estimations for LSST photometric RM measurements. We provide an upper limit on the estimated number of quasars for which the AD time lag can be computed within 0 < z < 7 using the features of our metric. We forecast that the total counts of such objects will increase as the mean sampling rate of the survey decreases. The AD time lag measurements are expected for >1000 sources in each deep drilling field (DDF; (10 deg<SUP>2</SUP>)) in any filter, with the redshift distribution of these sources peaking at z ≈ 1. We find the LSST observation strategies with a good cadence (≲5 days) and a long cumulative season (~9 yr), as proposed for LSST DDF, are favored for the AD size measurement. We create synthetic LSST light curves for the most suitable DDF cadences and determine RM time lags to demonstrate the impact of the best cadences based on the proposed metric.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..262...49K
Kilonova and Optical Afterglow from Binary Neutron Star Mergers. I. Luminosity Function and Color Evolution;;In the first work of this series, we adopt a GW170817-like viewing-angle-dependent kilonova model and the standard afterglow model with a light-curve distribution based on the properties of cosmological short gamma-ray burst afterglows to simulate the luminosity functions and color evolution of both kilonovae and optical afterglow emissions from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. We find that ~10% of the nearly-on-axis afterglows are brighter than the associated kilonovae at the peak time. These kilonovae would be significantly polluted by the associated afterglow emission. Only at large viewing angles with $\sin {\theta }_{{\rm{v}}}rsim 0.20$ , the electromagnetic signals of most BNS mergers would be kilonova-dominated and some off-axis afterglows may emerge at ~5-10 days after the mergers. At a brightness dimmer than ~23-24 mag, according to their luminosity functions, the number of afterglows is much larger than that of kilonovae. Because the search depth of the present survey projects is <22 mag, the number of afterglow events that are detected via serendipitous observations would be much higher than that of kilonova events, consistent with the current observations. For the foreseeable survey projects (e.g., Mephisto, WFST, and LSST), whose search depths can reach ≳23-24 mag, the detection rate of kilonovae could have the same order of magnitude as afterglows. We also find that it may be difficult to use the fading rate in a single band to directly identify kilonovae and afterglows among various fast-evolving transients by serendipitous surveys. However, the color evolution between the optical and infrared bands can identify them because the color evolution patterns of these phenomena are unique compared with those of other fast-evolving transients.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938..147Z
The Pantheon+ Analysis: The Full Data Set and Light-curve Release;;Here we present 1701 light curves of 1550 unique, spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) that will be used to infer cosmological parameters as part of the Pantheon+ SN analysis and the Supernovae and H <SUB>0</SUB> for the Equation of State of dark energy distance-ladder analysis. This effort is one part of a series of works that perform an extensive review of redshifts, peculiar velocities, photometric calibration, and intrinsic-scatter models of SNe Ia. The total number of light curves, which are compiled across 18 different surveys, is a significant increase from the first Pantheon analysis (1048 SNe), particularly at low redshift (z). Furthermore, unlike in the Pantheon analysis, we include light curves for SNe with z < 0.01 such that SN systematic covariance can be included in a joint measurement of the Hubble constant (H <SUB>0</SUB>) and the dark energy equation-of-state parameter (w). We use the large sample to compare properties of 151 SNe Ia observed by multiple surveys and 12 pairs/triplets of "SN siblings"-SNe found in the same host galaxy. Distance measurements, application of bias corrections, and inference of cosmological parameters are discussed in the companion paper by Brout et al., and the determination of H <SUB>0</SUB> is discussed by Riess et al. These analyses will measure w with ~3% precision and H <SUB>0</SUB> with ~1 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> precision.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938..113S
The Pantheon+ Analysis: SuperCal-fragilistic Cross Calibration, Retrained SALT2 Light-curve Model, and Calibration Systematic Uncertainty;;We present a recalibration of the photometric systems in the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) including those in the SH0ES distance-ladder measurement of H <SUB>0</SUB>. We utilize the large and uniform sky coverage of the public Pan-STARRS stellar photometry catalog to cross calibrate against tertiary standards released by individual SN Ia surveys. The most significant updates over the "SuperCal" cross calibration used for the previous Pantheon and SH0ES analyses are: (1) expansion of the number of photometric systems (now 25) and filters (now 105), (2) solving for all filter offsets in all systems simultaneously to produce a calibration uncertainty covariance matrix for cosmological-model constraints, and (3) accounting for the change in the fundamental flux calibration of the Hubble Space Telescope CALSPEC standards from previous versions on the order of 1.5% over a Δλ of 4000 Å. We retrain the SALT2 model and find that our new model coupled with the new calibration of the light curves themselves causes a net distance modulus change (d μ/dz) of 0.04 mag over the redshift range 0 < z < 1. We introduce a new formalism to determine the systematic impact on cosmological inference by propagating the covariance in the fitted calibration offsets through retraining simultaneously with light-curve fitting and find a total calibration uncertainty impact of σ <SUB> w </SUB> = 0.013; roughly half the size of the sample statistical uncertainty. Similarly, we find the systematic SN calibration contribution to the SH0ES H <SUB>0</SUB> uncertainty is less than 0.2 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>, suggesting that SN Ia calibration cannot resolve the current level of the "Hubble Tension.";;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938..111B
The Pantheon+ Analysis: Cosmological Constraints;;We present constraints on cosmological parameters from the Pantheon+ analysis of 1701 light curves of 1550 distinct Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) ranging in redshift from z = 0.001 to 2.26. This work features an increased sample size from the addition of multiple cross-calibrated photometric systems of SNe covering an increased redshift span, and improved treatments of systematic uncertainties in comparison to the original Pantheon analysis, which together result in a factor of 2 improvement in cosmological constraining power. For a flat ΛCDM model, we find Ω<SUB> M </SUB> = 0.334 ± 0.018 from SNe Ia alone. For a flat w <SUB>0</SUB>CDM model, we measure w <SUB>0</SUB> = -0.90 ± 0.14 from SNe Ia alone, H <SUB>0</SUB> = 73.5 ± 1.1 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> when including the Cepheid host distances and covariance (SH0ES), and w <SUB>0</SUB> = $-{0.978}_{-0.031}^{+0.024}$ when combining the SN likelihood with Planck constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO); both w <SUB>0</SUB> values are consistent with a cosmological constant. We also present the most precise measurements to date on the evolution of dark energy in a flat w <SUB>0</SUB> w <SUB> a </SUB>CDM universe, and measure w <SUB> a </SUB> = $-{0.1}_{-2.0}^{+0.9}$ from Pantheon+ SNe Ia alone, H <SUB>0</SUB> = 73.3 ± 1.1 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> when including SH0ES Cepheid distances, and w <SUB> a </SUB> = $-{0.65}_{-0.32}^{+0.28}$ when combining Pantheon+ SNe Ia with CMB and BAO data. Finally, we find that systematic uncertainties in the use of SNe Ia along the distance ladder comprise less than one-third of the total uncertainty in the measurement of H <SUB>0</SUB> and cannot explain the present "Hubble tension" between local measurements and early universe predictions from the cosmological model.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938..110B
Cosmological Fast Optical Transients with the Zwicky Transient Facility: A Search for Dirty Fireballs;;Dirty fireballs are a hypothesized class of relativistic massive-star explosions with an initial Lorentz factor Γ<SUB>init</SUB> below the Γ<SUB>init</SUB> ~ 100 required to produce a long-duration gamma-ray burst (LGRB), but which could still produce optical emission resembling LGRB afterglows. Here we present the results of a search for on-axis optical afterglows using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Our search yielded seven optical transients that resemble on-axis LGRB afterglows in terms of their red colors (g - r > 0 mag), faint host galaxies (r > 23 mag), rapid fading (dr/dt > 1 mag day<SUP>-1</SUP>), and in some cases X-ray and radio emission. Spectroscopy of the transient emission within a few days of discovery established cosmological distances (redshift z = 0.876 to 2.9) for six of the seven events, tripling the number of afterglows with redshift measurements discovered by optical surveys without a γ-ray trigger. A likely associated LGRB (GRB 200524A, GRB 210204A, GRB 210212B, and GRB 210610B) was identified for four events (ZTF 20abbiixp/AT 2020kym, ZTF 21aagwbjr/AT 2021buv, ZTF 21aakruew/AT 2021cwd, and ZTF 21abfmpwn/AT 2021qbd) post facto, while three (ZTF 20aajnksq/AT 2020blt, ZTF 21aaeyldq/AT 2021any, and ZTF 21aayokph/AT 2021lfa) had no detected LGRB counterpart. The simplest explanation for the three "orphan" events is that they were regular LGRBs missed by high-energy satellites owing to detector sensitivity and duty cycle, although it is possible that they were intrinsically subluminous in γ-rays or viewed slightly off-axis. We rule out a scenario in which dirty fireballs have a similar energy per solid angle to LGRBs and are an order of magnitude more common. In addition, we set the first direct constraint on the ratio of the opening angles of the material producing γ-rays and the material producing early optical afterglow emission, finding that they must be comparable.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...85H
Radio Analysis of SN2004C Reveals an Unusual CSM Density Profile as a Harbinger of Core Collapse;;We present extensive multifrequency Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of the radio-bright supernova (SN) IIb SN 2004C that span ~40-2793 days post-explosion. We interpret the temporal evolution of the radio spectral energy distribution in the context of synchrotron self-absorbed emission from the explosion's forward shock as it expands in the circumstellar medium (CSM) previously sculpted by the mass-loss history of the stellar progenitor. VLBA observations and modeling of the VLA data point to a blastwave with average velocity ~0.06 c that carries an energy of ≈10<SUP>49</SUP> erg. Our modeling further reveals a flat CSM density profile ρ <SUB>CSM</SUB> ∝ R <SUP>-0.03±0.22</SUP> up to a break radius R <SUB>br</SUB> ≈ (1.96 ± 0.10) × 10<SUP>16</SUP> cm, with a steep density gradient following ρ <SUB>CSM</SUB> ∝ R <SUP>-2.3±0.5</SUP> at larger radii. We infer that the flat part of the density profile corresponds to a CSM shell with mass ~0.021 M <SUB>☉</SUB>, and that the progenitor's effective mass-loss rate varied with time over the range (50-500) × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> M <SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for an adopted wind velocity v <SUB> w </SUB> = 1000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and shock microphysical parameters ϵ <SUB> e </SUB> = 0.1, ϵ <SUB> B </SUB> = 0.01. These results add to the mounting observational evidence for departures from the traditional single-wind mass-loss scenarios in evolved, massive stars in the centuries leading up to core collapse. Potentially viable scenarios include mass loss powered by gravity waves and/or interaction with a binary companion.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...84D
Binaries with Possible Compact Components Discovered from the LAMOST Time-domain Survey of Four K2 Plates;;Time-domain spectroscopic data from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) can provide accurate and high-cadence radial velocities (RVs). In this work, we search for binaries with compact components with the RV monitoring method by using the LAMOST time-domain survey of four K2 plates. Three binary systems including an unseen white dwarf or neutron star are found. For each binary system, we estimate the stellar parameters of the visible star and orbital parameters, and finally calculate the binary mass function and the minimum mass of the unseen star. No obvious double-lined feature is seen from the LAMOST medium-resolution spectra of the three sources. In addition, we found no X-ray counterpart for all these sources but UV companions for two of them. Spectral disentangling also shows no additional component with optical absorption spectra, supporting that these systems contain compact objects.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...78L
The Diverse Properties of Type Icn Supernovae Point to Multiple Progenitor Channels;;We present a sample of Type Icn supernovae (SNe Icn), a newly discovered class of transients characterized by their interaction with H- and He-poor circumstellar material (CSM). This sample is the largest collection of SNe Icn to date and includes observations of two published objects (SN 2019hgp and SN 2021csp) and two objects not yet published in the literature (SN 2019jc and SN 2021ckj). The SNe Icn display a range of peak luminosities, rise times, and decline rates, as well as diverse late-time spectral features. To investigate their explosion and progenitor properties, we fit their bolometric light curves to a semianalytical model consisting of luminosity inputs from circumstellar interaction and radioactive decay of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni. We infer low ejecta masses (≲2 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) and <SUP>56</SUP>Ni masses (≲0.04 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) from the light curves, suggesting that normal stripped-envelope supernova (SESN) explosions within a dense CSM cannot be the underlying mechanism powering SNe Icn. Additionally, we find that an estimate of the star formation rate density at the location of SN 2019jc lies at the lower end of a distribution of SESNe, in conflict with a massive star progenitor of this object. Based on its estimated ejecta mass, <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass, and explosion site properties, we suggest a low-mass, ultra-stripped star as the progenitor of SN 2019jc. For other SNe Icn, we suggest that a Wolf-Rayet star progenitor may better explain their observed properties. This study demonstrates that multiple progenitor channels may produce SNe Icn and other interaction-powered transients.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...73P
Probe for Type Ia Supernova Progenitor in Decihertz Gravitational Wave Astronomy;;It is generally believed that Type Ia supernovae are thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (WDs). However, there is currently no consensus regarding the events leading to the explosion. A binary WD (WD-WD) merger is a possible progenitor of Type Ia supernovae. Space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors with considerable sensitivity in the decihertz range such as the DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) can observe WD-WD mergers directly. Therefore, access to the decihertz band of GWs would enable multi-messenger observations of Type Ia supernovae to determine their progenitors and explosion mechanism. In this paper, we consider the event rate of WD-WD mergers and the minimum detection range to observe one WD-WD merger per year, using a nearby galaxy catalog and the relation between Ia supernovae and their host galaxies. Furthermore, we calculate DECIGO's ability to localize WD-WD mergers and to determine the masses of binary mergers. We estimate that a decihertz GW observatory can detect GWs with amplitudes of h ~ 10<SUP>-20</SUP> [Hz<SUP>-1/2</SUP>] at 0.01-0.1 Hz, which is 1000 times higher than the detection limit of DECIGO. Assuming the progenitors of Ia supernovae are merging WD-WD (1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> and 0.8 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>), DECIGO is expected to detect 6600 WD-WD mergers within z = 0.08, and identify the host galaxies of such WD-WD mergers within z ~ 0.065 using GW detections alone.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...52K
Informing the Cataclysmic Variable Sequence from Gaia Data: The Orbital-period-Color-Absolute-magnitude Relationship;;The orbital-period (P <SUB>orb</SUB>) gap in the population of cataclysmic variables (CVs) informs the theoretical narrative of CV evolution, yet a complete understanding of the driving angular momentum loss mechanisms above and below this gap remains elusive. Here we identify, for standard CVs, a new, apparently monotonic relationship between quiescent color (G <SUB>BP</SUB>-G <SUB>RP</SUB>), absolute magnitude (M <SUB> G </SUB>), and P <SUB>orb</SUB> (between 70 minutes and 8 hr) revealed in Gaia DR2 and EDR3. We show that P <SUB>orb</SUB> increases in the color-absolute-magnitude diagram roughly orthogonally to the white dwarf and main sequences. We find the orbital-period-color-absolute-magnitude relationship to be stable across different CV subtypes: dwarf novae, intermediate polars, polars, and novalike systems. We place our findings in context with the known semiempirical donor sequence for CVs and find a dependence between color and M <SUB> G </SUB> for a given P <SUB>orb</SUB> specifically for dwarf novae and intermediate polars above the period gap. These relations have the potential to inform a more complete picture of CV evolution.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...46A
Transient Radio Emission from Low-redshift Galaxies at z < 0.3 Revealed by the VLASS and FIRST Surveys;;We present the discovery of a sample of 18 low-redshift (z < 0.3) galaxies with transient nuclear radio emission. These galaxies are not detected or are weakly detected in the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey, performed from 1993-2009, but have brightened significantly in radio flux (by a factor of ≳5) in the epoch I (2017-2019) observations of the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). All 18 galaxies have been detected in VLASS epoch II observations, from 2020-2021, from which the radio flux has been found to evolve slowly (with variability amplitudes of ≳40%) over a period of about 3 yr. 15 galaxies have been observed in the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey, and a flat or inverted spectral slope between 888 MHz and 3 GHz is found. Based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra taken before the radio brightening, 14 of the 18 galaxies can be classified as LINERs or normal galaxies with weak or no nuclear activity. Most galaxies are red and massive, with more than half having central black hole masses above 10<SUP>8</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We find that only one galaxy in our sample displays an optical flare lasting for at least two months, with a long decay in the infrared light curve that can be explained as the dust-heated echo emission of a central optical flare, such as a stellar tidal disruption event. We discuss several possibilities for the transient radio emission and conclude that it is likely associated with a newborn radio jet triggered by short sporadic fueling of a supermassive black hole. Such a scenario can be tested with further multifrequency radio observations of these sources, via measuring their radio flux variability and spectral evolution.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...43Z
Variable Star Classification with a Multiple-input Neural Network;;In this experiment, we created a Multiple-Input Neural Network, consisting of convolutional and multilayer neural networks. With this setup the selected highest-performing neural network was able to distinguish variable stars based on the visual characteristics of their light curves, while taking also into account additional numerical information (e.g., period, reddening-free brightness) to differentiate visually similar light curves. The network was trained and tested on Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment-III (OGLE-III) data using all OGLE-III observation fields, phase-folded light curves, and period data. The neural network yielded accuracies of 89%-99% for most of the main classes (Cepheids, δ Scutis, eclipsing binaries, RR Lyrae stars, Type-II Cepheids), only the first-overtone anomalous Cepheids had an accuracy of 45%. To counteract the large confusion between the first-overtone anomalous Cepheids and the RRab stars we added the reddening-free brightness as a new input and only stars from the LMC field were retained to have a fixed distance. With this change we improved the neural network's result for the first-overtone anomalous Cepheids to almost 80%. Overall, the Multiple-input Neural Network method developed by our team is a promising alternative to existing classification methods.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...37S
A Mildly Relativistic Outflow Launched Two Years after Disruption in Tidal Disruption Event AT2018hyz;;We present late-time radio/millimeter (as well as optical/UV and X-ray) detections of tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2018hyz, spanning 970-1300 d after optical discovery. In conjunction with earlier deeper limits, including those at ≈700 days, our observations reveal rapidly rising emission at 0.8-240 GHz, steeper than F <SUB> ν </SUB> ∝ t <SUP>5</SUP> relative to the time of optical discovery. Such a steep rise cannot be explained in any reasonable scenario of an outflow launched at the time of disruption (e.g., off-axis jet, sudden increase in the ambient density), and instead points to a delayed launch. Our multifrequency data allow us to directly determine the radius and energy of the radio-emitting outflow, and we find from our modeling that the outflow was launched ≈750 days after optical discovery. The outflow velocity is mildly relativistic, with β ≈ 0.25 and ≈0.6 for a spherical geometry and a 10° jet geometry, respectively, and the minimum kinetic energy is E <SUB> K </SUB> ≈ 5.8 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> and ≈6.3 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> erg, respectively. This is the first definitive evidence for the production of a delayed mildly relativistic outflow in a TDE; a comparison to the recently published radio light curve of ASASSN-15oi suggests that the final rebrightening observed in that event (at a single frequency and time) may be due to a similar outflow with a comparable velocity and energy. Finally, we note that the energy and velocity of the delayed outflow in AT2018hyz are intermediate between those of past nonrelativistic TDEs (e.g., ASASSN-14li, AT2019dsg) and the relativistic TDE Sw J1644+57. We suggest that such delayed outflows may be common in TDEs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...28C
MEGASIM: Lifetimes and Resonances of Earth Trojan Asteroids-The Death of Primordial ETAs?;;We present an analysis of lifetimes and resonances of Earth Trojan Asteroids (ETAs) in the MEGASIM data set. Trojan asteroids co-orbit the Sun with a planet, but remain bound to the Lagrange points, L4 (60° leading the planet) or L5 (60° trailing). In the circular three-body approximation, the stability of a Trojan asteroid depends on the ratio of the host planet mass and the central mass. For the inner planets, the range of stability becomes increasingly small, so perturbations from the planets have made primordial Trojans rare. To date, there have been just two ETAs (2010 TK<SUB>7</SUB> and 2020 XL<SUB>5</SUB>), several Mars Trojans, and a Venus Trojan discovered. The estimated lifetimes of the known inner system Trojans are shorter than a million years, suggesting they are interlopers rather than members of a stable and long-lasting population. With the largest ETA n-body simulation to date, we are able to track their survival across a wide initialized parameter space. We find that the remaining fraction of ETAs over time is well fit with a stretched exponential function that, when extrapolated beyond our simulation run time, predicts zero ETAs by 2.33 Gyr. We also show correlations between ETA ejections and the periods of the Milankovitch cycles. Though Earth's orbital dynamics dominate the instabilities of ETAs, we provide evidence that ETA ejections are linked to resonances found in the variation of the orbital elements of many if not all of the planets.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938....9Y
Dynamical Unification of Tidal Disruption Events;;The ~100 tidal disruption events (TDEs) observed so far exhibit a wide range of emission properties both at peak and over their lifetimes. Some TDEs radiate predominantly at X-ray energies, while others radiate chiefly at UV and optical wavelengths. While the peak luminosities across TDEs show distinct properties, the evolutionary behavior can also vary between TDEs with similar peak emission properties. In particular, for optical TDEs, while their UV and optical emissions decline somewhat following the fallback pattern, some events can greatly rebrighten in X-rays at late time. In this Letter, we conduct three-dimensional general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of TDE accretion disks at varying accretion rates in the regime of super-Eddington accretion. We make use of Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations to calculate the reprocessed spectra at various inclinations and at different evolutionary stages. We confirm the unified model proposed by Dai et al., which predicts that the observed emission largely depends on the viewing angle of the observer with respect to the disk orientation. Furthermore, we find that disks with higher accretion rates have elevated wind and disk densities, which increases the reprocessing of the high-energy radiation and thus generally augments the optical-to-X-ray flux ratio along a particular viewing angle. This implies that at later times, as the accretion level declines, we expect that more X-rays will leak out along intermediate viewing angles. Such dynamical model for TDEs can provide a natural explanation for the diversity in the emission properties observed in TDEs at peak and along their temporal evolution.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...937L..28T
Identifying High-energy Neutrino Transients by Neutrino Multiplet-triggered Follow-ups;;Transient sources such as supernovae (SNe) and tidal disruption events are candidates of high-energy neutrino sources. However, SNe commonly occur in the universe and a chance coincidence of their detection with a neutrino signal cannot be avoided, which may lead to a challenge of claiming their association with neutrino emission. In order to overcome this difficulty, we propose a search for ~10-100 TeV multiple neutrino events within a timescale of ~30 days coming from the same direction, called neutrino multiplets. We show that demanding multiplet detection by a ~1 km<SUP>3</SUP> neutrino telescope limits the distances of detectable neutrino sources, which enables us to identify source counterparts by multiwavelength observations owing to the substantially reduced rate of the chance coincidence detection of transients. We apply our results by constructing a feasible strategy for optical follow-up observations and demonstrate that wide-field optical telescopes with a ≳4 m dish should be capable of identifying a transient associated with a neutrino multiplet. We also present the resultant sensitivity of multiplet neutrino detection as a function of the released energy of neutrinos and burst rate density. A model of neutrino transient sources with an emission energy greater than a few × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg and a burst rate rarer than a few ×10<SUP>-8</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> is constrained by the null detection of multiplets by a ~1 km<SUP>3</SUP> scale neutrino telescope. This already disfavors the canonical high-luminosity gamma-ray bursts and jetted tidal disruption events as major sources in the TeV-energy neutrino sky.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...937..108Y
A Deep and Wide Twilight Survey for Asteroids Interior to Earth and Venus;;We are conducting a survey using twilight time on the Dark Energy Camera with the Blanco 4 m telescope in Chile to look for objects interior to Earth's and Venus' orbits. To date we have discovered two rare Atira/Apohele asteroids, 2021 LJ4 and 2021 PH27, which have orbits completely interior to Earth's orbit. We also discovered one new Apollo-type Near Earth Object (NEO) that crosses Earth's orbit, 2022 AP7. Two of the discoveries have diameters ≳1 km. 2022 AP7 is likely the largest Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (PHA) discovered in about eight years. To date we have covered 624 square degrees of sky near to and interior to the orbit of Venus. The average images go to 21.3 mag in the r band, with the best images near 22nd mag. Our new discovery 2021 PH27 has the smallest semimajor axis known for an asteroid, 0.4617 au, and the largest general relativistic effects (53 arcsec/century) known for any body in the solar system. The survey has detected ~15% of all known Atira NEOs. We put strong constraints on any stable population of Venus co-orbital resonance objects existing, as well as the Atira and Vatira asteroid classes. These interior asteroid populations are important to complete the census of asteroids near Earth, including some of the most likely Earth impactors that cannot easily be discovered in other surveys. Comparing the actual population of asteroids found interior to Earth and Venus with those predicted to exist by extrapolating from the known population exterior to Earth is important to better understand the origin, composition, and structure of the NEO population.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..168S
Implications for the Collisional Strength of Jupiter Trojans from the Eurybates Family;;In this work, we model the collisional evolution of the Jupiter Trojans and determine under which conditions the Eurybates-Queta system survives. We show that the collisional strength of the Jupiter Trojans and the age of the Eurybates family and by extension Queta are correlated. The collisional grinding of the Jupiter Trojan population over 4.5 Gy results in a size-frequency distribution (SFD) that remains largely unaltered at large sizes (>10 km) but is depleted at small sizes (10 m to 1 km). This results in a turnover in the SFD, the location of which depends on the collisional strength of the material. It is to be expected that the Trojan SFD bends between 1 and 10 km. Based on the SFD of the Eurybates family, we find that the family was likely the result of a catastrophic impact onto a 100 km rubble pile target. This corresponds to objects with a rather low collisional strength (10 times weaker than that of basaltic material studied in Benz & Asphaug). Assuming this weak strength, and an initial cumulative slope of the size-frequency distribution of 2.1 between diameters of 2 m and 100 km when the Trojans were captured, the existence of Queta, the satellite of Eurybates, implies an upper limit for the family age of 3.7 Gy. Alternatively, we demonstrate that an unconventional collisional strength with a minimum at 20 m is a plausible candidate to ensure the survival of Queta over the age of the solar system. Finally, we show how different collisional histories change the expected number of craters on the targets of the Lucy mission and that Lucy will be able to differentiate between them.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..167M
Zwicky Transient Facility and Globular Clusters: Calibration of the gr-band Absolute Magnitudes for the Yellow Post-asymptotic-giant-branch Stars;;We present the first absolute calibration for the yellow post-asymptotic-giant-branch (PAGB) stars in the g and r band based on time-series observations from the Zwicky Transient Facility. These absolute magnitudes were calibrated using four yellow PAGB stars (one nonvarying star and three Type II Cepheids) located in the globular clusters. We provide two calibrations of the gr-band absolute magnitudes for the yellow PAGB stars, by using an arithmetic mean and a linear regression. We demonstrate that the linear regression provides a better fit to the g-band absolute magnitudes for the yellow PAGB stars. These calibrated gr-band absolute magnitudes have a potential to be used as Population II distance indicators in the era of time-domain synoptic sky surveys.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..166N
Double-mode Cepheids from the Zwicky Transient Facility Survey;;Multimode Cepheids pulsate simultaneously in more than one mode of oscillation. They provide an independent means to test stellar models and pulsation theories. They can also be used to derive metallicities. In recent years, the number of known multimode Cepheids has increased dramatically with the discovery of a large number of Galactic double-mode Cepheids. To date, 209 double-mode Cepheids have been detected in the Galactic bulge and disk, mostly based on the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment's (OGLE) catalog. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive search for double-mode Cepheids in the northern sky based on Zwicky Transient Facility Data Release 5. We found 72 such objects in the Milky Way. The periods of the 30 sample objects already included in the OGLE catalog show excellent agreement with the OGLE periods. The period ratios of our new Cepheids are consistent with those of known double-mode Cepheids, as evidenced by their loci in the so-called "Petersen diagram." Compared with OGLE, the completeness of our double-mode Cepheid sample is around 71%. The much improved temporal sampling of the Zwicky Transient Facility offers significant scope to find more double-mode Cepheids, especially at the distribution's short-period end.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..162S
Zwicky Transient Facility and Globular Clusters: The Period-Luminosity and Period-Wesenheit Relations for Type II Cepheids;;We present the first gri-band period-luminosity (PL) and period-Wesenheit (PW) relations for 37 Type II Cepheids (TIICs) located in 18 globular clusters based on photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We also updated BVIJHK-band absolute magnitudes for 58 TIICs in 24 globular clusters using the latest homogeneous distances to the globular clusters. The slopes of g/r/i- and B/V/I-band PL relations are found to be statistically consistent when using the same sample of distance and reddening. We employed the calibration of ri-band PL/PW relations in globular clusters to estimate a distance to M31 based on a sample of ~270 TIICs from the PAndromeda project. The distance modulus to M31, obtained using calibrated ri-band PW relation, agrees well with the recent determination based on classical Cepheids. However, distance moduli derived using the calibrated r- and i-band PL relations are systematically smaller by ~0.2 mag, suggesting there are possible additional systematic errors on the PL relations. Finally, we also derive the period-color (PC) relations and for the first time the period-Q-index (PQ) relations, where the Q-index is reddening free, for our sample of TIICs. The PC relations based on (r - i) and near-infrared colors and the PQ relations are found to be relatively independent of the pulsation periods.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..154N
The Rapid Rotation of the Strongly Magnetic Ultramassive White Dwarf EGGR 156;;The distribution of white dwarf rotation periods provides a means for constraining angular momentum evolution during the late stages of stellar evolution, as well as insight into the physics and remnants of double degenerate mergers. Although the rotational distribution of low-mass white dwarfs is relatively well constrained via asteroseismology, that of high-mass white dwarfs, which can arise from either intermediate-mass stellar evolution or white dwarf mergers, is not. Photometric variability in white dwarfs due to rotation of a spotted star is rapidly increasing the sample size of high-mass white dwarfs with measured rotation periods. We present the discovery of 22.4 minute photometric variability in the light curve of EGGR 156, a strongly magnetic, ultramassive white dwarf. We interpret this variability as rapid rotation, and our data suggest that EGGR 156 is the remnant of a double degenerate merger. Finally, we calculate the rate of period change in rapidly-rotating, massive, magnetic WDs due to magnetic dipole radiation. In many cases, including EGGR 156, the period change is not currently detectable over reasonable timescales, indicating that these WDs could be very precise clocks. For the most highly-magnetic, rapidly-rotating massive WDs, such as ZTF J1901+1450 and RE J0317-853, the period change should be detectable and may help constrain the structure and evolution of these exotic white dwarfs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..131W
Impact simulation of Starlink satellites on astronomical observation using worldwide telescope;;Along with the generalization and scale deployment of commercial satellite constellations lead by SpaceX Starlink, light pollution caused by satellites has had a serious impact on astronomical observations. In order to provide a friendly tool for simulating and studying the impact of mega-constellation satellites on astronomical observation, two plugin modules for the WorldWide Telescope were designed. The satellite visibility simulation module "Sats Tracker" shows whether and when satellites appear in a specific sky area. The telescope observation module "Obs Simulator" loads and simulates observation plans for telescopes. Combining the two modules, we are able to simulate and assess the influence of constellation satellites on a specific observatory at a given time. As an example application of the new tools, we simulated and analyzed the adverse effects of Starlink satellites on observation at the Xinjiang Altay Observatory, including impacts in general for the observatory site and detailed analysis for specific observation plans. In the simulation, the search for electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave events was used as an example of a research topic easily influenced by Starlink and other constellations. The software presented in this paper can be used as an auxiliary tool for observation planning to mitigate the impact of satellite constellations. It also provides an easy-to-use simulation toolkit for the public to understand Starlink and raise their awareness of Dark and Quiet Sky protection.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&C....4100652C
Inferring properties of dust in supernovae with neural networks;;Context. Determining properties of dust that formed in and around supernovae from observations remains challenging. This may be due to either incomplete coverage of data in wavelength or time, but also due to often inconspicuous signatures of dust in the observed data. 
 Aims: Here we address this challenge using modern machine learning methods to determine the amount and temperature of dust as well as its composition from a large set of simulated data. We aim to quantify if such methods are suitable to infer quantities and properties of dust from future observations of supernovae. 
 Methods: We developed a neural network consisting of eight fully connected layers and an output layer with specified activation functions that allowed us to predict the dust mass, temperature, and composition as well as their respective uncertainties for each single supernova of a large set of simulated supernova spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We produced the large set of supernova SEDs for a wide range of different supernovae and dust properties using the advanced, fully three-dimensional radiative transfer code MOCASSIN. We then convolved each SED with the entire suite of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) bandpass filters to synthesise a photometric data set. We split this data set into three subsets which were used to train, validate, and test the neural network. To find out how accurately the neural network can predict the dust mass, temperature, and composition from the simulated data, we considered three different scenarios. First, we adopted a uniform distance of ~0.43 Mpc for all simulated SEDs. Next we uniformly distributed all simulated SEDs within a volume of 0.43-65 Mpc and, finally, we artificially added random noise corresponding to a photometric uncertainty of 0.1 mag. Lastly, we conducted a feature importance analysis via SHapley Additive explanations (SHAP) to find the minimum set of JWST bandpass filters required to predict the selected dust quantities with an accuracy that is comparable to standard methods in the literature. 
 Results: We find that our neural network performs best for the scenario in which all SEDs are at the same distance and for a minimum subset of seven JWST bandpass filters within a wavelength range 3−25 µm. This results in rather small root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of ~0.08 dex and ~42 K for the most reliable predicted dust masses and temperatures, respectively. For the scenario in which SEDs are distributed out to 65 Mpc and contain synthetic noise, the most reliable predicted dust masses and temperatures achieve an RMSE of ~0.12 dex and ~38 K, respectively. Thus, in all scenarios, both predicted dust quantities have smaller predicted uncertainties compared to those in the literature achieved with common SED fitting methods of actual observations of supernovae. Moreover, our neural network can well distinguish between the different dust species included in our work, reaching a classification accuracy of up to 95% for carbon and 99% for silicate dust. 
 Conclusions: Although we trained, validated, and tested our neural network entirely on simulated SEDs, our analysis shows that a suite of JWST bandpass filters containing NIRCam F070W, F140M, F356W and F480M as well as MIRI F560W, F770W, F1000W, F1130W, F1500W, and F1800W filters are likely the most important filters needed to derive the quantities and determine the properties of dust that formed in and around supernovae from future observations. We tested this on selected optical to infrared data of SN 1987A at 615 days past explosion and find good agreement with dust masses and temperatures inferred with standard fitting methods in the literature.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...666A.176A
Asteroid spin-states of a 4 Gyr collisional family;;Context. Families of asteroids generated by the collisional fragmentation of a common parent body have been identified using clustering methods of asteroids in their proper orbital element space. However, there is growing evidence that some of the real families are larger than the corresponding cluster of objects in orbital elements, and there are families that escaped identification by clustering methods. An alternative method has been developed in order to identify collisional families from the correlation between the asteroid fragment sizes and their proper semi-major axis distance from the family centre (V-shape). This method has been shown to be effective in the cases of the very diffuse families that formed billions of years ago. 
 Aims: Here we use multiple techniques for observing asteroids to provide corroborating evidence that one of the groups of asteroids identified as a family from the correlation between size and proper semi-major axis of asteroids are real fragments of a common parent body, and thus form a collisional family. 
 Methods: We obtained photometric observations of asteroids in order to construct their rotational light curves; we combine them with the literature light curves and sparse-in-time photometry; we input these data in the light curve inversion methods, which allow us to determine a convex approximation to the 3D shape of the asteroids and their orientation in space, from which we extract the latitude (or obliquity) of the spin pole in order to assess whether an object is prograde or retrograde. We included in the analysis spin pole solutions already published in the literature aiming to increase the statistical significance of our results. The ultimate goal is to assess whether we find an excess of retrograde asteroids on the inward side of the V-shape of a 4 Gyr asteroid family identified via the V-shape method. This excess of retrograde rotators is predicted by the theory of asteroid family evolution. 
 Results: We obtained the latitude of the spin poles for 55 asteroids claimed to belong to a 4 Gyr collisional family of the inner main belt that consists of low-albedo asteroids. After re-evaluating the albedo and spectroscopic information, we found that nine of these asteroids are interlopers in the 4 Gyr family. Of the 46 remaining asteroids, 31 are found to be retrograde and 15 prograde. We also found that these retrograde rotators have a very low probability (1.29%) of being due to random sampling from an underlying uniform distribution of spin poles. 
 Conclusions: Our results constitute corroborating evidence that the asteroids identified as members of a 4 Gyr collisional family have a common origin, thus strengthening their family membership.

Trojan asteroids and the co-orbital dust ring of Venus;;Context. Co-orbital asteroids have been thought to be the possible source of the zodiacal dust ring around the orbit of Venus, but the conclusions about the orbital stability and thus about the existence of Venus Trojans are inconsistent in the literature. 
 Aims: We present a systematic survey of the orbital stability of Venus Trojans that takes the dynamical influences from General Relativity and the Yarkovsky effect into account. 
 Methods: The orbits of thousands of fictitious Venus Trojans were simulated numerically. Using a frequency analysis, we describe their orbital stabilities and the dynamical mechanisms behind them. The influences of General Relativity and of the Yarkovsky effect, which were previously either neglected or oversimplified, were investigated in long-term numerical simulations. 
 Results: The stability maps on the (a<SUB>0</SUB>, i<SUB>0</SUB>) plane and (a<SUB>0</SUB>, e<SUB>0</SUB>) plane are depicted, and the most stable Venus Trojans are found to occupy low-inclination horseshoe orbits with low eccentricities. The resonances that carve the fine structures in the stability map are determined. General Relativity decreases the stability of orbits only little, but the Yarkovsky effect may drive nearly all Venus Trojans out of the Trojan region in a relatively short time. 
 Conclusions: The Venus Trojans have a poor orbital stability and cannot survive to the age of the Solar System. The zodiacal dust ring found around the orbit of Venus is more likely a sporadic phenomenon, as the result of a temporary capture into the 1:1 mean motion resonance of dust particles that were probably produced by passing comets or asteroids, but not by Venus Trojans.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...666A..88X
SN 2019zrk, a bright SN 2009ip analog with a precursor;;We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type IIn supernova SN 2019zrk (also known as ZTF 20aacbyec). The SN shows a > 100 day precursor, with a slow rise, followed by a rapid rise to M ≈ −19.2 in the r and g bands. The post-peak light-curve decline is well fit with an exponential decay with a timescale of ∼39 days, but it shows prominent undulations, with an amplitude of ∼1 mag. Both the light curve and spectra are dominated by an interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM), probably from previous mass ejections. The spectra evolve from a scattering-dominated Type IIn spectrum to a spectrum with strong P-Cygni absorptions. The expansion velocity is high, ∼16 000 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>, even in the last spectra. The last spectrum ∼110 days after the main eruption reveals no evidence for advanced nucleosynthesis. From analysis of the spectra and light curves, we estimate the mass-loss rate to be ∼4 × 10<SUP>−2</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>−1</SUP> for a CSM velocity of 100 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>, and a CSM mass of 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We find strong similarities for both the precursor, general light curve, and spectral evolution with SN 2009ip and similar SNe, although SN 2019zrk displays a brighter peak magnitude. Different scenarios for the nature of the 09ip-class of SNe, based on pulsational pair instability eruptions, wave heating, and mergers, are discussed.

Hubble constant and nuclear equation of state from kilonova spectro-photometric light curves;;The merger of two compact objects of which at least one is a neutron star is signalled by transient electromagnetic emission in a kilonova (KN). This event is accompanied by gravitational waves and possibly other radiation messengers such as neutrinos or cosmic rays. The electromagnetic emission arises from the radioactive decay of heavy r-process elements synthesized in the material ejected during and after the merger. In this paper we show that the analysis of KNe light curves can provide cosmological distance measurements and constrain the properties of the ejecta. In this respect, MAAT, the new Integral Field Unit in the OSIRIS spectrograph on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC), is well suited for the study of KNe by performing absolute spectro-photometry over the entire 3600 − 10 000 Å spectral range. Here, we study the most representative cases regarding the scientific interest of KNe from binary neutron stars, and we evaluate the observational prospects and performance of MAAT on the GTC to do the following: (a) study the impact of the equation of state on the KN light curve, and determine to what extent bounds on neutron star (NS) radii or compactness deriving from KN peak magnitudes can be identified and (b) measure the Hubble constant, H<SUB>0</SUB>, with precision improved by up to 40%, when both gravitational wave data and photometric-light curves are used. In this context we discuss how the equation of state, the viewing angle, and the distance affect the precision and estimated value of H<SUB>0</SUB>.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...666A..67P
The Hubble constant from two sibling Type Ia supernovae in the nearby galaxy NGC 4414: SN 1974G and SN 2021J;;Having two "sibling" Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the same galaxy offers additional advantages in reducing a variety of systematic errors involved in estimating the Hubble constant, H<SUB>0</SUB>. NGC 4414 is a nearby galaxy included in the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project to measure its distance using Cepheid variables. It hosts two sibling SNe Ia: SN 2021J and SN 1974G. This provides the opportunity to improve the precision of the previous estimate of H<SUB>0</SUB>, which was based solely on SN 1974G. Here we present new optical BVRI photometry obtained at the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada and complement it with Swift UVOT UBV data, which cover the first 70 days of emission of SN 2021J. A first look at SN 2021J optical spectra obtained with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) reveals typical SN type Ia features. The main SN luminosity parameters for the two sibling SNe are obtained by using SNooPy, a light curve fitting code based on templates. Using a hierarchical bayesian approach, we build the Hubble diagram with a sample of 96 SNe Ia obtained from the Combined Pantheon Sample in the redshift range z = 0.02 − 0.075, and calibrate the zero point with the two sibling type-Ia SNe in NGC 4414. We report a value of the Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB> = 72.19 ± 2.32 (stat.) ±3.42 (syst.) km s<SUP>−1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>−1</SUP>. We expect a reduction of the systematic error after a new analysis of the Cepheids period-luminosity relation using the upcoming Gaia DR4 and additional Cepheids from the HST and JWST.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...666A..13G
An elliptical accretion disk following the tidal disruption event AT 2020zso;;
 Aims: The modelling of spectroscopic observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) to date suggests that the newly formed accretion disks are mostly quasi-circular. In this work we study the transient event AT 2020zso, hosted by an active galactic nucleus (AGN; as inferred from narrow emission line diagnostics), with the aim of characterising the properties of its newly formed accretion flow. 
 Methods: We classify AT 2020zso as a TDE based on the blackbody evolution inferred from UV/optical photometric observations and spectral line content and evolution. We identify transient, double-peaked Bowen (N III), He I, He II, and Hα emission lines. We model medium-resolution optical spectroscopy of the He II (after careful de-blending of the N III contribution) and Hα lines during the rise, peak, and early decline of the light curve using relativistic, elliptical accretion disk models. 
 Results: We find that the spectral evolution before the peak can be explained by optical depth effects consistent with an outflowing, optically thick Eddington envelope. Around the peak, the envelope reaches its maximum extent (approximately 10<SUP>15</SUP> cm, or ∼3000-6000 gravitational radii for an inferred black hole mass of 5−10 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) and becomes optically thin. The Hα and He II emission lines at and after the peak can be reproduced with a highly inclined (i = 85 ± 5 degrees), highly elliptical (e = 0.97 ± 0.01), and relatively compact (R<SUB>in</SUB> = several 100 R<SUB>g</SUB> and R<SUB>out</SUB> = several 1000 R<SUB>g</SUB>) accretion disk. 
 Conclusions: Overall, the line profiles suggest a highly elliptical geometry for the new accretion flow, consistent with theoretical expectations of newly formed TDE disks. We quantitatively confirm, for the first time, the high inclination nature of a Bowen (and X-ray dim) TDE, consistent with the unification picture of TDEs, where the inclination largely determines the observational appearance. Rapid line profile variations rule out the binary supermassive black hole hypothesis as the origin of the eccentricity; these results thus provide a direct link between a TDE in an AGN and the eccentric accretion disk. We illustrate for the first time how optical spectroscopy can be used to constrain the black hole spin, through (the lack of) disk precession signatures (changes in inferred inclination). We constrain the disk alignment timescale to > 15 days in AT2020zso, which rules out high black hole spin values (a < 0.8) for M<SUB>BH</SUB> ∼ 10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and disk viscosity α ≳ 0.1.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...666A...6W
Validation and atmospheric exploration of the sub-Neptune TOI-2136b around a nearby M3 dwarf;;Context. The NASA space telescope TESS is currently in the extended mission of its all-sky search for new transiting planets. Of the thousands of candidates that TESS is expected to deliver, transiting planets orbiting nearby M dwarfs are particularly interesting targets since they provide a great opportunity to characterize their atmospheres by transmission spectroscopy. 
 Aims: We aim to validate and characterize the new sub-Neptune-sized planet candidate TOI-2136.01 orbiting a nearby M dwarf (d = 33.36 ± 0.02pc, T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3373 ± 108 K) with an orbital period of 7.852 days. 
 Methods: We use TESS data, ground-based multicolor photometry, and radial velocity measurements with the InfraRed Doppler (IRD) instrument on the Subaru Telescope to validate the planetary nature of TOI-2136.01, and estimate the stellar and planetary parameters. We also conduct high-resolution transmission spectroscopy to search for helium in its atmosphere. 
 Results: We confirm that TOI-2136.01 (now named TOI-2136b) is a bona fide planet with a planetary radius of R<SUB>p</SUB> = 2.20 ± 0.07R<SUB>⊕</SUB> and a mass of M<SUB>p</SUB> = 4.7<SUB>−2.6</SUB><SUP>+3.1</SUP> M<SUB>⊕</SUB>. We also search for helium 10830 Å absorption lines and place an upper limit on the equivalent width of <7.8 mÅ and on the absorption signal of <1.44% with 95% confidence. 
 Conclusions: TOI-2136b is a sub-Neptune transiting a nearby and bright star (J = 10.8 mag), and is a potentially hycean planet, which is a new class of habitable planets with large oceans under a H<SUB>2</SUB>-rich atmosphere, making it an excellent target for atmospheric studies to understand the formation, evolution, and habitability of the small planets.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...666A...4K
Gap Transients Interacting with Circumstellar Medium;;In the last 20 years, modern wide-field surveys discovered a new class of peculiar transients, which lie in the luminosity gap between standard supernovae and classical novae. These transients are often called "intermediate luminosity optical transients" or "gap transients". They are usually distinguished in subgroups based on their phenomenology, such as supernova impostors, intermediate luminosity red transients, and luminous red novae. In this review, we present a brief overview of their observational features and possible physical scenarios to date, in the attempt to understand their nature.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Univ....8..493C
Velocity and azimuthal anisotropy structures beneath the Dianzhong Block and its vicinity, SE Tibetan Plateau, revealed by eikonal equation-based traveltime tomography;;The Dianzhong Block (DZB) located on the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau is an important tectonic zone characterized by the intense flow of crustal material. Although it is widely accepted that materials originating from the Tibetan Plateau migrate southeastward in the DZB and its vicinity, the flow mechanism and subsurface structures remain controversial. Here, we image the subsurface velocity and azimuthal anisotropy structures beneath the DZB and its surroundings by using eikonal equation-based tomography to study the crustal flow and deformation mechanisms. In this study, we collect high-quality seismic data from 290 broadband seismic stations and manually pick a total of 31,981 first arrivals. Our tomographic results display prominent velocity anomalies and complex azimuthal anisotropy patterns. In the upper crust, our results reveal predominant high-velocity anomalies, which are related to the Emeishan large igneous province (ELIP) and the stable Simao Block. We find strong low-velocity anomalies beneath the DZB in the middle-lower crust. The low-velocity anomalies extend southward from the Xiaojinhe Fault (XJHF) to the Red River Fault (RRF) and then rotate southeastward to the east of the Xiaojiang Fault (XJF). In addition, the inverted fast velocity directions generally follow the strike of the low-velocity anomalies. Based on these findings, we consider the existence of middle-lower crustal flow inside the DZB. Three distinct features of azimuthal anisotropy in the middle-upper crust are found around the XJF reflecting complex deformation, which may indicate different factors controlling the deformation of the XJF from the north to the south. In the lower crust and uppermost mantle, the azimuthal anisotropy beneath the RRF is relatively complex, exhibiting two patterns: one perpendicular and another parallel to the fault.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Tectp.83929525L
A Photometric Study of Two Contact Binaries: CRTS J025408.1+265957 and CRTS J012111.1+272933;;We performed new photometric observations for two contact binaries (i.e., CRTS J025408.1+265957 and CRTS J012111.1+272933), which were observed by the 1.0 m telescope at Xingjiang Astronomical Observatory. From our light curves and several survey data, we derived several sets of photometric solutions. We found that CRTS J025408.1+265957 and CRTS J012111.1+272933 were A- and W-type W UMa, respectively. The results imply that the spot migrates or disappears in the two contact binaries, which were identified by chromospheric activity emissions (e.g., H<SUB> α </SUB> emission) from LAMOST spectra. From the O-C curves, the orbital periods of the two contact binaries may be increasing, which is interpreted by the mass transfer from the less massive component to the more massive one. With mass transferring, the two contact binaries may evolve from the contact configurations to semi-detached ones as predicted by the theory of thermal relaxation oscillation.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022RAA....22i5017M
Observing GW190521-like binary black holes and their environment with LISA;;Binaries of relatively massive black holes like GW190521 have been proposed to form in dense gas environments, such as the disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and they might be associated with transient electromagnetic counterparts. The interactions of this putative environment with the binary could leave a significant imprint at the low gravitational wave frequencies observable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We show that LISA will be able to detect up to ten GW190521-like black hole binaries, with sky position errors ≲1 deg<SUP>2</SUP>. Moreover, it will measure directly various effects due to the orbital motion around the supermassive black hole at the center of the AGN, especially the Doppler modulation and the Shapiro time delay. Thanks to a careful treatment of their frequency domain signal, we were able to perform the full parameter estimation of Doppler and Shapiro-modulated binaries as seen by LISA. We find that the Doppler and Shapiro effects will allow for measuring the AGN parameters (radius and inclination of the orbit around the AGN, central black hole mass) with up to percent-level precision. Properly modeling these low-frequency environmental effects is crucial to determine the binary formation history, as well as to avoid biases in the reconstruction of the source parameters and in tests of general relativity with gravitational waves.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PhRvD.106f4056S
Determining the Hubble constant without the sound horizon: A 3.6 % constraint on H<SUB>0</SUB> from galaxy surveys, CMB lensing, and supernovae;;Many theoretical resolutions to the so-called "Hubble tension" rely on modifying the sound horizon at recombination, r<SUB>s</SUB>, and thus the acoustic scale used as a standard ruler in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large scale structure (LSS) datasets. As shown in a number of recent works, these observables can also be used to compute r<SUB>s</SUB>-independent constraints on H<SUB>0</SUB> by making use of the horizon scale at matter-radiation equality, k<SUB>eq</SUB>, which has different sensitivity to high redshift physics than r<SUB>s</SUB>. As such, r<SUB>s</SUB>- and k<SUB>eq</SUB>-based measurements of H<SUB>0</SUB> (within a Λ CDM framework) may differ if there is new physics present pre-recombination. In this work, we present the tightest constraints on the latter from current data, finding H<SUB>0</SUB>=64.8<SUB>-2.5</SUB><SUP>+2.2</SUP> km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> at 68% CL from a combination of BOSS galaxy power spectra, Planck CMB lensing, and the newly released PANTHEON+ supernova constraints, as well as physical priors on the baryon density, neutrino mass, and spectral index. The BOSS and Planck measurements have different degeneracy directions, leading to the improved combined constraints, with a bound of H<SUB>0</SUB>=67.1<SUB>-2.9</SUB><SUP>+2.5</SUP> (63.6<SUB>-3.6</SUB><SUP>+2.9</SUP>) from BOSS (Planck) alone in km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> units. The results show some dependence on the neutrino mass bounds, with the constraint broadening to H<SUB>0</SUB>=68.0<SUB>-3.2</SUB><SUP>+2.9</SUP> km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> if we instead impose a weak prior on ∑m<SUB>ν</SUB> from terrestrial experiments rather than assuming ∑m<SUB>ν</SUB><0.26 eV , or shifting to H<SUB>0</SUB>=64.6 ±2.4 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP> if the neutrino mass is fixed to its minimal value. Even without dependence on the sound horizon, our results are in ≈3 σ tension with those obtained from the Cepheid-calibrated distance ladder, which begins to cause problems for new physics models that vary H<SUB>0</SUB> by changing acoustic physics or the expansion history immediately prior to recombination.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PhRvD.106f3530P
Identifying Transient Candidates in the Dark Energy Survey Using Convolutional Neural Networks;;The ability to discover new transient candidates via image differencing without direct human intervention is an important task in observational astronomy. For these kind of image classification problems, machine learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable success. In this work, we present the results of an automated transient candidate identification on images with CNNs for an extant data set from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova program, whose main focus was on using Type Ia supernovae for cosmology. By performing an architecture search of CNNs, we identify networks that efficiently select non-artifacts (e.g., supernovae, variable stars, AGN, etc.) from artifacts (image defects, mis-subtractions, etc.), achieving the efficiency of previous work performed with random Forests, without the need to expend any effort in feature identification. The CNNs also help us identify a subset of mislabeled images. Performing a relabeling of the images in this subset, the resulting classification with CNNs is significantly better than previous results, lowering the false positive rate by 27% at a fixed missed detection rate of 0.05.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134i4501A
Optical Time-series Photometry of the Symbiotic Nova V1835 Aquilae;;We present time-series CCD photometry in the BVRI passbands of the recently identified symbiotic nova V1835 Aquilae (NSV 11749) over an interval of 5.1 yr with 7-14 day cadence, observed during its quiescence. We find slow light variations with a range of ~0.9 mag in V and ~0.3 mag in I. Analysis of these data show strong periodicity at 419 ± 10 days, which we interpret to be the system's orbital period. A dip in the otherwise-sinusoidal phased light curve suggests a weak ellipsoidal effect due to tidal distortion of the giant star, which in turn opens the possibility that V1835 Aql transfers some of its mass to the hot component via Roche lobe overflow rather than via a stellar wind. We also find evidence that V1835 Aql is an S-type symbiotic star, relatively free of circumstellar dust, and include it among the nuclear burning group of symbiotics. Finally, we provide photometry, periods, and light curve classifications for 22 variable stars in the field around V1835 Aql, about half of which are newly identified.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134i4201C
A dynamically discovered and characterized non-accreting neutron star-M dwarf binary candidate;;Typically, neutron stars are discovered by observations at radio, X-ray or gamma-ray wavelengths. Unlike radio pulsar surveys and X-ray observations, optical time-domain surveys can unveil and characterize exciting but less explored non-accreting and/or non-beaming neutron stars in binaries. Here we report the discovery of such a neutron star candidate using the LAMOST spectroscopic survey. The candidate, designated LAMOST J112306.9 + 400736, is in a single-lined spectroscopic binary containing an optically visible M star. The star's large radial velocity variation and ellipsoidal variations indicate a relatively massive unseen companion. Utilizing follow-up spectroscopy from the Palomar 200 in. telescope and high-precision photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we measure a companion mass of 1.2 4<SUB>−0.03</SUB><SUP>+0.03</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB> . Main-sequence stars with this mass are ruled out, leaving a neutron star or a massive white dwarf. Although a massive white dwarf cannot be excluded, the lack of UV excess radiation from the companion supports the neutron star hypothesis. Deep radio observations with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) yielded no detections of either pulsed or persistent emission. J112306.9 + 400736 is not detected in numerous X-ray and gamma-ray surveys, suggesting that the neutron star candidate is not currently accreting and pulsing. Our work exemplifies the capability of discovering compact objects in non-accreting close binaries by synergizing optical time-domain spectroscopy and high-cadence photometry.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022NatAs...6.1203Y
A Roche lobe-filling hot subdwarf and white dwarf binary: possible detection of an ejected common envelope;;Binaries consisting of a hot subdwarf star and an accreting white dwarf (WD) are sources of gravitational wave radiation at low frequencies and possible progenitors of Type Ia supernovae if the WD mass is large enough. Here, we report the discovery of the third binary known of this kind: It consists of a hot subdwarf O (sdO) star and a WD with an orbital period of 3.495 h and an orbital shrinkage of 0.1 s in 6 yr. The sdO star overfills its Roche lobe and likely transfers mass to the WD via an accretion disc. From spectroscopy, we obtain an effective temperature of $T_{\mathrm{eff}}=54\, 240\pm 1840$ K and a surface gravity of log g = 4.841 ± 0.108 for the sdO star. From the light curve analysis, we obtain an sdO mass of M<SUB>sdO</SUB> = 0.55 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a mass ratio of q = M<SUB>WD</SUB>/M<SUB>sdO</SUB> = 0.738 ± 0.001. Also, we estimate that the disc has a radius of $\sim\!0.41\ \mathrm{R}_\odot$ and a thickness of $\sim\!0.18\ \mathrm{R}_\odot$. The origin of this binary is probably a common envelope ejection channel, where the progenitor of the sdO star is either a red giant branch star or, more likely, an early asymptotic giant branch star; the sdO star will subsequently evolve into a WD and merge with its WD companion, likely resulting in an R Coronae Borealis (R CrB) star. The outstanding feature in the spectrum of this object is strong Ca H&K lines, which are blueshifted by ~200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and likely originate from the recently ejected common envelope, and we estimated that the remnant common envelope (CE) material in the binary system has a density $\sim\!6\times 10^{-10}\ {\rm g\, cm}^{-3}$.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.3370L
Discovery and analysis of three magnetic hot subdwarf stars: evidence for merger-induced magnetic fields;;Magnetic fields can play an important role in stellar evolution. Among white dwarfs, the most common stellar remnant, the fraction of magnetic systems is more than 20 per cent. The origin of magnetic fields in white dwarfs, which show strengths ranging from 40 kG to hundreds of MG, is still a topic of debate. In contrast, only one magnetic hot subdwarf star has been identified out of thousands of known systems. Hot subdwarfs are formed from binary interaction, a process often associated with the generation of magnetic fields, and will evolve to become white dwarfs, which makes the lack of detected magnetic hot subdwarfs a puzzling phenomenon. Here we report the discovery of three new magnetic hot subdwarfs with field strengths in the range 300-500 kG. Like the only previously known system, they are all helium-rich O-type stars (He-sdOs). We analysed multiple archival spectra of the three systems and derived their stellar properties. We find that they all lack radial velocity variability, suggesting formation via a merger channel. However, we derive higher than typical hydrogen abundances for their spectral type, which are in disagreement with current model predictions. Our findings suggest a lower limit to the magnetic fraction of hot subdwarfs of $0.147^{+0.143}_{-0.047}$ per cent, and provide evidence for merger-induced magnetic fields which could explain white dwarfs with field strengths of 50-150 MG, assuming magnetic flux conservation.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.2496P
Photometric and spectroscopic study of the burst-like brightening of two Gaia-alerted young stellar objects;;Young stars show variability on different time-scales from hours to decades, with a range of amplitudes. We studied two young stars, which triggered the Gaia Science Alerts system due to brightenings on a time-scale of a year. Gaia20bwa brightened by about half a magnitude, whereas Gaia20fgx brightened by about two and half magnitudes. We analysed the Gaia light curves, additional photometry, and spectra taken with the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and the Gran Telescopio Canarias. Several emission lines were detected towards Gaia20bwa, including hydrogen lines from H α to H δ, Pa β, Br γ, and lines of Ca II, O I, and Na I. The H α and Br γ lines were detected towards Gaia20fgx in emission in its bright state, with additional CO lines in absorption, and the Pa β line with an inverse P Cygni profile during its fading. Based on the Br γ lines, the accretion rate was $(2.4\!-\!3.1)\times 10^{-8}\, {\rm M}_\odot$ yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for Gaia20bwa and $(4.5\!-\!6.6)\times 10^{-8}\, {\rm M}_\odot$ yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for Gaia20fgx during their bright state. The accretion rate of Gaia20fgx dropped by almost a factor of 10 on a time-scale of half a year. The accretion parameters of both stars were found to be similar to those of classical T Tauri stars, lower than those of young eruptive stars. However, the amplitude and time-scale of these brightenings place these stars to a region of the parameter space, which is rarely populated by young stars. This suggests a new class of young stars, which produce outbursts on a time-scale similar to young eruptive stars, but with smaller amplitudes.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.1774N
Radio emission from simulated tidal disruption events;;Several tidal disruption events such as ASASSN-14li and XMMSL1 J0740-85 have recently been observed in the radio. While the radio emission of some tidal disruption events are attributed to a relativistic jet, a few others are associated with a non-relativistic outflow. This outflow can either be due to a spherical wind or unbound tidal debris. We explore this latter hypothesis in this paper. We show that the maximum velocity of the unbound debris is a function of the impact parameter, such that smaller impact parameters (closer approaches) produce larger maximum velocities. We then model this outflow which expands and shocks the local interstellar medium and compute the peak radio flux and frequency as functions of the impact parameter. Moreover, multiple epochs of observations can put additional constraints on the profile of the local interstellar medium. We apply this analysis to four tidal disruption events whose radio emission is attributed to a non-relativistic outflow and show that the velocities of the unbound material are consistent with our simulated events. We also place constraints on the density profile of three of the four tidal disruption events with multiple epochs of observations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.1699S
Discovering vanishing objects in POSS I red images using the Virtual Observatory;;In this paper, we report a search for vanishing sources in POSS I red images using virtual observatory (VO) archives, tools, and services. The search, conducted in the framework of the VASCO project, aims at finding POSS I (red) sources not present in recent catalogues like Pan-STARRS DR2 (limiting magnitude r = 21.4) or Gaia EDR3 (limiting magnitude G = 21). We found 298 165 sources visible only in POSS I plates, out of which 288 770 had a cross-match within 5 arcsec in other archives (mainly in the infrared), 189 were classified as asteroids, 35 as variable objects, 3592 as artefacts from the comparison to a second digitization (Supercosmos), and 180 as high proper motion objects without information on proper motion in Gaia EDR3. The remaining unidentified transients (5399) as well as the 172 163 sources not detected in the optical but identified in the infrared regime are available from a VO compliant archive and can be of interest in searches for strong M-dwarf flares, high-redshift supernovae, asteroids, or other categories of unidentified red transients. No point sources were detected by both POSS-I and POSS-II before vanishing, setting the rate of failed supernovae in the Milky Way during 70 yr to less than one in one billion.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.1380S
A gap in the double white dwarf separation distribution caused by the common-envelope evolution: astrometric evidence from Gaia;;The trajectory of the center of light of an unresolved binary is different from that of its center of mass. Binary-induced stellar centroid wobbling can therefore be detected as an excess in the goodness-of-fit of the single-star astrometric model. We use reduced χ<SUP>2</SUP> of the astrometric fit in the Gaia Early Data Release 3 to detect the likely unresolved double white dwarfs (DWDs). Using parallax-based distances we convert the excess of reduced χ<SUP>2</SUP> into the amplitude of the centroid wobble δa, which is proportional to the binary separation a. The measured δa distribution drops towards larger wobble amplitudes and shows a break around log<SUB>10</SUB>δa ≈ -0.7 where it steepens. The integral of the distribution yields DWD fraction of 6.5 ± 3.7 per cent in the range $0.01  a\, (\text{au})  2$. Using synthetic models of the Galactic DWDs we demonstrate that the break in the δa distribution corresponds to one side of a deep gap in the DWD separation distribution at around a ≈ 1 au. Model DWDs with separations less than several au shrink dramatically due to (at least one) common envelope phase, reshaping the original separation distribution, clearing a gap and creating a pile-up of systems with a ≈ 0.01 au and log<SUB>10</SUB>δa < -2. Our models reproduce the overall shape of the observed δa distribution and its normalization, however the predicted drop in the numbers of DWDs beyond the break is steeper than in the data.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.1228K
The bulge masses of TDE host galaxies and their scaling with black hole mass;;Tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide a means to probe the low end of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass distribution, as they are only observable below the Hills mass (≲ 10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). Here, we attempt to calibrate the scaling of SMBH mass with host galaxy bulge mass, enabling SMBH masses to be estimated for large TDE samples without the need for follow-up observations or extrapolations of relations based on high-mass samples. We derive host galaxy masses using PROSPECTOR fits to the UV-MIR spectral energy distributions for the hosts of 29 well-observed TDEs with BH mass estimates from MOSFIT. We then conduct detailed bulge/disc decomposition using SDSS and PanSTARRS imaging, and provide a catalogue of bulge masses. We measure a positive correlation between SMBH and bulge mass for the TDE sample, with a power-law slope of 0.28 and significance p = 0.06 (Spearmans) and p = 0.05 (Pearsons), and an intrinsic scatter of 0.2 dex. Applying MC resampling and bootstrapping, we find a more conservative estimate of the slope is 0.18 ± 0.11, dominated by the systematic errors from PROSPECTOR and MOSFIT. This is shallower than the slope at high SMBH mass, which may be due to a bias in the TDE sample towards lower mass BHs that can more easily disrupt low-mass stars outside of the event horizon. When combining the TDE sample with that of the high-mass regime, we find that TDEs are successful in extending the SMBH - stellar mass relationship further down the mass spectrum and provide a relationship across the full range of SMBH masses.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515.1146R
Robust features of off-axis gamma-ray burst afterglow light curves;;The ultra-relativistic outflows powering gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) acquire angular structure through their interaction with external material. They are often characterized by a compact, nearly uniform narrow core (with half-opening angle θ<SUB>c,{ϵ, Γ}</SUB>) surrounded by material with energy per unit solid angle ($\epsilon =\epsilon _{\rm c}\Theta _{\epsilon }^{-a}$, where $\Theta _{\lbrace \epsilon ,\Gamma \rbrace }=[1+\theta ^2/\theta _{{\rm c},\lbrace \epsilon ,\Gamma \rbrace }^2]^{1/2}$) and initial specific kinetic energy ($\Gamma _0-1=[\Gamma _{\rm c}-1]\Theta _\Gamma ^{-b}$) declining as power laws. Multiwavelength afterglow light curves of off-axis jets (with viewing angle θ<SUB>obs</SUB> > θ<SUB>c</SUB>) offer robust ways to constrain a, b, and the external density radial profile (ρ ∝ R<SUP>-k</SUP>), even while other burst parameters may remain highly degenerate. We extend our previous work on such afterglows to include more realistic angular structure profiles derived from three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of both long and short GRBs (addressing also jets with shallow angular energy profiles, whose emission exhibits unique evolution). We present afterglow light curves based on our parametrized power-law jet angular profiles for different viewing angles θ<SUB>obs</SUB> and k = {0, 1, 2}. We identify a unique evolutionary power-law phase of the characteristic synchrotron frequencies (ν<SUB>m</SUB> and ν<SUB>c</SUB>) that manifests when the light curve is dominated by emission sensitive to the angular structure of the outflow. We calculate the criterion for obtaining single or double peaked light curves in the general case when θ<SUB>c,Γ</SUB> ≠ θ<SUB>c,ϵ</SUB>. We emphasize how the shape of the light curve and the temporal evolution of ν<SUB>m</SUB> and ν<SUB>c</SUB> can be used to constrain the outflow structure and potentially distinguish between magnetic and hydrodynamic jets.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515..555B
Confronting double-detonation sub-Chandrasekhar models with the low-luminosity suppression of Type Ia supernovae;;Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are likely the thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen (CO) white-dwarf (WD) stars, but their progenitor systems remain elusive. Recently, Sharon & Kushnir used The Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey to construct a synthesized <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass, M<SUB>Ni56</SUB>, distribution of SNe Ia. They found that the rate of low-luminosity ($M_\text{Ni56}\approx 0.15\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) SNe Ia is lower by a factor of ~10 than the more common $M_\text{Ni56}\approx 0.7\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$ events. We here show that in order for the double-detonation model (DDM, in which a propagating thermonuclear detonation wave, TNDW, within a thin helium shell surrounding a sub-Chandrasekhar mass CO core triggers a TNDW within the core) to explain this low-luminosity suppression, the probability of a low-mass ($\approx 0.85\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) WD explosion should be ~100-fold lower than that of a high-mass ($\approx 1.05\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$) WD. One possible explanation is that the ignition of low-mass CO cores is somehow suppressed. We use accurate one-dimensional numerical simulations to show that if a TNDW is able to propagate within the helium shell, then the ignition within the CO core is guaranteed (resolved here for the first time in a full-star simulation), even for $0.7\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$ WDs, providing no natural explanation for the low-luminosity suppression. DDM could explain the low-luminosity suppression if the mass distribution of primary WDs in close binaries is dramatically different from the field distribution; if the Helium shell ignition probability is suppressed for low-mass WDs; or if multidimensional perturbations significantly change our results.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515..286G
Spectropolarimetry of the tidal disruption event AT 2019qiz: a quasi-spherical reprocessing layer;;We present optical spectropolarimetry of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT 2019qiz on days +0 and +29 relative to maximum brightness. Continuum polarization, which informs the shape of the electron-scattering surface, was found to be consistent with 0 per cent at peak brightness. On day +29, the continuum polarization rose to ~1 per cent, making this the first reported spectropolarimetric evolution of a TDE. These findings are incompatible with a naked eccentric disc that lacks significant mass outflow. Instead, the spectropolarimetry paints a picture wherein, at maximum brightness, high-frequency emission from the accretion disc is reprocessed into the optical band by a nearly spherical, optically thick, electron-scattering photosphere located far away from the black hole. We estimate the radius of the scattering photosphere to be $\sim 100\rm \, au$ at maximum brightness - significantly larger than the tidal radius ($\sim 1\rm \, au$) and the thermalization radius ($\sim 30\rm \, au$) where the optical continuum is formed. A month later, as the fallback rate drops and the scattering photosphere recedes, the continuum polarization increases, revealing a moderately aspherical interior. We also see evidence for smaller scale density variations in the scattering photosphere, inferred from the scatter of the data in the Stokes q-u plane. On day +29, the H α emission-line peak is depolarized to ~0.3 per cent (compared to ~1 per cent continuum polarization), and displays a gradual rise towards the line's redder wavelengths. This observation indicates the H α line formed near the electron-scattering radius.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515..138P
Multiple giant eruptions and X-ray emission in the recoiling AGN/LBV candidate SDSS1133;;We present a comprehensive analysis of 20 yr worth of multicolour photometric light curves, multiepoch optical spectra, and X-ray data of an off-nuclear variable object SDSS1133 in Mrk 177 at z = 0.0079. The UV-optical light curves reveal that SDSS1133 experienced four outbursts in 2001, 2014, 2019, and 2021. The persistent UV-optical luminosity in the non-outbursting state is ~10<SUP>41</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> with small-scale flux variations, and peak luminosities during the outbursts reach ~10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The optical spectra exhibit enduring broad hydrogen Balmer P-Cygni profiles with the absorption minimum at ~-2000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, indicating the presence of fast-moving ejecta. Chandra detected weak X-ray emission at a 0.3-10-keV luminosity of L<SUB>X</SUB> = 4 × 10<SUP>38</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> after the 2019 outburst. These lines of evidence suggests that SDSS1133 is an extreme luminous blue variable (LBV) star experiencing multiple giant eruptions with interactions of the ejected shell with different shells and/or circumstellar medium (CSM), and disfavours the recoiling active galactic nuclei scenario suggested in the literature. We suggest that pulsational pair-instability may provide a viable explanation for the multiple energetic eruptions in SDSS1133. If the current activity of SDSS1133 is a precursor of a supernova explosion, we may be able to observe a few additional giant eruptions and then the terminal supernova explosion or collapse to a massive black hole in future observations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.515..110K
SRGe J214919.3+673634—a Candidate for AM Her Variables Discovered by the eROSITA Telescope onboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma Orbital Observatory;;We present the results of the optical identification, classification, and analysis of our photometric and spectroscopic observations of the X-ray transient SRGe J214919.3+673634 discovered by the eROSITA telescope onboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma orbital observatory in the summer of 2021 during the fourth sky survey. The photometric observations of the optical counterpart of SRGe J214919.3+673634 performed at the 6-m BTA telescope of SAO RAS, the 1.5-m Russian-Turkish telescope RTT-150, and the 2.5-m telescope of CMO SAI MSU as well the archival data from the 48-inch ZTF telescope have shown that the source is a cataclysmic variable with an orbital period $P=85± 0.4$ min and exhibits a long-term photometric variability from $23.5<SUP>m</SUP>$ (low state) to $20<SUP>m</SUP>$ (high state). We show that the light curves in the high state are consistent with the model of an accreting magnetized white dwarf and suggest that SRGe J214919.3+673634 belongs to the AM Her variables. The spectra of the optical counterpart taken in the low state at BTA are consistent with the spectral energy distribution of a white dwarf with a temperature ${∼}24 000$ K.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AstL...48..530B
Monitoring AGNs with Hβ Asymmetry. III. Long-term Reverberation Mapping Results of 15 Palomar-Green Quasars;;In this third paper of the series reporting on the reverberation mapping campaign of active galactic nuclei with asymmetric Hβ emission-line profiles, we present results for 15 Palomar-Green quasars using spectra obtained between the end of 2016-2021 May. This campaign combines long time spans with relatively high cadence. For eight objects, both the time lags obtained from the entire light curves and the measurements from individual observing seasons are provided. Reverberation mapping of nine of our targets has been attempted for the first time, while the results for six others can be compared with previous campaigns. We measure the Hβ time lags over periods of years and estimate their black hole masses. The long duration of the campaign enables us to investigate their broad-line region (BLR) geometry and kinematics for different years by using velocity-resolved lags, which demonstrate signatures of diverse BLR geometry and kinematics. The BLR geometry and kinematics of individual objects are discussed. In this sample, the BLR kinematics of Keplerian/virialized motion and inflow is more common than that of outflow.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..262...14B
A Bayesian Analysis of Physical Parameters for 783 Kepler Close Binaries: Extreme-mass-ratio Systems and a New Mass Ratio versus Period Lower Limit;;Contact binary star systems represent the long-lived penultimate phase of binary evolution. Population statistics of their physical parameters inform an understanding of binary evolutionary pathways and end products. We use light curves and new optical spectroscopy to conduct a pilot study of ten (near) contact systems in the long-period (P > 0.5 days) tail of close binaries in the Kepler field. We use PHOEBE light-curve models to compute Bayesian probabilities on five principal system parameters. Mass ratios and third-light contributions measured from spectra agree well with those inferred from the light curves. Pilot study systems have extreme mass ratios q < 0.32. Most are triples. Analysis of the unbiased sample of 783 0.15 d < P < 2 days (near) contact binaries results in 178 probable contact systems, 114 probable detached systems, and 491 ambiguous systems for which we report best-fitting and 16th-/50th-/84th-percentile parameters. Contact systems are rare at periods P > 0.5 days, as are systems with q > 0.8. There exists an empirical mass ratio lower limit ${q}_{\min }(P)$ ≈ 0.05-0.15 below which contact systems are absent, supporting a new set of theoretical predictions obtained by modeling the evolution of contact systems under the constraints of mass and angular momentum conservation. Premerger systems should lie at long periods and near this mass ratio lower limit, which rises from q = 0.044 for P = 0.74 days to q = 0.15 at P = 2.0 days. These findings support a scenario whereby nuclear evolution of the primary (more massive) star drives mass transfer to the primary, thus moving systems toward extreme q and larger P until the onset of the Darwin instability at ${q}_{\min }$ precipitates a merger.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..262...12K
Cooling Envelope Model for Tidal Disruption Events;;We present a toy model for the thermal optical/UV/X-ray emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs). Motivated by recent hydrodynamical simulations, we assume that the debris streams promptly and rapidly circularize (on the orbital period of the most tightly bound debris), generating a hot quasi-spherical pressure-supported envelope of radius R <SUB>v</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>14</SUP> cm (photosphere radius ~10<SUP>15</SUP> cm) surrounding the supermassive black hole (SMBH). As the envelope cools radiatively, it undergoes Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction R <SUB>v</SUB> ∝ t <SUP>-1</SUP>, its temperature rising T <SUB>eff</SUB> ∝ t <SUP>1/2</SUP> while its total luminosity remains roughly constant; the optical luminosity decays as $\nu {L}_{\nu }\propto \,{R}_{v}^{2}{T}_{\mathrm{eff}}\propto {t}^{-3/2}$ . Despite this similarity to the mass fallback rate ${\dot{M}}_{\mathrm{fb}}\propto {t}^{-5/3}$ , envelope heating from fallback accretion is subdominant compared to the envelope cooling luminosity except near optical peak (where they are comparable). Envelope contraction can be delayed by energy injection from accretion from the inner envelope onto the SMBH in a regulated manner, leading to a late-time flattening of the optical/X-ray light curves, similar to those observed in some TDEs. Eventually, as the envelope contracts to near the circularization radius, the SMBH accretion rate rises to its maximum, in tandem with the decreasing optical luminosity. This cooling-induced (rather than circularization-induced) delay of up to several hundred days may account for the delayed onset of thermal X-rays, late-time radio flares, and high-energy neutrino generation, observed in some TDEs. We compare the model predictions to recent TDE light-curve correlation studies, finding both agreement and points of tension.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...937L..12M
Migratory Outbursting Quasi-Hilda Object 282P/(323137) 2003 BM80;;We report that object 282P/(323137) 2003 BM<SUB>80</SUB> is undergoing a sustained activity outburst, lasting over 15 months thus far. These findings stem in part from our NASA Partner Citizen Science project Active Asteroids (http://activeasteroids.net), which we introduce here. We acquired new observations of 282P via our observing campaign (Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT), Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT), and the Gemini South telescope), confirming 282P was active on UT 2022 June 7, some 15 months after 2021 March images showed activity in the 2021-2022 epoch. We classify 282P as a member of the quasi-Hilda objects (QHOs), a group of dynamically unstable objects found in an orbital region similar to, but distinct in their dynamical characteristics to, the Hilda asteroids (objects in 3:2 resonance with Jupiter). Our dynamical simulations show 282P has undergone at least five close encounters with Jupiter and one with Saturn over the last 180 yr. 282P was most likely a Centaur or Jupiter-family comet (JFC) 250 yr ago. In 350 yr, following some 15 strong Jovian interactions, 282P will most likely migrate to become a JFC or, less likely, an outer main-belt asteroid orbit. These migrations highlight a dynamical pathway connecting Centaurs and JFCs with quasi-Hildas and, potentially, active asteroids. Synthesizing these results with our thermodynamical modeling and new activity observations, we find volatile sublimation is the primary activity mechanism. Observations of a quiescent 282P, which we anticipate will be possible in 2023, will help confirm our hypothesis by measuring a rotation period and ascertaining the spectral type. <SUP>*</SUP> Based on observations obtained at the international Gemini Observatory, a program of NSF's NOIRLab, which is managed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation on behalf of the Gemini Observatory partnership: the National Science Foundation (United States), National Research Council (Canada), Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (Chile), Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (Argentina), Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia, Inovações e Comunicações (Brazil), and Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (Republic of Korea). <SUP>**</SUP> Magellan telescope time was granted by NSF's NOIRLab, through the Telescope System Instrumentation Program (TSIP).

Photometrically Classified Superluminous Supernovae from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey: A Case Study for Science with Machine-learning-based Classification;;With the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), it is expected that only ~0.1% of all transients will be classified spectroscopically. To conduct studies of rare transients, such as Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), we must instead rely on photometric classification. In this vein, here we carry out a pilot study of SLSNe from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1-MDS), classified photometrically with our SuperRAENN and Superphot algorithms. We first construct a subsample of the photometric sample using a list of simple selection metrics designed to minimize contamination and ensure sufficient data quality for modeling. We then fit the multiband light curves with a magnetar spin-down model using the Modular Open-Source Fitter for Transients (MOSFiT). Comparing the magnetar engine and ejecta parameter distributions of the photometric sample to those of the PS1-MDS spectroscopic sample and a larger literature spectroscopic sample, we find that these samples are consistent overall, but that the photometric sample extends to slower spins and lower ejecta masses, which correspond to lower-luminosity events, as expected for photometric selection. While our PS1-MDS photometric sample is still smaller than the overall SLSN spectroscopic sample, our methodology paves the way for an orders-of-magnitude increase in the SLSN sample in the LSST era through photometric selection and study.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...937...13H
The Tidal Disruption Event AT2021ehb: Evidence of Relativistic Disk Reflection, and Rapid Evolution of the Disk-Corona System;;We present X-ray, UV, optical, and radio observations of the nearby (≈78 Mpc) tidal disruption event AT2021ehb/ZTF21aanxhjv during its first 430 days of evolution. AT2021ehb occurs in the nucleus of a galaxy hosting a≈10<SUP>7</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> black hole (M <SUB>BH</SUB> inferred from host galaxy scaling relations). High-cadence Swift and Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) monitoring reveals a delayed X-ray brightening. The spectrum first undergoes a gradual soft → hard transition and then suddenly turns soft again within 3 days at δ t≈272 days during which the X-ray flux drops by a factor of 10. In the joint NICER+NuSTAR observation (δ t = 264 days, harder state), we observe a prominent nonthermal component up to 30 keV and an extremely broad emission line in the iron K band. The bolometric luminosity of AT2021ehb reaches a maximum of ${6.0}_{-3.8}^{+10.4} \% {L}_{\mathrm{Edd}}$ when the X-ray spectrum is the hardest. During the dramatic X-ray evolution, no radio emission is detected, the UV/optical luminosity stays relatively constant, and the optical spectra are featureless. We propose the following interpretations: (i) the soft → hard transition may be caused by the gradual formation of a magnetically dominated corona; (ii) hard X-ray photons escape from the system along solid angles with low scattering optical depth (~a few) whereas the UV/optical emission is likely generated by reprocessing materials with much larger column density-the system is highly aspherical; and (iii) the abrupt X-ray flux drop may be triggered by the thermal-viscous instability in the inner accretion flow, leading to a much thinner disk.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...937....8Y
Radio Nebulae from Hyperaccreting X-Ray Binaries as Common-envelope Precursors and Persistent Counterparts of Fast Radio Bursts;;Roche lobe overflow from a donor star onto a black hole or neutron star binary companion can evolve to a phase of unstable runaway mass transfer, lasting as short as hundreds of orbits (≲10<SUP>2</SUP> yr for a giant donor) and eventually culminating in a common-envelope event. The highly super-Eddington accretion rates achieved during this brief phase ( $\dot{M}rsim {10}^{5}{\dot{M}}_{\mathrm{Edd}})$ are accompanied by intense mass loss in disk winds, analogous to but even more extreme than ultraluminous X-ray (ULX) sources in the nearby universe. Also in analogy with the observed ULX, this expanding outflow will inflate an energetic "bubble" of plasma into the circumbinary medium. Embedded within this bubble is a nebula of relativistic electrons heated at the termination shock of the faster v ≳ 0.1c wind/jet from the inner accretion flow. We present a time-dependent, one-zone model for the synchrotron radio emission and other observable properties of such ULX "hypernebulae." If ULX jets are sources of repeating fast radio bursts (FRB), as recently proposed, such hypernebulae could generate persistent radio emission and contribute large and time-variable rotation measure to the bursts, consistent with those seen from FRB 20121102 and FRB 20190520B. ULX hypernebulae can be discovered independently of an FRB association in radio surveys, such as VLASS, as off-nuclear point sources whose fluxes can evolve significantly on timescales as short as years, possibly presaging energetic transients from common-envelope mergers.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...937....5S
A Mid-infrared Flare in the Seyfert Galaxy NGC 3786: A Changing-look Event Triggered by an Obscured Tidal Disruption Event?;;We report an exceptional mid-infrared flare in the Seyfert 1.8 NGC 3786. In the multiepoch data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the nuclear mid-infrared brightness of NGC 3786 appears to vary substantially up to 0.5-0.8 mag around mid-2020. However, there is no evidence of significant variation in the corresponding light curve of the optical band from the Zwicky Transient Facility. This implies that the flare may have been heavily obscured by nuclear dust. Through follow-up spectroscopic observations with Gemini-North after the flare, we find that broad emission lines in Paα and Paβ newly appear, while the broad Hβ emission is marginally detected in the postflare spectrum. In addition, their central wavelengths are systematically redshifted up to 900 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> with respect to the narrow emission lines. This reveals that the flare is associated with the changing-look phenomenon from type 1.8 to type 1. Based on these findings, we argue that the flare is likely to originate from an obscured tidal disruption event, although extreme variation in the accretion rate may not be ruled out completely.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...937....3S
Image Subtraction in Fourier Space;;Image subtraction is essential for transient detection in time-domain astronomy. The point-spread function (PSF), photometric scaling, and sky background generally vary with time and across the field of view for imaging data taken with ground-based optical telescopes. Image subtraction algorithms need to match these variations for the detection of flux variability. An algorithm that can be fully parallelized is highly desirable for future time-domain surveys. Here we introduce the saccadic fast Fourier transform (SFFT) algorithm we developed for image differencing. SFFT uses a δ-function basis for kernel decomposition, and the image subtraction is performed in Fourier space. This brings about a remarkable improvement in computational performance of about an order of magnitude compared to other published image subtraction codes. SFFT can accommodate the spatial variations in wide-field imaging data, including PSF, photometric scaling, and sky background. However, the flexibility of the δ-function basis may also make it more prone to overfitting. The algorithm has been tested extensively on real astronomical data taken by a variety of telescopes. Moreover, the SFFT code allows for the spatial variations of the PSF and sky background to be fitted by spline functions.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936..157H
Searching for Cataclysmic Variable Stars in Unidentified X-Ray Sources;;We carry out a photometric search for new cataclysmic variable stars (CVs), with the goal of identification for candidates of AR Scorpii-type binary systems. We select GAIA sources that are likely associated with unidentified X-ray sources, and analyze the light curves taken by the Zwicky Transient Facility, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, and Lulin One-meter Telescope in Taiwan. We investigate eight sources as candidates for CVs, among which six sources are new identifications. Another two sources have been recognized as CVs in previous studies, but no detailed investigations have been done. We identify two eclipsing systems that are associated with an unidentified XMM-Newton or Swift source, and one promising candidate for polar associated with an unidentified ASKA source. Two polar candidates may locate in the so-called period gap of a CV, and the other six candidates have an orbital period shorter than that of the period gap. Although we do not identify a promising candidate for AR Scorpii-type binary systems, our study suggests that CV systems that have X-ray emission and do not show frequent outbursts may have been missed in previous surveys.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936..134T
The Rate and Spatial Distribution of Novae in M31 as Determined by a 20 Year Survey;;A long-term (1995-2016) survey for novae in the nearby Andromeda galaxy (M31) was conducted as part of the Research-Based Science Education initiative. During the course of the survey 180 nights of observation were completed at Kitt Peak, Arizona. A total of 262 novae were either discovered or confirmed, 40 of which have not been previously reported. Of these, 203 novae form a spatially complete sample detected by the KPNO/WIYN 0.9 m telescope within a $20^{\prime} \times 20^{\prime} $ field centered on the nucleus of M31. An additional 50 novae are part of a spatially complete sample detected by the KPNO 4 m telescope within a larger $36^{\prime} \times 36^{\prime} $ field. Consistent with previous studies, it is found that the spatial distribution of novae in both surveys follows the bulge light of M31 somewhat more closely than the overall background light of the galaxy. After correcting for the limiting magnitude and the spatial and temporal coverage of the surveys, a final nova rate in M31 is found to be $R={40}_{-4}^{+5}$ yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is considerably lower than recent estimates. When normalized to the K-band luminosity of M31, this value yields a luminosity-specific nova rate, ν <SUB> K </SUB> = 3.3 ± 0.4 yr ${}^{-1}\,{[{10}^{10}\,{L}_{\odot ,K}]}^{-1}$ . By scaling the M31 nova rate using the relative infrared luminosities of M31 and our Galaxy, a nova rate of ${R}_{{\rm{G}}}={28}_{-4}^{+5}$ yr<SUP>-1</SUP> is found for the Milky Way.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936..117R
Constraints on the Spindown of Fully Convective M Dwarfs Using Wide Field Binaries;;M dwarfs remain active over longer timescales than their Sunlike counterparts, with potentially devastating implications for the atmospheres of their planets. However, the age at which fully convective M dwarfs transition from active and rapidly rotating to quiescent and slowly rotating is poorly understood, as these stars remain rapidly rotating in the oldest clusters that are near enough for a large sample of low-mass M dwarfs to be studied. To constrain the spindown of these low-mass stars, we measure photometric rotation periods for field M dwarfs in wide binary systems, primarily using the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and MEarth. Our analysis includes M-M pairs, which are coeval but of unknown age, as well as M dwarfs with white dwarf or Sunlike primaries, for which we can estimate ages using techniques like white-dwarf cooling curves, gyrochronology, and lithium abundance. We find that the epoch of spindown is strongly dependent on mass. Fully convective M dwarfs initially spin down slowly, with the population of 0.2-0.3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> rapid rotators evolving from P <SUB>rot</SUB> < 2 days at 600 Myr to 2 < P <SUB>rot</SUB> < 10 days at 1-3 Gyr before rapidly spinning down to long rotation periods at older ages. However, we also identify some variability in the spindown of fully convective M dwarfs, with a small number of stars having substantially spun down by 600 Myr. These observations are consistent with models of magnetic morphology-driven spindown, where angular momentum loss is initially inefficient until changes in the magnetic field allow spindown to progress rapidly.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936..109P
Variability-selected Intermediate-mass Black Hole Candidates in Dwarf Galaxies from ZTF and WISE;;While it is difficult to observe the first black hole seeds in the early universe, we can study intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in local dwarf galaxies for clues about their origins. In this paper we present a sample of variability-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) in dwarf galaxies using optical photometry from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and forward-modeled mid-IR photometry of time-resolved Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) co-added images. We found that 44 out of 25,714 dwarf galaxies had optically variable AGN candidates and 148 out of 79,879 dwarf galaxies had mid-IR variable AGN candidates, corresponding to active fractions of 0.17% ± 0.03% and 0.19% ± 0.02%, respectively. We found that spectroscopic approaches to AGN identification would have missed 81% of our ZTF IMBH candidates and 69% of our WISE IMBH candidates. Only nine candidates have been detected previously in radio, X-ray, and variability searches for dwarf galaxy AGN. The ZTF and WISE dwarf galaxy AGN with broad Balmer lines have virial masses of 10<SUP>5</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> < M <SUB>BH</SUB> < 10<SUP>7</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, but for the rest of the sample, BH masses predicted from host galaxy mass range between 10<SUP>5.2</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> < M <SUB>BH</SUB> < 10<SUP>7.25</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. We found that only 5 of 152 previously reported variability-selected AGN candidates from the Palomar Transient Factory in common with our parent sample were variable in ZTF. We also determined a nuclear supernova fraction of 0.05% ± 0.01% yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for dwarf galaxies in ZTF. Our ZTF and WISE IMBH candidates show the promise of variability searches for the discovery of otherwise hidden low-mass AGN.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936..104W
NuSTAR Observations of Intrinsically X-Ray Weak Quasar Candidates: An Obscuration-only Scenario;;We utilize recent NuSTAR observations (co-added depth ≈55-120 ks) of PG 1001+054, PG 1254+047, and PHL 1811 to constrain their hard X-ray (≳5 keV) weakness and spectral shapes and thus to investigate the nature of their extreme X-ray weakness. These quasars showed very weak soft X-ray emission, and they were proposed to be intrinsically X-ray weak, with the X-ray coronae producing weak continuum emission relative to their optical/UV emission. However, the new observations suggest an alternative explanation. The NuSTAR 3-24 keV spectral shapes for PG 1001+054 and PHL 1811 are likely flat (effective power-law photon indices ${{\rm{\Gamma }}}_{\mathrm{eff}}={1.0}_{-0.6}^{+0.5}$ and ${{\rm{\Gamma }}}_{\mathrm{eff}}={1.4}_{-0.7}^{+0.8}$ , respectively), while the shape is nominal for PG 1254+047 (Γ<SUB>eff</SUB> = 1.8 ± 0.3). PG 1001+054 and PHL 1811 are significantly weak at hard X-ray energies (by factors of ≈26-74 at rest-frame 8 keV) compared to the expectations from their optical/UV emission, while PG 1254+047 is only hard X-ray weak by a factor of ≈3. We suggest that X-ray obscuration is present in all three quasars. We propose that, as an alternative to the intrinsic X-ray weakness + X-ray obscuration scenario, the soft and hard X-ray weakness of these quasars can be uniformly explained under an obscuration-only scenario. This model provides adequate descriptions of the multiepoch soft and hard X-ray data of these quasars, with variable column density and leaked fraction of the partial covering absorber. We suggest that the absorber is the clumpy dust-free wind launched from the accretion disk. These quasars probably have super-Eddington accretion rates that drive powerful and high-density winds.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936...95W
Velocity-resolved Reverberation Mapping of Changing-look Active Galactic Nucleus NGC 4151 during Outburst Stage: Evidence for Kinematics Evolution of Broad-line Region;;Changing-look active galactic nucleus NGC 4151, which has attracted a lot of attention, is undergoing the second dramatic outburst stage in its evolutionary history. To investigate the geometry and kinematics of the broad-line region (BLR), and measure the mass of supermassive black hole in NGC 4151, we perform a 7 month photometric and spectroscopic monitoring program in 2020-2021, using the 2.4 m telescope at Lijiang Observatory. We successfully measure the time lags of the responses from broad Hα, Hβ, Hγ, He I, and He II emission lines to continuum variation, which are ${7.63}_{-2.62}^{+1.85}$ , ${6.21}_{-1.13}^{+1.41}$ , ${5.67}_{-1.94}^{+1.65}$ , ${1.59}_{-1.11}^{+0.86}$ , and ${0.46}_{-1.06}^{+1.22}$ days, respectively, following radial stratification. The ratios of time lags among these lines are 1.23: 1.00: 0.91: 0.26: 0.07. We find that the continuum lag between the ultraviolet and optical bands can significantly affect the lag measurements of He I and He II. Virial and infalling gas motions coexist in this campaign, which is different from previous results, implying the evolutionary kinematics of BLR. Based on our measurements and previous ones in the literature, we confirm that the BLR of NGC 4151 is basically virialized. Finally, we compute the black hole mass through multiple lines, and the measurement from Hβ to be ${3.94}_{-0.72}^{+0.90}\times {10}^{7}{M}_{\odot }$ , which is consistent with previous results. The corresponding accretion rate is ${0.02}_{-0.01}^{+0.01}{L}_{\mathrm{Edd}}{c}^{-2}$ , implying a sub-Eddington accretor.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936...75L
A Multi-epoch, Multiwavelength Study of the Classical FUor V1515 Cyg Approaching Quiescence;;Historically, FU Orionis-type stars are low-mass, pre-main-sequence stars. The members of this class experience powerful accretion outbursts and remain in an enhanced accretion state for decades or centuries. V1515 Cyg, a classical FUor, started brightening in the 1940s and reached its peak brightness in the late 1970s. Following a sudden decrease in brightness, it stayed in a minimum state for a few months, then started brightening for several years. We present the results of our ground-based photometric monitoring complemented with optical/near-infrared spectroscopic monitoring. Our light curves show a long-term fading with strong variability on weekly and monthly timescales. The optical spectra show P Cygni profiles and broad blueshifted absorption lines, common properties of FUors. However, V1515 Cyg lacks the P Cygni profile in the Ca II 8498 Å line, a part of the Ca infrared triplet, formed by an outflowing wind, suggesting that the absorbing gas in the wind is optically thin. The newly obtained near-infrared spectrum shows the strengthening of the CO bandhead and the FeH molecular band, indicating that the disk has become cooler since the last spectroscopic observation in 2015. The current luminosity of the accretion disk dropped from the peak value of 138 L <SUB>⊙</SUB> to about 45 L <SUB>⊙</SUB>, suggesting that the long-term fading is also partly caused by the dropping of the accretion rate.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936...64S
Modeling Long-term Variability in Stellar-compact Object Binary Systems for Mass Determinations;;This work models the effects of gravitational lensing, Doppler boosting, and ellipsoidal variations on eccentric eclipsing binary-system light curves. This is accomplished using a Newtonian orbital-motion code that simulates the orbital velocities and separation of the binary components as a function of time. Improving on previous literature, we examine the effects of orbital eccentricity and period, as well as stellar limb darkening on the expected light curves. Whether lensing, Doppler boosting, or ellipsoidal variation is dominant in the light curves is a function of the separation between the binary components; thus, the combination of all three effects allows for a unique mass-determination method that greatly expands the parameter space for the discovery of compact objects. This suggests the exciting possibility of revealing a large population of nonaccreting compact objects in galactic binary systems. At the same time, the model can be used on systems exhibiting any subset of these effects. In a case study, we fit our model to optical data from the ellipsoidal variable binary system Cygnus X-1, and we compare our determinations with those previously found by different modeling techniques.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936...63S
A White Dwarf-Main-sequence Binary Unveiled by Time-domain Observations from LAMOST and TESS;;We report a single-lined white dwarf-main-sequence binary system, LAMOST J172900.17+652952.8, which is discovered by the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST)'s medium-resolution time-domain surveys. The radial-velocity semi-amplitude and orbital period of the optical visible star are measured by using follow-up observations with the Palomar 200 inch telescope and light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Thus the mass function of the invisible candidate white dwarf is derived, f(M <SUB>2</SUB>) = 0.120 ± 0.003 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The mass of the visible star is measured based on a spectral energy distribution fitting, M <SUB>1</SUB> = ${0.81}_{-0.06}^{+0.07}\,{M}_{\odot }$ . Hence, the mass of its invisible companion is M <SUB>2</SUB> ≳ 0.63 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The companion ought to be a compact object rather than a main-sequence star owing to the mass ratio q = M <SUB>2</SUB>/M <SUB>1</SUB> ≳ 0.78 and the single-lined spectra. The compact object is likely to be a white dwarf if the inclination angle is not small, i ≳ 40°. By using the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) near-UV flux, the effective temperature of the white dwarf candidate is constrained as ${T}_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\mathrm{WD}}$ ≲ 12,000-13,500 K. It is difficult to detect white dwarfs which are outshone by their bright companions via single-epoch optical spectroscopic surveys. Therefore, optical time-domain surveys can play an important role in unveiling invisible white dwarfs and other compact objects in binaries.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936...33Z
TIC 452991707 and TIC 452991693 as a Candidate Sextuple System with Three Eclipsing Binaries;;We present the discovery of a rare system detected in the TESS data showing three different eclipsing-like signals. TIC 452991707 and TIC 452991693 seem to be the second such system on the sky, whose two components separated about 16" are gravitationally bounded, or comprise a co-moving pair. The three periods detected from the TESS data are: P<SUB>A</SUB>=1.46155 d, P<sun>B=1.77418 d, and P<sun>C=1.03989 d, respectively. The A and B periods belong to TIC 452991707, while the C comes from the component TIC 452991693. The pair A shows the deepest eclipses, and its orbit is very slightly eccentric. The third period C has lowest amplitude (eclipsing or ellipsoidal nature), but originates from TIC 452991693, which is connected to A+B because both visual components share similar proper motion and distance. Long-term collection of data from older photometry from various surveys also shows that the two inner pairs A and B orbit around their barycenter. Its period is probably of a few years, but for a final derivation of its orbital parameters one needs more up-to-date data. Hence, we call for new observations of this amazing system.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AcA....72..103Z
High-Energy Extragalactic Neutrino Astrophysics;;The detection of an astrophysical flux of neutrinos in the TeV-PeV energy range by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has opened new possibilities for the study of extreme cosmic accelerators. The apparent isotropy of the neutrino arrival directions favors an extragalactic origin for this flux, potentially created by a large population of distant sources. Recent evidence for the detection of neutrino emission from extragalactic sources includes the active galaxies TXS 0506+056 and NGC 1068. We here review the current status of the search for the sources of the high-energy neutrino flux, concentrating on its extragalactic contribution. We discuss the implications of these observations for multimessenger studies of cosmic sources and present an outlook for how additional observations by current and future instruments will help address fundamental questions in the emerging field of high-energy neutrino astronomy.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ARNPS..72..365K
Searching the SETI Ellipsoid with Gaia;;The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) Ellipsoid is a geometric method for prioritizing technosignature observations based on the strategy of receiving signals synchronized to conspicuous astronomical events. Precise distances to nearby stars from Gaia makes constraining Ellipsoid crossing times possible. Here we explore the utility of using the Gaia Catalog of Nearby Stars to select targets on the SN 1987A SETI Ellipsoid, as well as the Ellipsoids defined by 278 classical novae. Less than 8% of stars within the 100 pc sample are inside the SN 1987A SETI Ellipsoid, meaning the vast majority of nearby stars are still viable targets for monitoring over time. We find an average of 734 stars per year within the 100 pc volume will intersect the Ellipsoid from SN 1987A, with ~10% of those having distance uncertainties from Gaia better than 0.1 lyr.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..117D
TESS Hunt for Young and Maturing Exoplanets (THYME). VII. Membership, Rotation, and Lithium in the Young Cluster Group-X and a New Young Exoplanet;;The public, all-sky surveys Gaia and TESS provide the ability to identify new young associations and determine their ages. These associations enable study of planetary evolution by providing new opportunities to discover young exoplanets. A young association was recently identified by Tang et al. and Fürnkranz et al. using astrometry from Gaia (called "Group-X" by the former). In this work, we investigate the age and membership of this association, and we validate the exoplanet TOI 2048 b, which was identified to transit a young, late G dwarf in Group-X using photometry from TESS. We first identified new candidate members of Group-X using Gaia EDR3 data. To infer the age of the association, we measured rotation periods for candidate members using TESS data. The clear color-period sequence indicates that the association is the same age as the 300 ± 50 Myr old NGC 3532. We obtained optical spectra for candidate members that show lithium absorption consistent with this young age. Further, we serendipitously identify a new, small association nearby Group-X, which we call MELANGE-2. Lastly, we statistically validate TOI 2048 b, which is a 2.1 ± 0.2 R <SUB>⊕</SUB> radius planet on a 13.8-day orbit around its 300 Myr old host star.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..115N
India's First Robotic Eye for Time-domain Astrophysics: The GROWTH-India Telescope;;We present the design and performance of the GROWTH-India telescope, a 0.7 m robotic telescope dedicated to time-domain astronomy. The telescope is equipped with a 4k back-illuminated camera that gives a 0.°82 field of view and a sensitivity of m <SUB>g'</SUB> ~ 20.5 in 5 minute exposures. Custom software handles observatory operations: attaining high on-sky observing efficiencies (≳80%) and allowing rapid response to targets of opportunity. The data processing pipelines are capable of performing point-spread function photometry as well as image subtraction for transient searches. We also present an overview of the GROWTH-India telescope's contributions to the studies of gamma-ray bursts, the electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave sources, supernovae, novae, and solar system objects.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164...90K
TOI-3757 b: A Low-density Gas Giant Orbiting a Solar-metallicity M Dwarf;;We present the discovery of a new Jovian-sized planet, TOI-3757 b, the lowest-density transiting planet known to orbit an M dwarf (M0V). This planet was discovered around a solar-metallicity M dwarf, using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite photometry and confirmed with precise radial velocities from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) and NEID. With a planetary radius of 12.0 ${}_{-0.5}^{+0.4}$ R <SUB>⊕</SUB> and mass of 85.3 ${}_{-8.7}^{+8.8}$ M <SUB>⊕</SUB>, not only does this object add to the small sample of gas giants (~10) around M dwarfs, but also its low density ( $\rho ={0.27}_{-0.04}^{+0.05}$ g cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) provides an opportunity to test theories of planet formation. We present two hypotheses to explain its low density; first, we posit that the low metallicity of its stellar host (~0.3 dex lower than the median metallicity of M dwarfs hosting gas giants) could have played a role in the delayed formation of a solid core massive enough to initiate runaway accretion. Second, using the eccentricity estimate of 0.14 ± 0.06, we determine it is also plausible for tidal heating to at least partially be responsible for inflating the radius of TOI-3757b b. The low density and large scale height of TOI-3757 b makes it an excellent target for transmission spectroscopy studies of atmospheric escape and composition (transmission spectroscopy measurement of ~ 190). We use HPF to perform transmission spectroscopy of TOI-3757 b using the helium 10830 Å line. Doing this, we place an upper limit of 6.9% (with 90% confidence) on the maximum depth of the absorption from the metastable transition of He at ~10830 Å, which can help constraint the atmospheric mass-loss rate in this energy-limited regime.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164...81K
X-ray view of a merging supermassive black hole binary candidate SDSS J1430+2303: Results from the first ∼200 days of observations;;Context. Recently we discovered an unprecedented supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) candidate in the nearby Seyfert galaxy SDSS J1430+2303, which is predicted to merge within three years. X-ray spectroscopy may bring unique kinematic evidence for the last inspiraling stage, when the binary is too close to allow each of them to hold an individual broad line region. 
 Aims: We try to confirm the unique SMBHB merger event and understand the associated high-energy processes from a comprehensive X-ray view. 
 Methods: We observed SDSS J1430+2303 with XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, Chandra, and Swift spanning the first ∼200 days since its discovery. 
 Results: X-ray variability, up to a factor of 7, has been detected on a timescale of a few days. The broadband spectrum from 0.2-70 keV can be well fitted with a model consisting of a power law and a relativistic reflection covered by a warm absorber. The properties of the warm absorber changed dramatically, for example, with a decrease in the line-of-sight velocity from ∼0.2c to ∼0.02c, between the two XMM-Newton observations separated by only 19 days, which can be naturally understood in the context of the SMBHB; although, the clumpy wind scenario cannot be completely excluded. Broad Fe Kα emission has been robustly detected, though its velocity shift or profile change is not yet measurable. Further longer X-ray observations are highly encouraged to detect the expected orbital motion of the binary.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...665L...3D
Accretion flows around exotic tidal wormholes. I. Ray-tracing;;
 Aims: This paper investigates the various spherically symmetric wormhole solutions in the presence of tidal forces and applies numerous methods, such as test particle orbital dynamics, ray-tracing, and microlensing. 
 Methods: We make theoretical predictions on the test particle orbital motion around the tidal wormholes with the use of the effective potential normalized by ℒ<SUP>2</SUP>. In order to obtain the ray-tracing images of both geometrically thin and thick accretion disks and relativistic jets, we modified the open source GYOTO code using a python interface. 
 Results: We applied this technique to probe the accretion flows near Schwarzschild-like and charged Reissner-Nordström (RN) wormholes; we assumed both a charged RN wormhole and a special case with a vanishing electromagnetic charge, namely the Damour-Solodukhin (DS) wormhole. We show that the photon sphere for the Schwarzschild-like wormhole present for both thin and thick accretion disks, even for the vanishing tidal forces. Moreover, we observe that r<SUB>ph</SUB> → ∞ as α → ∞, which constraints the α parameter to be sufficiently small and positive in order to respect Event Horizon Telescope observations. On the other hand, for the case of the RN wormhole, the photon sphere radius shrinks as Λ → ∞, as predicted by the effective potential. In addition to the accretion disks, we also probe the relativistic jets around the two wormhole solutions under consideration. Finally, with the help of star bulb microlensing, we approximate the radius of the wormhole shadow and find that for the Schwarzschild wormhole, R<SUB>Sh</SUB> ≈ r<SUB>0</SUB> for zero tidal forces and grows linearly with α. On the contrary, the shadow radius for charged wormholes slowly decreases with the growing DS parameter, Λ.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...665A.139S
Testing the homogeneity of type Ia Supernovae in near-infrared for accurate distance estimations;;Since the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe more than two decades ago, Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) have been extensively used as standardisable candles in the optical. However, SNe Ia have shown to be more homogeneous in the near-infrared (NIR), where the effect of dust extinction is also attenuated. In this work, we explore the possibility of using a low number of NIR observations for accurate distance estimations, given the homogeneity at these wavelengths. We found that one epoch in J and/or H band, plus good gr-band coverage, gives an accurate estimation of peak magnitudes in the J (J<SUB>max</SUB>) and H (H<SUB>max</SUB>) bands. The use of a single NIR epoch only introduces an additional scatter of ∼0.05 mag for epochs around the time of B-band peak magnitude (T<SUB>max</SUB>). We also tested the effect of optical cadence and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the estimation of T<SUB>max</SUB> and its uncertainty propagation to the NIR peak magnitudes. Both cadence and S/N have a similar contribution, where we constrained the introduced scatter of each to < 0.02 mag in J<SUB>max</SUB> and < 0.01 in H<SUB>max</SUB>. However, these effects are expected to be negligible, provided the data quality is comparable to that obtained for observations of nearby SNe (z ≲ 0.1). The effect of S/N in the NIR was tested as well. For SNe Ia at 0.08 < z ≲ 0.1, NIR observations with better S/N than that found in the CSP sample is necessary to constrain the introduced scatter to a minimum (≲0.05 mag). These results provide confidence for our FLOWS project that is aimed at using SNe Ia with public ZTF optical light curves and few NIR epochs to map out the peculiar velocity field of the local Universe. This will allow us to determine the distribution of dark matter in our own supercluster, Laniakea, and to test the standard cosmological model by measuring the growth rate of structures, parameterised by fD, and the Hubble-Lemaître constant, H<SUB>0</SUB>.

A detailed analysis of the Gl 486 planetary system;;Context. The Gl 486 system consists of a very nearby, relatively bright, weakly active M3.5 V star at just 8 pc with a warm transiting rocky planet of about 1.3 R<SUB>⊕</SUB> and 3.0 M<SUB>⊕</SUB>. It is ideal for both transmission and emission spectroscopy and for testing interior models of telluric planets. 
 Aims: To prepare for future studies, we aim to thoroughly characterise the planetary system with new accurate and precise data collected with state-of-the-art photometers from space and spectrometers and interferometers from the ground. 
 Methods: We collected light curves of seven new transits observed with the CHEOPS space mission and new radial velocities obtained with MAROON-X at the 8.1 m Gemini North telescope and CARMENES at the 3.5 m Calar Alto telescope, together with previously published spectroscopic and photometric data from the two spectrographs and TESS. We also performed near-infrared interferometric observations with the CHARA Array and new photometric monitoring with a suite of smaller telescopes (AstroLAB, LCOGT, OSN, TJO). This extraordinary and rich data set was the input for our comprehensive analysis. 
 Results: From interferometry, we measure a limb-darkened disc angular size of the star Gl 486 at θ<SUB>LDD</SUB> = 0.390 ± 0.018 mas. Together with a corrected Gaia EDR3 parallax, we obtain a stellar radius R<SUB>*</SUB> = 0.339 ± 0.015 R<SUB>⊕</SUB>. We also measure a stellar rotation period at P<SUB>rot</SUB> = 49.9 ± 5.5 days, an upper limit to its XUV (5-920 A) flux informed by new Hubble/STIS data, and, for the first time, a variety of element abundances (Fe, Mg, Si, V, Sr, Zr, Rb) and C/O ratio. Moreover, we imposed restrictive constraints on the presence of additional components, either stellar or sub-stellar, in the system. With the input stellar parameters and the radial-velocity and transit data, we determine the radius and mass of the planet Gl 486 b at R<SUB>p</SUB> = 1.343<SUB>−0.062</SUB><SUP>+0.063</SUP> R<SUB>⊕</SUB> and M<SUB>p</SUB> = 3.00<SUB>−0.12</SUB><SUP>+0.13</SUP> M<SUB>⊕</SUB>, with relative uncertainties of the planet radius and mass of 4.7% and 4.2%, respectively. From the planet parameters and the stellar element abundances, we infer the most probable models of planet internal structure and composition, which are consistent with a relatively small metallic core with respect to the Earth, a deep silicate mantle, and a thin volatile upper layer. With all these ingredients, we outline prospects for Gl 486 b atmospheric studies, especially with forthcoming James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) observations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...665A.120C
SNGuess: A method for the selection of young extragalactic transients;;Context. With a rapidly rising number of transients detected in astronomy, classification methods based on machine learning are increasingly being employed. Their goals are typically to obtain a definitive classification of transients, and for good performance they usually require the presence of a large set of observations. However, well-designed, targeted models can reach their classification goals with fewer computing resources. 
 Aims: The aim of this study is to assist in the observational astronomy task of deciding whether a newly detected transient warrants follow-up observations. 
 Methods: This paper presents SNGuess, a model designed to find young extragalactic nearby transients with high purity. SNGuess works with a set of features that can be efficiently calculated from astronomical alert data. Some of these features are static and associated with the alert metadata, while others must be calculated from the photometric observations contained in the alert. Most of the features are simple enough to be obtained or to be calculated already at the early stages in the lifetime of a transient after its detection. We calculate these features for a set of labeled public alert data obtained over a time span of 15 months from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The core model of SNGuess consists of an ensemble of decision trees, which are trained via gradient boosting. 
 Results: Approximately 88% of the candidates suggested by SNGuess from a set of alerts from ZTF spanning from April 2020 to August 2021 were found to be true relevant supernovae (SNe). For alerts with bright detections, this number ranges between 92% and 98%. Since April 2020, transients identified by SNGuess as potential young SNe in the ZTF alert stream are being published to the Transient Name Server (TNS) under the AMPEL_ZTF_NEW group identifier. SNGuess scores for any transient observed by ZTF can be accessed via a web service <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ampel.zeuthen.desy.de/api/live/docs">https://ampel.zeuthen.desy.de/api/live/docs</ext-link>. The source code of SNGuess is publicly available <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nmiranda/SNGuess">https://github.com/nmiranda/SNGuess</ext-link>. 
 Conclusions: SNGuess is a lightweight, portable, and easily re-trainable model that can effectively suggest transients for follow-up. These properties make it a useful tool for optimizing follow-up observation strategies and for assisting humans in the process of selecting candidate transients.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...665A..99M
Surface Properties of Near-Sun Asteroids;;Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) with small perihelion distances reach subsolar temperatures of ≥1000 K. They are hypothesized to undergo "supercatastrophic" disruption, potentially caused by near-Sun processes such as thermal cracking, spin-up, meteoroid impacts, and subsurface volatile release, all of which are likely to cause surface alteration, which may change the spectral slope of the surface. We attempted to observe 35 of the 53 known near-Sun asteroids with q ≤ 0.15 au from 2017 January to 2020 March to search for trends related to near-Sun processes. We report the optical colors and spectral slopes of 22 objects that we successfully observed and the measured rotation periods for three objects. We find the distribution of colors to be overall bluer than the color distribution of NEAs, though there is a large overlap. We attribute the large scatter to unknown dynamical histories and compositions for individual objects, as well as competing surface altering processes. We also investigated potential correlations between colors and other properties (e.g., perihelion distance, Tisserand parameter, rotation period) and searched for evidence of activity. Finally, we have compiled all known physical and dynamical properties of these objects, including probabilistic source regions and dwell times with q ≤ 0.15 au.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PSJ.....3..187H
Deep-learning real/bogus classification for the Tomo-e Gozen transient survey;;We present a deep neural network real/bogus classifier that improves classification performance in the Tomo-e Gozen Transient survey by handling label errors in the training data. In the wide-field, high-frequency transient survey with Tomo-e Gozen, the performance of conventional convolutional neural network classifiers is not sufficient as about 10<SUP>6</SUP> bogus detections appear every night. In need of a better classifier, we have developed a new two-stage training method. In this training method, label errors in the training data are first detected by normal supervised learning classification, and then they are unlabeled and used for training of semi-supervised learning. For actual observed data, the classifier with this method achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9998 and a false positive rate (FPR) of 0.0002 at a true positive rate (TPR) of 0.9. This training method saves relabeling effort by humans and works better on training data with a high fraction of label errors. By implementing the developed classifier in the Tomo-e Gozen pipeline, the number of transient candidates was reduced to ~40 objects per night, which is ~1/130 of the previous version, while maintaining the recovery rate of real transients. This enables more efficient selection of targets for follow-up observations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASJ...74..946T
Automatic detection of accretion bursts in young stellar objects: A new algorithm for long-term sky surveys;;Young stellar objects in their pre-main sequence phase are characterized by irregular changes in brightness, generally attributed to an increase of the mass accretion rate due to various kind of instabilities occurring in the circumstellar disk. In the era of large surveys aimed to monitor the sky, we present a pipeline to detect irregular bursts, in particular EXors-like (EX Lupi type eruptive variables), in the light curves. The procedure follows a heuristic approach and is tested against the light curves already collected for a few objects presently recognized as bona fide or candidate EXors.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022NewA...9501813S
Supernovae and their cosmological implications;;Supernovae (SNe) are luminous optical transients, which, despite being rare events in a single galaxy, nowadays are discovered at a rate of ten per day. They populate a growing zoo of different types linked to a variety of progenitors and explosion mechanisms. Through a biased selection of a century of researches, I will review how SNe have became a leading tool to probe the cosmic expansion. I will mainly focus on SNe of type Ia, originating from the thermonuclear explosion of white dwarfs, that were demonstrated to be excellent distance indicators after proper calibration and standardisation. Two decades ago, SNe Ia provided the surprising result that the cosmic expansion is accelerated by a misterious dark energy. Recently, with the decisive contribution of Cepheids variables as primary distance indicators, SN Ia allowed to measure the value of the Hubble-Lemaître constant, $$H_0$$ H 0 , with an error of only 1%. It turned out that the value of $$H_0$$ H 0 based on SNe Ia is in tension with the one measured through the fit of the CMB fluctuations. If confirmed, this finding requires a deep revision of the standard cosmological model.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022NCimR..45..549C
CoBiToM Project - II. Evolution of contact binary systems close to the orbital period cut-off;;Ultra-short orbital period contact binaries (P<SUB>orb</SUB> < 0.26 d) host some of the smallest and least massive stars. These systems are faint and rare, and it is believed that they have reached a contact configuration after several Gyrs of evolution via angular momentum loss, mass transfer, and mass loss through stellar wind processes. This study is conducted in the frame of the Contact Binaries Towards Merging (CoBiToM) Project and presents the results from light curve and orbital analysis of 30 ultra-short orbital period contact binaries, with the aim to investigate the possibility of them being red nova progenitors, eventually producing merger events. Approximately half of the systems exhibit orbital period modulations, as a result of mass transfer or mass loss processes. Although they are in contact, their fill-out factor is low (less than 30 per cent), while their mass ratio is larger than the one in longer period contact binaries. This study investigates the orbital stability of these systems and examines their physical and orbital parameters in comparison to those of the entire sample of known and well-studied contact binaries, based on combined spectroscopic and photometric analysis. It is found that ultra-short orbital period contact binaries have very stable orbits, while very often additional components are gravitationally bound in wide orbits around the central binary system. We confirmed that the evolution of such systems is very slow, which explains why the components of ultra-short orbital period systems are still Main Sequence stars after several Gyrs of evolution.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.5528L
Statistics of BY Draconis chromospheric variable stars;;We present an extensive catalogue of BY Draconis (BY Dra)-type variables and their stellar parameters. BY Dra are main-sequence FGKM-type stars. They exhibit inhomogeneous starspots and bright faculae in their photospheres. These features are caused by stellar magnetic fields, which are carried along with the stellar disc through rotation and which produce gradual modulations in their light curves (LCs). Our main objective is to characterize the properties of BY Dra variables over a wide range of stellar masses, temperatures, and rotation periods. A recent study categorized 84 697 BY Dra variables from Data Release 2 of the Zwicky Transient Facility based on their LCs. We have collected additional photometric data from multiple surveys and performed broad-band spectral energy distribution fits to estimate stellar parameters. We found that more than half of our sample objects are of K spectral type, covering an extensive range of stellar parameters in the low-mass regime (0.1-1.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). Compared with previous studies, most of the sources in our catalogue are rapid rotators, and so most of them must be young stars for which a spin-down has not yet occurred. We subdivided our catalogue based on convection zone depth and found that the photospheric activity index, S<SUB>ph</SUB>, is lower for higher effective temperatures, i.e. for thinner convective envelopes. We observe a broad range of photospheric magnetic activity for different spectral classes owing to the presence of stellar populations of different ages. We found a higher magnetically active fraction for K- than M-type stars.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.4932C
TSCat: data model and storage engine for AI-based light-curve analysis;;Light-curve data are one of the most important data sources in time domain astronomy research. With the advancement of observation facilities and the continuous accumulation of observation data, and considering the analysis needs of large sample data sets, software or tools based on new technologies, especially artificial intelligence (AI), will be indispensable for light-curve analysis. The light-curve analysis tool designed by an individual will follow its own defined data structure, which will make the tools designed and developed by different individuals incompatible. A unified light-curve data model will be able to solve this compatibility problem, similar to the traditional flexible image transport system (FITS) file format. This paper proposes a light-curve data model named TSCat, designs and implements a data storage engine. The TSCat data model defines the basic metadata and format required for storing optical curve data following the international virtual observatory alliance (IVOA) data format specification system. The TSCat storage engine implements basic operations such as importing, storing, and accessing light-curve data. The function and performance of the TSCat storage engine are evaluated through the actual observation data. The experimental results show that the TSCat data model is complete enough to support the analysis of light curves. TSCat will help support the standardization of the data access level of software and tools in the field of light-curve analysis, and provide a new reference for the specification system of astronomical scientific data formats.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.4756L
Could TDE outflows produce the PeV neutrino events?;;A tidal disruption event (TDE), AT2019dsg, was observed to be associated with a PeV neutrino event, IceCube-191001A, lagging the optical outburst by a half year. It is known that TDEs may generate ultra fast outflows. If the TDE occurs in a cloudy environment, the outflow-cloud interactions may form shock waves which generate accelerated protons and hence, delayed neutrinos from hadronic interactions in clouds. Here, we investigate the neutrino production in AT2019dsg by examining the TDE outflow-cloud interaction model. We find that, for an outflow with a velocity of 0.07 c and a kinetic luminosity of $10^{45}\rm \,erg\ \,s^{-1}$, protons may be accelerated up to ~60 PeV by the bow shocks, and generate PeV neutrinos by interactions with clouds. The predicted neutrino number in this model depends on the uncertainties of model parameters and in order to match the observations, some challenging values of parameters have been involved. The PeV neutrino event number can be ~4 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> for a hard proton index Γ = 1.5.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.4406W
TESS discovery of a sub-Neptune orbiting a mid-M dwarf TOI-2136;;We present the discovery of TOI-2136 b, a sub-Neptune planet transiting a nearby M4.5V-type star every 7.85 d, identified through photometric measurements from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. The host star is located 33 pc away with a radius of R<SUB>*</SUB> = 0.34 ± 0.02 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>, a mass of $0.34\pm 0.02 \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$, and an effective temperature of 3342 ± 100 K. We estimate its stellar rotation period to be 75 ± 5 d based on archival long-term photometry. We confirm and characterize the planet based on a series of ground-based multiwavelength photometry, high-angular-resolution imaging observations, and precise radial velocities from Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)/SpectroPolarimètre InfraROUge (SPIRou). Our joint analysis reveals that the planet has a radius of 2.20 ± 0.17 R<SUB>⊕</SUB> and a mass of 6.4 ± 2.4 M<SUB>⊕</SUB>. The mass and radius of TOI-2136 b are consistent with a broad range of compositions, from water-ice to gas-dominated worlds. TOI-2136 b falls close to the radius valley for M dwarfs predicted by thermally driven atmospheric mass-loss models, making it an interesting target for future studies of its interior structure and atmospheric properties.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.4120G
Starfall: a heavy rain of stars in 'turning on' AGN;;As active galactic nuclei (AGN) 'turn on', some stars end up embedded in accretion discs around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on retrograde orbits. Such stars experience strong headwinds, aerodynamic drag, ablation, and orbital evolution on short time-scales. The loss of orbital angular momentum in the first ~0.1 Myr of an AGN leads to a heavy rain of stars ('starfall') into the inner disc and on to the SMBH. A large AGN loss cone (θ<SUB>AGN, lc</SUB>) can result from binary scatterings in the inner disc and yield tidal disruption events (TDEs). Signatures of starfall include optical/UV flares that rise in luminosity over time, particularly in the inner disc. If the SMBH mass is $M_{\rm SMBH} rsim 10^{8}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$, flares truncate abruptly and the star is swallowed. If $M_{\rm SMBH} 10^{8}\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$, and if the infalling orbit lies within θ<SUB>AGN, lc</SUB>, the flare is followed by a TDE that can be prograde or retrograde relative to the AGN inner disc. Retrograde AGN TDEs are overluminous and short-lived as in-plane ejecta collide with the inner disc and a lower AGN state follows. Prograde AGN TDEs add angular momentum to inner disc gas and so start off looking like regular TDEs but are followed by an AGN high state. Searches for such flare signatures test models of AGN 'turn on', SMBH mass, as well as disc properties and the embedded population.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.4102M
Observations of the very young Type Ia Supernova 2019np with early-excess emission;;Early-time radiative signals from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) can provide important constraints on the explosion mechanism and the progenitor system. We present observations and analysis of SN 2019np, a nearby SN Ia discovered within 1-2 days after the explosion. Follow-up observations were conducted in optical, ultraviolet, and near-infrared bands, covering the phases from ~-16.7 d to ~+ 367.8 d relative to its B-band peak luminosity. The photometric and spectral evolutions of SN 2019np resemble the average behaviour of normal SNe Ia. The absolute B-band peak magnitude and the post-peak decline rate are M<SUB>max</SUB>(B) = -19.52 ± 0.47 mag and Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(B) = 1.04 ± 0.04 mag, respectively. No Hydrogen line has been detected in the nebular-phase spectra of SN 2019np. Assuming that the <SUP>56</SUP>Ni powering the light curve is centrally located, we find that the bolometric light curve of SN 2019np shows a flux excess up to 5.0 per cent in the early phase compared to the radiative diffusion model. Such an extra radiation perhaps suggests the presence of an additional energy source beyond the radioactive decay of central nickel. Comparing the observed colour evolution with that predicted by different models, such as interactions of SN ejecta with circumstellar matter (CSM)/companion star, a double-detonation explosion from a sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf (WD) and surface <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mixing, we propose that the nickel mixing is more favoured for SN 2019np.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.3541S
Coordinated time variability of multi-phase ultra-fast outflows in J132216.25 + 052446.3;;We present a time variability analysis of broad absorption lines (BAL; spread over the velocity range of 5800-29 000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) seen in the spectrum of J132216.25 + 052446.3 (z<SUB>em</SUB> = 2.04806) at ten different epochs spanning over 19 yr. The strongest absorption component (BAL-A; spread over 5800-9900 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) is made up of several narrow components having velocity separations close to C IV doublet splitting. The C IV, N V, and Si IV absorption from BAL-A show correlated optical depth variability without major changes in the velocity structure. A very broad and shallow absorption (BAL-C; spread over the velocity range 15 000-29 000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) emerged during our monitoring period coinciding with a dimming episode of J1322 + 0524. All the identified absorption lines show correlated variability with the equivalent widths increasing with decreasing flux. This together with the C IV emission line variability is consistent with ionization being the main driver of the correlated variability. The observed UV-continuum variations are weaker than what is required by the photoionization models. This together with a scatter in the C IV equivalent width at a given continuum flux can be understood if variations of the C IV ionizing photons are much larger than that of the UV continuum, the variations in the ionizing photon and UV fluxes are not correlated and/or the covering factor of the flow varies continuously. We suggest BAL-A is produced by a stable clumpy outflow located beyond the broad emission line region and BAL-C is a newly formed wind component located near the accretion disc and both respond to changes in the ionizing continuum.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.1975A
ASTRI Mini-Array core science at the Observatorio del Teide;;The ASTRI (Astrofisica con Specchi a Tecnologia Replicante Italiana) Project led by the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) is developing and will deploy at the Observatorio del Teide a mini-array (ASTRI Mini-Array) composed of nine telescopes similar to the small-size dual-mirror Schwarzschild-Couder telescope (ASTRI-Horn) currently operating on the slopes of Mt. Etna in Sicily. The ASTRI Mini-Array will surpass the current Cherenkov telescope array differential sensitivity above a few tera-electronvolt (TeV), extending the energy band well above hundreds of TeV. This will allow us to explore a new window of the electromagnetic spectrum, by convolving the sensitivity performance with excellent angular and energy resolution figures. In this paper we describe the Core Science that we will address during the first four years of operation, providing examples of the breakthrough results that we will obtain when dealing with current open questions, such as the acceleration of cosmic rays, cosmology and fundamental physics and the new window, for the TeV energy band, of the time-domain astrophysics.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JHEAp..35....1V
Machine learning applied to asteroid dynamics;;Machine learning (ML) is the branch of computer science that studies computer algorithms that can learn from data. It is mainly divided into supervised learning, where the computer is presented with examples of entries, and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs, and unsupervised learning, where no label is provided to the learning algorithm, leaving it alone to find structures. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning based on numerous layers of artificial neural networks, which are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. In asteroid dynamics, machine learning methods have been recently used to identify members of asteroid families, small bodies images in astronomical fields, and to identify resonant arguments images of asteroids in three-body resonances, among other applications. Here, we will conduct a full review of available literature in the field and classify it in terms of metrics recently used by other authors to assess the state of the art of applications of machine learning in other astronomical subfields. For comparison, applications of machine learning to Solar System bodies, a larger area that includes imaging and spectrophotometry of small bodies, have already reached a state classified as progressing. Research communities and methodologies are more established, and the use of ML led to the discovery of new celestial objects or features, or new insights in the area. ML applied to asteroid dynamics, however, is still in the emerging phase, with smaller groups, methodologies still not well-established, and fewer papers producing discoveries or insights. Large observational surveys, like those conducted at the Zwicky Transient Facility or at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, will produce in the next years very substantial datasets of orbital and physical properties for asteroids. Applications of ML for clustering, image identification, and anomaly detection, among others, are currently being developed and are expected of being of great help in the next few years.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022CeMDA.134...36C
Magnetar Engines in Fast Blue Optical Transients and Their Connections with SLSNe, SNe Ic-BL, and lGRBs;;We fit the multiband lightcurves of 40 fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) with the magnetar engine model. The mass of the FBOT ejecta, the initial spin period, and the polar magnetic field of the FBOT magnetars are respectively constrained to ${M}_{\mathrm{ej}}={0.11}_{-0.09}^{+0.22}\,{M}_{\odot }$ , ${P}_{{\rm{i}}}={9.1}_{-4.4}^{+9.3}\,\mathrm{ms}$ , and ${B}_{{\rm{p}}}={11}_{-7}^{+18}\times {10}^{14}\,{\rm{G}}$ . The wide distribution of the value of B <SUB>p</SUB> spreads the parameter ranges of the magnetars from superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) to broad-line Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic-BL; some are observed to be associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts), which are also suggested to be driven by magnetars. Combining FBOTs with the other transients, we find a strong universal anticorrelation of ${P}_{{\rm{i}}}\propto {M}_{\mathrm{ej}}^{-0.41}$ , indicating they could share a common origin. To be specific, it is suspected that all of these transients originate from the collapse of extremely stripped stars in close binary systems, but with different progenitor masses. As a result, FBOTs distinguish themselves by their small ejecta masses with an upper limit of ~1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, which leads to an observational separation in the rise time of the lightcurves of ~10 days. In addition, FBOTs together with SLSNe can be separated from SNe Ic-BL by an empirical line in the M <SUB>peak</SUB>-t <SUB>rise</SUB> plane corresponding to an energy requirement of the mass of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni of ~0.3M <SUB>ej</SUB>, where M <SUB>peak</SUB> is the peak absolute magnitude of the transients and t <SUB>rise</SUB> is the rise time.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935L..34L
Discovery of the First Known Asteroid Confined within the Orbit of Venus;;We report on the discovery by the Zwicky Transient Facility of an asteroid orbiting entirely within the orbit of Venus, the first known example of this orbital class. The asteroid's perihelion is closer to the Sun than the aphelion of Mercury, and its diameter is estimated at about 1.8 km assuming an albedo of 0.2. The object was first observed on 2020 January 4 in four exposures obtained 7 minutes apart during an evening twilight survey. Its IAU-recognized designation is 594913 'Ayló'chaxnim.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935L...6I
Luminous Optical and X-Ray Flaring of the Putative Redback Millisecond Pulsar 1FGL J0523.5-2529;;Several redback and black widow millisecond pulsar binaries have episodes of flaring in X-rays and optical. We initially detected such behavior from the Fermi selected redback candidate 1FGL J0523.5-2529 during optical time-series monitoring. Triggered observations with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory over the next ≈100 days showed episodic flaring in X-rays with luminosity up to 8 × 10<SUP>33</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> (~100 times the minimum), and a comparable luminosity in the optical/UV, with similar power-law spectra of f <SUB> ν </SUB> ∝ ν <SUP>-0.7</SUP>. These are the most luminous flares seen in any nonaccreting "spider" pulsar system, which may be related to the large size of the companion through the fraction of the pulsar wind that it or its ablated wind intercepts. Simultaneously with an optical flare, we see Balmer line and He I emission, not previously known in this object, which is evidence of a stellar wind that may also inhibit detection of radio pulsations. The quiescent optical light curves, while dominated by ellipsoidal modulation, show evidence of variable nonuniform temperature that could be due either to large starspots or asymmetric heating of the companion by the pulsar. This may explain a previous measurement of unusual nonzero orbital eccentricity as, alternatively, distortion of the radial-velocity curve by the surface temperature distribution of the large companion.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935..151H
Observing Scenarios for the Next Decade of Early Warning Detection of Binary Neutron Stars;;We describe representative observing scenarios for early warning detection of binary neutron star mergers with the current generation of ground-based gravitational wave detectors as they approach design sensitivity. We incorporate recent estimates of the infrastructure latency and detector sensitivities to provide up-to-date predictions. We use Fisher analysis to approximate the associated localizations, and we directly compare to Bayestar to quantify biases inherited from this approach. In particular, we show that Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo will detect and distribute ≲1 signal with signal-to-noise ratio greater than 15 before a merger in their fourth observing run provided they maintain a 70% duty cycle. This is consistent with previous early warning detection estimates. We estimate that 60% of all observations and 8% of those detectable 20 s before a merger will be localized to ≲100 deg<SUP>2</SUP>. If KAGRA is able to achieve a 25 Mpc horizon, 70% of these binary neutron stars will be localized to ≲100 deg<SUP>2</SUP> by a merger. As the Aundha-Hanford-KAGRA-Livingston-Virgo network approaches design sensitivity over the next ~10 yr, we expect one (six) early warning alerts to be distributed 60 (0) s before a merger. Although adding detectors to the Hanford-Livingston-Virgo network at design sensitivity impacts the detection rate at ≲50% level, it significantly improves localization prospects. Given uncertainties in sensitivities, participating detectors, and duty cycles, we consider 103 future detector configurations so electromagnetic observers can tailor preparations toward their preferred models.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935..139M
Foraging with MUSHROOMS: A Mixed-integer Linear Programming Scheduler for Multimessenger Target of Opportunity Searches with the Zwicky Transient Facility;;Electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational-wave detections is very resource intensive, taking up hours of limited observation time on dozens of telescopes. Creating more efficient schedules for follow-up will lead to a commensurate increase in counterpart location efficiency without using more telescope time. Widely used in operations research and telescope scheduling, mixed-integer linear programming is a strong candidate to produce these higher-efficiency schedules, as it can make use of powerful commercial solvers that find globally optimal solutions to provided problems. We detail a new target-of-opportunity scheduling algorithm designed with Zwicky Transient Facility in mind that uses mixed-integer linear programming. We compare its performance to gwemopt, the tuned heuristic scheduler used by the Zwicky Transient Facility and other facilities during the third LIGO-Virgo gravitational-wave observing run. This new algorithm uses variable-length observing blocks to enforce cadence requirements and to ensure field observability, along with having a secondary optimization step to minimize slew time. We show that by employing a hybrid method utilizing both this scheduler and gwemopt, the previous scheduler used, in concert, we can achieve an average improvement in detection efficiency of 3%-11% over gwemopt alone for a simulated binary neutron star merger data set consistent with LIGO-Virgo's third observing run, highlighting the potential of mixed-integer target of opportunity schedulers for future multimessenger follow-up surveys.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935...87P
Evolution of X-Ray Activity in <25 Myr Old Pre-main Sequence Stars;;Measuring the evolution of X-ray emission from pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars gives insight into two issues: the response of magnetic dynamo processes to changes in the interior structure, and the effects of high-energy radiation on protoplanetary disks and primordial planetary atmospheres. We present a sample of 6003 stars with ages 7-25 Myr in 10 nearby open clusters from Chandra X-ray and Gaia-EDR3 surveys. Combined with previous results in large samples of younger (≲5 Myr) stars in MYStIX and SFiNCs star-forming regions, mass-stratified activity-age relations are derived for the early phases of stellar evolution. X-ray luminosity (L <SUB> X </SUB>) is constant during the first few Myr, possibly due to the presence of extended X-ray coronas insensitive to temporal changes in stellar size. L <SUB> X </SUB> then decays during the 7-25 Myr period, more rapidly as stellar mass increases. This decay is interpreted as decreasing efficiency of the α <SUP>2</SUP> dynamo as radiative cores grow and a solar-type αΩ dynamo emerges. For more massive 3.5-7 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> fully radiative stars, the X-ray emission plummets-indicating the lack of an effective magnetic dynamo. The findings provide improved measurements of high-energy radiation effects on circumstellar material, first for the protoplanetary disk and then for the atmospheres of young planets. The observed X-ray luminosities can be so high that an inner Earth-mass rocky, unmagnetized planet around a solar-mass PMS star might lose its primary and secondary atmospheres within a few (several) million years. PMS X-ray emission may thus have a significant impact on the evolution of early-planetary atmospheres and the conditions promoting the rise of habitability.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935...43G
SRGA J181414.6-225604: A New Galactic Symbiotic X-Ray Binary Outburst Triggered by an Intense Mass-loss Episode of a Heavily Obscured Mira Variable;;We present the discovery and multiwavelength characterization of SRGA J181414.6-225604, a Galactic hard X-ray transient discovered during the ongoing SRG/ART-XC sky survey. Using data from the Palomar Gattini-IR survey, we identify a spatially and temporally coincident variable infrared (IR) source, IRAS 18111-2257, and classify it as a very-late-type (M7-M8), long-period (1502 ± 24 days), and luminous (M <SUB> K </SUB> ≈ -9.9 ± 0.2) O-rich Mira donor star located at a distance of ≈14.6<SUP>+2.9</SUP> <SUB>-2.3</SUB> kpc. Combining multicolor photometric data over the last ≈25 yr, we show that the IR counterpart underwent a recent (starting ≈800 days before the X-ray flare) enhanced mass-loss (reaching ≈2.1 × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) episode, resulting in an expanding dust shell obscuring the underlying star. Multi-epoch follow-up observations from Swift, NICER, and NuSTAR reveal a ≈200 day long X-ray outburst reaching a peak luminosity of L <SUB>X</SUB> ≈ 2.5 × 10<SUP>36</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, characterized by a heavily absorbed (N <SUB>H</SUB> ≈ 6 × 10<SUP>22</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) X-ray spectrum consistent with an optically thick Comptonized plasma. The X-ray spectral and timing behavior suggest the presence of clumpy wind accretion, together with a dense ionized nebula overabundant in silicate material surrounding the compact object. Together, we show that SRGA J181414.6-225604 is a new symbiotic X-ray binary in outburst, triggered by an intense dust-formation episode of a highly evolved donor. Our results offer the first direct confirmation for the speculated connection between enhanced late-stage donor mass loss and the active lifetimes of symbiotic X-ray binaries.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935...36D
Weak Mass Loss from the Red Supergiant Progenitor of the Type II SN 2021yja;;We present high-cadence optical, ultraviolet (UV), and near-infrared data of the nearby (D ≈ 23 Mpc) Type II supernova (SN) 2021yja. Many Type II SNe show signs of interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) during the first few days after explosion, implying that their red supergiant (RSG) progenitors experience episodic or eruptive mass loss. However, because it is difficult to discover SNe early, the diversity of CSM configurations in RSGs has not been fully mapped. SN 2021yja, first detected within ≈ 5.4 hours of explosion, shows some signatures of CSM interaction (high UV luminosity and radio and x-ray emission) but without the narrow emission lines or early light-curve peak that can accompany CSM. Here we analyze the densely sampled early light curve and spectral series of this nearby SN to infer the properties of its progenitor and CSM. We find that the most likely progenitor was an RSG with an extended envelope, encompassed by low-density CSM. We also present archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the host galaxy of SN 2021yja, which allows us to place a stringent upper limit of ≲ 9 M <SUB>☉</SUB> on the progenitor mass. However, this is in tension with some aspects of the SN evolution, which point to a more massive progenitor. Our analysis highlights the need to consider progenitor structure when making inferences about CSM properties, and that a comprehensive view of CSM tracers should be made to give a fuller view of the last years of RSG evolution.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935...31H
Improving Astronomical Time-series Classification via Data Augmentation with Generative Adversarial Networks;;Due to the latest advances in technology, telescopes with significant sky coverage will produce millions of astronomical alerts per night that must be classified both rapidly and automatically. Currently, classification consists of supervised machine-learning algorithms whose performance is limited by the number of existing annotations of astronomical objects and their highly imbalanced class distributions. In this work, we propose a data augmentation methodology based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate a variety of synthetic light curves from variable stars. Our novel contributions, consisting of a resampling technique and an evaluation metric, can assess the quality of generative models in unbalanced data sets and identify GAN-overfitting cases that the Fréchet inception distance does not reveal. We applied our proposed model to two data sets taken from the Catalina and Zwicky Transient Facility surveys. The classification accuracy of variable stars is improved significantly when training with synthetic data and testing with real data with respect to the case of using only real data.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935...23G
COol Companions ON Ultrawide orbiTS (COCONUTS). III. A Very Red L6 Benchmark Brown Dwarf around a Young M5 Dwarf;;We present the third discovery from the COol Companions ON Ultrawide orbiTS (COCONUTS) program, the COCONUTS-3 system, composed of the young M5 primary star UCAC4 374-046899 and the very red L6 dwarf WISEA J081322.19-152203.2. These two objects have a projected separation of $61^{\prime\prime} $ (1891 au) and are physically associated given their common proper motions and estimated distances. The primary star, COCONUTS-3A, has a mass of 0.123 ± 0.006 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, and we estimate its age as 100 Myr to 1 Gyr based on its stellar activity (via Hα and X-ray emission), kinematics, and spectrophotometric properties. We derive its bulk metallicity as 0.21 ± 0.07 dex using empirical calibrations established by older and higher-gravity M dwarfs and find that this [Fe/H] could be slightly underestimated according to PHOENIX models given COCONUTS-3A's younger age. The companion, COCONUTS-3B, has a near-infrared spectral type of L6 ± 1 INT-G, and we infer physical properties of T <SUB>eff</SUB> = ${1362}_{-73}^{+48}$ K, $\mathrm{log}(g)$ = ${4.96}_{-0.34}^{+0.15}$ dex, $R\,=\,{1.03}_{-0.06}^{+0.12}$ R <SUB>Jup</SUB>, and $M\,=\,{39}_{-18}^{+11}$ M <SUB>Jup</SUB> using its bolometric luminosity, its host star's age, and hot-start evolution models. We construct cloudy atmospheric model spectra at the evolution-based physical parameters and compare them to COCONUTS-3B's spectrophotometry. We find that this companion possesses ample condensate clouds in its photosphere (f <SUB>sed</SUB> = 1) with the data-model discrepancies likely due to the models using an older version of the opacity database. Compared to field-age L6 dwarfs, COCONUTS-3B has fainter absolute magnitudes and a 120 K cooler T <SUB>eff</SUB>. Also, the J - K color of this companion is among the reddest for ultracool benchmarks with ages older than a few hundred megayears. COCONUTS-3 likely formed in the same fashion as stellar binaries given the companion-to-host mass ratio of 0.3 and represents a valuable benchmark to quantify the systematics of substellar model atmospheres.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...935...15Z
A Uniform Type Ia Supernova Distance Ladder with the Zwicky Transient Facility: Absolute Calibration Based on the Tip of the Red Giant Branch Method;;The current Cepheid-calibrated distance ladder measurement of H <SUB>0</SUB> is reported to be in tension with the values inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), assuming standard cosmology. However, some tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) estimates report H <SUB>0</SUB> in better agreement with the CMB. Hence, it is critical to reduce systematic uncertainties in local measurements to understand the Hubble tension. In this paper, we propose a uniform distance ladder between the second and third rungs, combining Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) with a TRGB calibration of their absolute luminosity. A large, volume-limited sample of both calibrator and Hubble flow SNe Ia from the same survey minimizes two of the largest sources of systematics: host-galaxy bias and nonuniform photometric calibration. We present results from a pilot study using the existing TRGB distance to the host galaxy of ZTF SN Ia SN 2021rhu (aka ZTF21abiuvdk) in NGC7814. Combining the ZTF calibrator with a volume-limited sample from the first data release of ZTF Hubble flow SNe Ia, we infer H <SUB>0</SUB> = 76.94 ± 6.4 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-1</SUP>, an 8.3% measurement. The error budget is dominated by the single object calibrating the SN Ia luminosity in this pilot study. However, the ZTF sample includes already five other SNe Ia within ~20 Mpc for which TRGB distances can be obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. Finally, we present the prospects of building this distance ladder out to 80 Mpc with James Webb Space Telescope observations of more than 100 ZTF SNe Ia.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...934..185D
1RXH J082623.6-505741: A New Long-period Cataclysmic Variable with an Evolved Donor and a Low Mass-transfer Rate;;We report the discovery of 1RXH J082623.6-505741, a 10.4 hr orbital period compact binary. Modeling extensive optical photometry and spectroscopy reveals a ~0.4 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> K-type secondary transferring mass through a low-state accretion disk to a nonmagnetic ~0.8 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> white dwarf. The secondary is overluminous for its mass and dominates the optical spectra at all epochs and must be evolved to fill its Roche Lobe at this orbital period. The X-ray luminosity L <SUB> X </SUB> ~ 1-2 × 10<SUP>32</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> derived from both new XMM-Newton and archival observations, although high compared to most CVs, still only requires a modest accretion rate onto the white dwarf of $\dot{M}$ ~ 3 × 10<SUP>-11</SUP> to 3 × 10<SUP>-10</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, lower than expected for a cataclysmic variable with an evolved secondary. No dwarf nova outbursts have yet been observed from the system, consistent with the low derived mass-transfer rate. Several other cataclysmic variables with similar orbital periods also show unexpectedly low mass-transfer rates, even though selection effects disfavor the discovery of binaries with these properties. This suggests the abundance and evolutionary state of long-period, low mass-transfer rate cataclysmic variables are worthy of additional attention.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...934..142S
The X-Ray and Radio Loud Fast Blue Optical Transient AT2020mrf: Implications for an Emerging Class of Engine-driven Massive Star Explosions;;We present AT2020mrf (SRGe J154754.2+443907), an extra-galactic (z = 0.1353) fast blue optical transient (FBOT) with a rise time of t <SUB> g,rise</SUB> = 3.7 days and a peak luminosity of M <SUB> g,peak</SUB> = -20.0. Its optical spectrum around peak shows a broad (v ~ 0.1c) emission feature on a blue continuum (T ~ 2 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> K), which bears a striking resemblance to AT2018cow. Its bright radio emission (ν L <SUB> ν </SUB> = 1.2 × 10<SUP>39</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>; ν <SUB>rest</SUB> = 7.4 GHz; 261 days) is similar to four other AT2018cow-like events, and can be explained by synchrotron radiation from the interaction between a sub-relativistic (≳0.07-0.08c) forward shock and a dense environment ( $\dot{M}\lesssim {10}^{-3}\,{M}_{\odot }\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$ for v <SUB>w</SUB> = 10<SUP>3</SUP> km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). AT2020mrf occurs in a galaxy with M <SUB>*</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>8</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> and specific star formation rate ~10<SUP>-10</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, supporting the idea that AT2018cow-like events are preferentially hosted by dwarf galaxies. The X-ray luminosity of AT2020mrf is the highest among FBOTs. At 35-37 days, SRG/eROSITA detected luminous (L <SUB>X</SUB> ~ 2 × 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>; 0.3-10 keV) X-ray emission. The X-ray spectral shape (f <SUB> ν </SUB> ∝ ν <SUP>-0.8</SUP>) and erratic intraday variability are reminiscent of AT2018cow, but the luminosity is a factor of ~20 greater than AT2018cow. At 328 days, Chandra detected it at L <SUB>X</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is >200 times more luminous than AT2018cow and CSS161010. At the same time, the X-ray emission remains variable on the timescale of ~1 day. We show that a central engine, probably a millisecond magnetar or an accreting black hole, is required to power the explosion. We predict the rates at which events like AT2018cow and AT2020mrf will be detected by SRG and Einstein Probe.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...934..104Y
The Nature of Luminous Quasars with Very Large C IV Equivalent Widths;;We report results for a complete sample of 10 luminous radio-quiet quasars with large C IV equivalent widths (EW ≥ 150 Å). For 8/10 we performed Chandra snapshot observations. We find that, in addition to the enhanced C IV line EW, their He II and Mg II lines are enhanced, but the C III] line is not. Their X-ray emission is substantially stronger than expected from their ultraviolet luminosity. Additionally, these large C IV EW quasars show small C IV blueshifts and possibly low Eddington ratios, suggesting that they are "extreme low Eigenvector 1 (EV1)" quasars. The mean excess He II EW is well matched by radiation pressure compression (RPC) photoionization models, with the harder α <SUB>ox</SUB> ionizing spectrum. However, these results do not reproduce well the enhancement pattern of the C IV, Mg II, and C III] EWs, or the observed high C IV/Mg II ratio. RPC calculations indicate that the C IV/Mg II line ratio is an effective metallicity indicator, and models with subsolar-metallicity gas and a hard ionizing continuum reproduce well the enhancement pattern of all four ultraviolet lines. We find that the C IV/Mg II line ratio in quasars is generally correlated with the excess X-ray emission. Extremely high EV1 quasars are characterized by high metallicity and suppressed X-ray emission. The underlying mechanism relating gas metallicity and X-ray emission is not clear but may be related to radiation-pressure-driven disk winds, which are enhanced at high metallicity, and consequent mass loading reducing coronal X-ray emission.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...934...97F
Traversable wormholes with charge and non-commutative geometry in the f(Q) gravity;;We consider modified symmetric teleparallel gravity (STG), in which gravitational Lagrangian is given by the arbitrary function of non-metricity scalar Q to study static and spherically symmetric charged traversable wormhole solutions with non-commutative background geometry. The matter source at the wormhole throat is acknowledged to be anisotropic, and the redshift function has a constant value (thus, our wormhole solution is non-tidal). We study the obtained field equations with the two functional forms of f(Q) STG models, such as linear f(Q) = αQ + β and non-linear f(Q) = Q + mQ<SUP>n</SUP> models under Gaussian and Lorentzian distributions. Our analysis found the exact wormhole solutions for the linear STG model only. Also, for the non-linear model, we derived numerically suitable forms of wormhole shape functions directly from the modified Einstein Field Equations (EFEs). Besides, we probed these models via Null, Dominant, and Strong energy conditions with respect to free Modified gravity (MOG) parameters α, β, m, and n. We also used Tolman-Oppenheimer-Vokloff (TOV) equation to investigate the stability of wormhole anisotropic matter in considered MOG. Finally, we plot the equation of state.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AnPhy.44368968S
Asteroseismology Across the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram;;Asteroseismology has grown from its beginnings three decades ago to a mature field teeming with discoveries and applications. This phenomenal growth has been enabled by space photometry with precision 10-100 times better than ground-based observations, with nearly continuous light curves for durations of weeks to years, and by large-scale ground-based surveys spanning years designed to detect all time-variable phenomena. The new high-precision data are full of surprises, deepening our understanding of the physics of stars. This review explores asteroseismic developments from the past decade primarily as a result of light curves from the Kepler and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite space missions for massive upper main sequence OBAF stars, pre-main-sequence stars, peculiar stars, classical pulsators, white dwarfs and subdwarfs, and tidally interacting close binaries. The space missions have increased the numbers of pulsators in many classes by an order of magnitude. Asteroseismology measures fundamental stellar parameters and stellar interior physics-mass, radius, age, metallicity, luminosity, distance, magnetic fields, interior rotation, angular momentum transfer, convective overshoot, core-burning stage-supporting disparate fields such as galactic archeology, exoplanet host stars, supernovae progenitors, gamma-ray and gravitational wave precursors, close binary star origins and evolution, and standard candles. Stars are the luminous tracers of the Universe. Asteroseismology significantly improves models of stellar structure and evolution on which all inference from stars depends.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ARA&A..60...31K
The Astronomy Commons Platform: A Deployable Cloud-based Analysis Platform for Astronomy;;We present a scalable, cloud-based science platform solution designed to enable next-to-the-data analyses of terabyte-scale astronomical tabular data sets. The presented platform is built on Amazon Web Services (over Kubernetes and S3 abstraction layers), utilizes Apache Spark and the Astronomy eXtensions for Spark for parallel data analysis and manipulation, and provides the familiar JupyterHub web-accessible front end for user access. We outline the architecture of the analysis platform, provide implementation details and rationale for (and against) technology choices, verify scalability through strong and weak scaling tests, and demonstrate usability through an example science analysis of data from the Zwicky Transient Facility's 1Bn+ light-curve catalog. Furthermore, we show how this system enables an end user to iteratively build analyses (in Python) that transparently scale processing with no need for end-user interaction. The system is designed to be deployable by astronomers with moderate cloud engineering knowledge, or (ideally) IT groups. Over the past 3 yr, it has been utilized to build science platforms for the DiRAC Institute, the ZTF partnership, the LSST Solar System Science Collaboration, and the LSST Interdisciplinary Network for Collaboration and Computing, as well as for numerous short-term events (with over 100 simultaneous users). In a live demo instance, the deployment scripts, source code, and cost calculators are accessible. <SUP>4</SUP> <SUP>4</SUP> http://hub.astronomycommons.org/;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164...68S
TOI-3714 b and TOI-3629 b: Two Gas Giants Transiting M Dwarfs Confirmed with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder and NEID;;We confirm the planetary nature of two gas giants discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to transit M dwarfs. TOI-3714 (V = 15.24, J = 11.74) is an M2 dwarf hosting a hot Jupiter (M <SUB> p </SUB> = 0.70 ± 0.03 M <SUB> J </SUB> and R <SUB> p </SUB> = 1.01 ± 0.03 R <SUB> J </SUB>) on an orbital period of 2.154849 ± 0.000001 days with a resolved white dwarf companion. TOI-3629 (V = 14.63, J = 11.42) is an M1 dwarf hosting a hot Jupiter (M <SUB> p </SUB> = 0.26 ± 0.02 M <SUB> J </SUB> and R <SUB> p </SUB> =0.74 ± 0.02 R <SUB> J </SUB>) on an orbital period of ${3.936551}_{-0.000006}^{+0.000005}$ days. We characterize each transiting companion using a combination of ground-based and space-based photometry, speckle imaging, and high-precision velocimetry from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder and the NEID spectrographs. With the discovery of these two systems, there are now nine M dwarfs known to host transiting hot Jupiters. Among this population, TOI-3714 b (T <SUB>eq</SUB> = 750 ± 20 K and TSM = 98 ± 7) and TOI-3629 b (T <SUB>eq</SUB> = 690 ± 20 K and TSM = 80 ± 9) are warm gas giants amenable to additional characterization with transmission spectroscopy to probe atmospheric chemistry and, for TOI-3714, obliquity measurements to probe formation scenarios.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164...50C
Evaluating the V-band Photometric Metallicity with Fundamental Mode RR Lyrae in the Kepler Field;;The aim of this work is to evaluate the performance of photometric metallicity [Fe/H], determined based on V-band light curves photometrically transformed from the gr-band light curves. We tested this by using a set of homogeneous samples of fundamental mode RR Lyrae located in the Kepler field. It was found that the color term is necessary in such photometric transformation. We demonstrated that when including the color term the determined photometric [Fe/H] are in good agreement with the spectroscopic [Fe/H], either based on the calibrated or the transformed V-band light curves. We also tested the impact of Blazhko RR Lyrae in determining the photometric [Fe/H], and found that Blazhko RR Lyrae can give consistent photometric [Fe/H]. Finally, we derived independent gVr-band [Fe/H]-ϕ <SUB>31</SUB>-P relations (where ϕ <SUB>31</SUB> and P are the Fourier parameter and pulsation period, respectively) using our light curves. The V-band relation is in good agreement with the most recent determination given in the literature.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164...45N
TUVO-21acq: A new cataclysmic variable discovered through a UV outburst;;Outbursts from cataclysmic variables, such as dwarf novae (DNe), are prevalent throughout the galaxy and are known to emit strongly in the ultraviolet (UV). However, the UV emission of DN outbursts has not been studied extensively compared with the optical. Detailed characterisation of the physical processes responsible for outburst behaviour requires further UV data, because the UV probes the inner regions of the accretion disc. Here we report, as part of our recently launched Transient UV Objects (TUVO) project, the discovery of TUVO-21acq, a new transient which we detected in the UV using data from the Ultraviolet Optical Telescope (UVOT) aboard Swift. We detected two separate outbursts and used the UVOT data to constrain source properties, focusing on the amplitudes and timescales of the outbursts. We found that during the first outburst the source increased in brightness by at least 4.1, 2.4, and 3.5 mag and during the second outburst by 4.4, 3.4, and 3.6 mag in the UVW1, UVM2, and UVW2 bands, respectively. The outburst durations were in the range of 6-21 days and 11-46 days, and we determined an upper limit for the recurrence time of 316 days. To further characterise the source, we obtained an optical spectrum during quiescence with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). The spectrum exhibited hydrogen Balmer series and helium emission lines, and a flat overall spectral shape. We confirm the nature of the source as an accreting white dwarf which underwent DN outburst based on photometric and spectroscopic properties. This study serves as a proof of concept for the TUVO project strategy, demonstrating that it has the capability of discovering and classifying new, interesting UV transients. We also discuss the implications of our findings for our understanding of the physics underlying DN outbursts, in particular with respect to the UV emission. We examine the need for simultaneous UV and optical observations during the onset of DN outbursts in order to help answer remaining questions as to the characteristics and implications of the UV delay, for example.

Energetic nuclear transients in luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies;;Energetic nuclear outbursts have been discovered in luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs) at unexpectedly high rates. To investigate this population of transients, we performed a search in mid-IR data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite and its NEOWISE survey to detect and characterise luminous and smoothly evolving transients in a sample of 215 U/LIRGs. We report three new transients, all with ΔL > 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>−1</SUP>, in addition to two previously known cases. Their host galaxies are all part of major galaxy mergers, and through radiative transfer model fitting we find that all have a significant contribution from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We characterised the transients through measurements of their luminosities and resulting energetics, all of which are between 10<SUP>50.9</SUP> erg and 10<SUP>52.2</SUP> erg. The IR emission of the five transients was found to be consistent with re-radiation by the hot dust of emission at shorter wavelengths, presumably originating from an accretion event, onto the supermassive black hole. The corresponding transient rate of (1.6-4.6) × 10<SUP>−3</SUP> yr<SUP>−1</SUP> galaxy<SUP>−1</SUP> is over an order of magnitude higher than the rate of large amplitude flares shown by AGN in the optical. We suggest that the observed transients are part of a dust-obscured population of tidal disruption events (TDEs) that have remained out of the reach of optical surveys due to the obscuring dust. In one case, this is supported by our radio observations. We also discuss other plausible explanations. The observed rate of events is significantly higher than optical TDE rates, which can be expected in U/LIRG hosts undergoing a major galaxy merger with increased stellar densities in the nuclear regions. Continued searches for such transients and their multi-wavelength follow-up is required to constrain their rate and nature.

Milky Way archaeology using RR Lyrae and type II Cepheids. II. High-velocity RR Lyrae stars and Milky Way mass;;We report the discovery of high-velocity candidates among RR Lyrae stars found in the Milky Way halo. We identified nine RR Lyrae stars with Galactocentric velocities exceeding the local escape velocity based on the assumed Galaxy potential. Furthermore, based on a close examination of their orbits', we ruled out their ejection location in the Milky Way disk and bulge. The spatial distribution revealed that seven out of nine pulsators overlap with the position of the Sagittarius stellar stream. Two out of these seven RR Lyrae stars can be tentatively linked to the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy on the basis of their orbits. Focusing on the high-velocity tail of the RR Lyrae velocity distribution, we estimated the escape velocity in the Solar neighborhood to be v<SUB>esc</SUB> = 512<SUB>−37</SUB><SUP>+94</SUP> km s<SUP>−1</SUP> (4 to 12 kpc); and beyond the Solar neighborhood as v<SUB>esc</SUB> = 436<SUB>−22</SUB><SUP>+44</SUP> km s<SUP>−1</SUP> and v<SUB>esc</SUB> = 393<SUB>−26</SUB><SUP>+53</SUP> km s<SUP>−1</SUP> (for distances between 12 to 20 kpc and 20 to 28 kpc), respectively. We utilized three escape velocity estimates together with the local circular velocity to estimate the Milky Way mass. The resulting measurement M<SUB>200</SUB> = 0.83<SUB>−0.16</SUB><SUP>+0.29</SUP> × 10<SUP>12</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> falls on the lower end of the current Milky Way mass estimates, but once corrected for the likely bias in the escape velocity (an increase of approximately 10% in terms of the escape velocity), our mass estimate yields M<SUB>200</SUB> = 1.26<SUB>−0.22</SUB><SUP>+0.40</SUP> × 10<SUP>12</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, which is in agreement with estimates based on different diagnostics of the Milky Way (MW) mass.

The Gaia EDR3 view of Johnson-Kron-Cousins standard stars: the curated Landolt and Stetson collections;;Context. In the era of large surveys and space missions, it is necessary to rely on large samples of well-characterized stars for inter-calibrating and comparing measurements from different surveys and catalogues. Among the most employed photometric systems, the Johnson-Kron-Cousins has been used for decades and for a large amount of important datasets. 
 Aims: Our goal is to profit from the Gaia EDR3 data, Gaia official cross-match algorithm, and Gaia-derived literature catalogues, to provide a well-characterized and clean sample of secondary standards in the Johnson-Kron-Cousins system, as well as a set of transformations between the main photometric systems and the Johnson-Kron-Cousins one. 
 Methods: Using Gaia as a reference, as well as data from reddening maps, spectroscopic surveys, and variable stars monitoring surveys, we curated and characterized the widely used Landolt and Stetson collections of more than 200 000 secondary standards, employing classical as well as machine learning techniques. In particular, our atmospheric parameters agree significantly better with spectroscopic ones, compared to other machine learning catalogues. We also cross-matched the curated collections with the major photometric surveys to provide a comprehensive set of reliable measurements in the most widely adopted photometric systems. 
 Results: We provide a curated catalogue of secondary standards in the Johnson-Kron-Cousins system that are well-measured and as free as possible from variable and multiple sources. We characterize the collection in terms of astrophysical parameters, distance, reddening, and radial velocity. We provide a table with the magnitudes of the secondary standards in the most widely used photometric systems (ugriz, grizy, Gaia, HIPPARCOS, Tycho, 2MASS). We finally provide a set of 167 polynomial transformations, valid for dwarfs and giants, metal-poor and metal-rich stars, to transform UBVRI magnitudes in the above photometric systems and vice-versa.

Multiply eclipsing candidates from the TESS satellite;;We present a catalogue of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) targets that show multiple eclipses. In all of these stars, we detected two sets of eclipses, for which their two distinctive periods can be derived. These multiple stellar systems could either be doubly eclipsing quadruples or triple-star coplanar systems showing eclipses on the outer orbit in addition to the inner eclipses. In total, 116 systems were found to be doubly eclipsing, while 25 stars were identified as triply eclipsing triples. Several confirmed blends of two close sources were not included in our analysis. All these systems were identified by scanning the known eclipsing systems taken from the Variable Star Index database and checking their TESS light curves. The average period of the dominant pair, pair A, is 2.7 days in our sample, while for the second pair, pair B, the average period is 5.3 days. Several systems show evident eclipse timing variation (ETV) changes even from the short interval of the TESS data, indicating possible period changes and short mutual orbit. We also present evidence that the system V0871 Cen is probably a septuple-star system of architecture (Aa-Ab)-B-C-D. Most of the presented systems are adequately bright and show deep enough eclipses for observing, and therefore we call for new ground-based observations for these extremely interesting multiples. Owing to this motivation, we have included also the ephemerides for both pairs of each system, our catalogue also contains their depths of eclipses and the light-curve shapes as extracted from the TESS data. These new ground-based observations would be very useful for further derivation of the mutual movement of both pairs on their orbit via detection of the ETVs of both pairs for example.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...664A..96Z
O'TRAIN: A robust and flexible `real or bogus' classifier for the study of the optical transient sky;;Context. Scientific interest in studying high-energy transient phenomena in the Universe has risen sharply over the last decade. At present, multiple ground-based survey projects have emerged to continuously monitor the optical (and multi-messenger) transient sky at higher image cadences and covering ever larger portions of the sky every night. These novel approaches are leading to a substantial increase in global alert rates, which need to be handled with care, especially with regard to keeping the level of false alarms as low as possible. Therefore, the standard transient detection pipelines previously designed for narrow field-of-view instruments must now integrate more sophisticated tools to deal with the growing number and diversity of alerts and false alarms. 
 Aims: Deep machine learning algorithms have now proven their efficiency in recognising patterns in images. These methods are now used in astrophysics to perform different classification tasks such as identifying bogus from real transient point-like sources. We explore this method to provide a robust and flexible algorithm that could be included in any kind of transient detection pipeline. 
 Methods: We built a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm in order to perform a `real or bogus' classification task on transient candidate cutouts (subtraction residuals) provided by different kinds of optical telescopes. The training involved human-supervised labelling of the cutouts, which are split into two balanced data sets with `true' and `false' point-like source candidates. We tested our CNN model on the candidates produced by two different transient detection pipelines. In addition, we made use of several diagnostic tools to evaluate the classification performance of our CNN models. 
 Results: We show that our CNN algorithm can be successfully trained on a large and diverse array of images on very different pixel scales. In this training process, we did not detect any strong over- or underfitting with the requirement of providing cutouts with a limited size no larger than 50 × 50 pixels. Tested on optical images from four different telescopes and utilising two different transient detection pipelines, our CNN model provides a robust `real or bogus' classification performance accuracy from 93% up to 98% for well-classified candidates.

Quantum gravity phenomenology at the dawn of the multi-messenger era-A review;;The exploration of the universe has recently entered a new era thanks to the multi-messenger paradigm, characterized by a continuous increase in the quantity and quality of experimental data that is obtained by the detection of the various cosmic messengers (photons, neutrinos, cosmic rays and gravitational waves) from numerous origins. They give us information about their sources in the universe and the properties of the intergalactic medium. Moreover, multi-messenger astronomy opens up the possibility to search for phenomenological signatures of quantum gravity. On the one hand, the most energetic events allow us to test our physical theories at energy regimes which are not directly accessible in accelerators; on the other hand, tiny effects in the propagation of very high energy particles could be amplified by cosmological distances. After decades of merely theoretical investigations, the possibility of obtaining phenomenological indications of Planck-scale effects is a revolutionary step in the quest for a quantum theory of gravity, but it requires cooperation between different communities of physicists (both theoretical and experimental). This review, prepared within the COST Action CA18108 "Quantum gravity phenomenology in the multi-messenger approach", is aimed at promoting this cooperation by giving a state-of-the art account of the interdisciplinary expertise that is needed in the effective search of quantum gravity footprints in the production, propagation and detection of cosmic messengers.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PrPNP.12503948A
Strongly lensed type Ia supernovae as a precise late-Universe probe of measuring the Hubble constant and cosmic curvature;;Strongly lensed type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are expected to have some advantages in measuring time delays of multiple images, and so they have a great potential to be developed into a powerful late-Universe cosmological probe. In this paper, we simulate a sample of lensed SNe Ia with time-delay measurements in the era of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Based on the distance sum rule, we use lensed SNe Ia to implement cosmological model-independent constraints on the Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB> and cosmic curvature parameter Ω<SUB>K</SUB> in the late Universe. We find that if 20 lensed SNe Ia could be observed, the constraint on H<SUB>0</SUB> is better than the measurement by the SH0ES Collaboration. When the event number of lensed SNe Ia increases to 100, the constraint precision of H<SUB>0</SUB> is comparable with the result from Planck 2018 data. Considering 200 lensed SNe Ia events as the optimistic estimation, we obtain Δ H<SUB>0</SUB>=0.33 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>−1</SUP> and Δ Ω<SUB>K</SUB>=0.053 . In addition, we also simulate lensed quasars in different scenarios to make a comparison and we find that they are still a useful cosmological probe even though the constraint precision from them is much less than that obtained from lensed SNe Ia. In the era of LSST, the measurements of time delay from both lensed SNe Ia and lensed quasars are expected to yield the results of Δ H<SUB>0</SUB>=0.26 km s<SUP>−1</SUP> Mpc<SUP>−1</SUP> and Δ Ω<SUB>K</SUB>=0.044 .;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PhRvD.106b3520Q
The LCO Outbursting Objects Key Project: Overview and Year 1 Status;;The LCO Outbursting Objects Key (LOOK) Project uses the telescopes of the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) Network to (1) systematically monitor a sample of previously discovered over the whole sky, to assess the evolutionary state of these distant remnants from the early solar system, and (2) use alerts from existing sky surveys to rapidly respond to and characterize detected outburst activity in all small bodies. The data gathered on outbursts helps to characterize each outburst's evolution with time, helps to assess the frequency and magnitude distribution of outbursts in general, and contributes to the understanding of outburst processes and volatile distribution in the solar system. The LOOK Project exploits the synergy between current and future wide-field surveys such as ZTF, Pan-STARRS, and LSST, as well as rapid-response telescope networks such as LCO, and serves as an excellent test bed for what will be needed for the much larger number of objects coming from Rubin Observatory. We will describe the LOOK Project goals, the planning and target selection (including the use of NEOexchange as a Target and Observation Manager or "TOM"), and results from the first phase of observations, including the detection of activity and outbursts on the giant comet C/2014 UN<SUB>271</SUB> (Bernardinelli-Bernstein) and the discovery and follow-up of 28 outbursts on 14 comets. Within these outburst discoveries, we present a high-cadence light curve of 7P/Pons-Winnecke with 10 outbursts observed over 90 days, a large outburst on 57P/duToit-Neujmin-Delporte, and evidence that comet P/2020 X1 (ATLAS) was in outburst when discovered.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PSJ.....3..173L
Probing the existence of the ZTF Casimir wormholes in the framework of f (R) gravity;;For the spherically symmetric static traversable wormholes, supported by the Casimir energy in f (R) = R + αR<SUP>2</SUP> Quadratic, f (R) =f<SUB>0</SUB>R<SUP>n</SUP> power-law Modified Gravity (MOG) theories we investigate energy conditions and dynamical stability of the wormhole solutions. Especially, we study Zero Tidal Forces (ZTF) Casimir WH's with anisotropic fluid located at the throat. By using the Casimir energy density and modified Einstein Field Equations (EFE's) we derived suitable shape functions for each modified gravity of our consideration. The stability of Casimir traversable wormholes in different modified gravity theories is also analyzed in our paper with a modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Voklov (MTOV) equation. Besides, we have numerically solved MTOV and derived hydrodynamical, anisotropic and extra forces, that is present due to the non-conserved stress-energy tensor. Moreover, other fundamental quantities, such as Volume Integral Quantifier and total gravitational energy were derived;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022NuPhB.98015845S
Estimating transient rates from cosmological simulations and BPASS;;The detection rate of electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) transients is growing exponentially. As the accuracy of the transient rates will significantly improve over the coming decades, so will our understanding of their evolution through cosmic history. To this end, we present predicted rates for EM and GW transients over the age of the universe using Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) results combined with four cosmic star formation histories (SFHs). These include a widely used empirical SFH of Madau & Dickinson and those from three cosmological simulations: MilliMillennium, EAGLE, and IllustrisTNG. We find that the choice of SFH changes our predictions: transients with short delay times are most affected by the star formation rate and change up to a factor of 2, while long delay time events tend to depend on the metallicity evolution of star formation and can change the predicted rate up to an order of magnitude. Importantly, we find that the cosmological simulations have very different metallicity evolution that cannot be reproduced by the widely used metallicity model of Langer & Norman, which impacts the binary black hole merger, stripped-envelope supernovae, and LGRBs in the local Universe most acutely. We recommend against using simple prescriptions for the metallicity evolution of the universe when predicting the rates of events that can have long delay times and that are sensitive to metallicity evolution.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.1315B
Nothing to see here: failed supernovae are faint or rare;;The absence of Type IIP core-collapse supernovae arising from progenitors above 17 solar masses suggests the existence of another evolutionary path by which massive stars end their lives. The direct collapse of a stellar core to a black hole without the production of a bright, explosive transient is expected to produce a long-lived, dim, red transient known as a failed supernova. Despite the detection of a number of candidates for disappearing massive stars in recent years, conclusive observational evidence for failed supernovae remains elusive. A custom-built pipeline designed for the detection of faint transients is used to re-analyse 10 yr of observations of 231 nearby galaxies from the PTF/ZTF surveys. This analysis recovers known supernovae, and yields a number of interesting transients. However, none of these are consistent with a failed supernova. Through Monte Carlo tests the recovery efficiency of our pipeline is quantified. By assuming failed supernovae occur as a Poissonian process with zero detections in the data set, 95 per cent upper limits to the rate of failed supernovae are calculated as a function of failed supernova absolute magnitude. We estimate failed supernovae to be less than 0.61, 0.33, 0.26, or 0.23 of the core-collapse SN rate for absolute magnitudes of -11, -12, -13, and -14, respectively. Finally, we show that if they exist, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will find 1.7-3.7 failed SNe per year for an absolute bolometric luminosity of ~6 × 10<SUP>39</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> out to distances of 33-43 Mpc, depending on their assumed spectral energy distribution.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.1188B
Stellar graveyards: clustering of compact objects in globular clusters NGC 3201 and NGC 6397;;We analyse Gaia EDR3 and re-calibrated HST proper motion data from the core-collapsed and non-core-collapsed globular clusters NGC 6397 and NGC 3201, respectively, with the Bayesian mass-orbit modelling code MAMPOSST-PM. We use Bayesian evidence and realistic mock data sets constructed with AGAMA to select between different mass models. In both clusters, the velocities are consistent with isotropy within the extent of our data. We robustly detect a dark central mass (DCM) of roughly $1000\, \rm M_\odot$ in both clusters. Our MAMPOSST-PM fits strongly prefer an extended DCM in NGC 6397, while only presenting a mild preference for it in NGC 3201, with respective sizes of a roughly one and a few per cent of the cluster effective radius. We explore the astrophysics behind our results with the CMC Monte Carlo N-body code, whose snapshots best matching the phase space observations lead to similar values for the mass and size of the DCM. The internal kinematics are thus consistent with a population of hundreds of massive white dwarfs in NGC 6397, and roughly 100 segregated stellar-mass black holes in NGC 3201, as previously found with CMC. Such analyses confirm the accuracy of both mass-orbit modelling and Monte Carlo N-body techniques, which together provide more robust predictions on the DCM of globular clusters (core-collapsed or not). This opens possibilities to understand a vast range of interesting astrophysical phenomena in clusters, such as fast radio bursts, compact object mergers, and gravitational waves.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514..806V
Infrared and optical detectability of Dyson spheres at white dwarf stars;;It has been hypothesized that advanced technological civilizations will construct giant space colonies and supporting infrastructures to orbit about their home stars. With data from recent satellites that operate at infrared and optical wavelengths (Spitzer, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, Kepler), in company with a few modest assumptions, it is now possible to begin to constrain observationally the frequency of such space-based civilizations in our Milky Way Galaxy.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514..227Z
Discovery of a highly eccentric, chromospherically active binary: ASASSN-V J192114.84+624950.8;;As part of an All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) search for sources with large flux decrements, we discovered a transient where the quiescent, stellar source ASASSN-V J192114.84+624950.8 rapidly decreased in flux by $\sim 55{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ (~0.9 mag) in the g band. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite light curve revealed that the source is a highly eccentric, eclipsing binary. Fits to the light curve using PHOEBE find the binary orbit to have e = 0.79, P<SUB>orb</SUB> = 18.462 d, and i = 88.6°, and the ratios of the stellar radii and temperatures to be R<SUB>2</SUB>/R<SUB>1</SUB> = 0.71 and T<SUB>e,2</SUB>/T<SUB>e,1</SUB> = 0.82. Both stars are chromospherically active, allowing us to determine their rotational periods of P<SUB>1</SUB> = 1.52 d and P<SUB>2</SUB> = 1.79 d, respectively. A Large Binocular Telescope/Multi-Object Double Spectrograph spectrum shows that the primary is a late-G- or early-K-type dwarf. Fits to the spectral energy distribution show that the luminosities and temperatures of the two stars are L<SUB>1</SUB> = 0.48 L<SUB>⊙</SUB>, $T_1= 5050\, \mathrm{K}$, L<SUB>2</SUB> = 0.12 L<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and $T_{2} = 4190\, \mathrm{K}$. We conclude that ASASSN-V J192114.84+624950.8 consists of two chromospherically active, rotational variable stars in a highly elliptical eclipsing orbit.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514..200W
How long can luminous blue variables sleep? A long-term photometric variability and spectral study of the Galactic candidate luminous blue variable MN 112;;Luminous blue variables (LBVs) are massive stars that show strong spectral and photometric variability. The questions of what evolutionary stages they represent and what exactly drives their instability are still open, and thus it is important to understand whether LBVs without significant ongoing activity exist, and for how long such dormant LBVs may 'sleep'. In this paper we investigate the long-term variability properties of the LBV candidate MN 112, by combining its optical and infrared spectral data covering 12 years with photometric data covering nearly a century, as acquired from both modern time-domain sky surveys and historical photographic plates. We analyse the spectra, derive the physical properties of the star by modelling its atmosphere, and use a new distance estimate from Gaia data release 3 (DR3) to determine the position of MN 112 both inside the Galaxy and in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The distance estimation has almost doubled in comparison with Gaia DR2. Because of this, MN 112 moved to upper part of the diagram, and according to our modelling it lies on an evolutionary track for a star with initial mass $M_*=70~\rm M_\odot$ near the Humphreys-Davidson limit. Given the absence of any significant variability, we conclude that the star is a dormant LBV that has now been inactive for at least a century.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.5752M
SN 2020acat: an energetic fast rising Type IIb supernova;;The ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) photometric and optical spectroscopic observations of SN 2020acat covering ~250 d after explosion are presented here. Using the fast rising photometric observations, spanning from the UV to NIR wavelengths, a pseudo-bolometric light curve was constructed and compared to several other well-observed Type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb). SN 2020acat displayed a very short rise time reaching a peak luminosity of $\mathrm{{\rm Log}_{10}}(L) = 42.49 \pm 0.17 \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ in only ~14.6 ± 0.3 d. From modelling of the pseudo-bolometric light curve, we estimated a total mass of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni synthesized by SN 2020acat of M<SUB>Ni</SUB> = 0.13 ± 0.03 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, with an ejecta mass of M<SUB>ej</SUB> = 2.3 ± 0.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a kinetic energy of E<SUB>k</SUB> = 1.2 ± 0.3 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg. The optical spectra of SN 2020acat display hydrogen signatures well into the transitional period (≳ 100 d), between the photospheric and the nebular phases. The spectra also display a strong feature around 4900 Å that cannot be solely accounted for by the presence of the Fe II 5018 line. We suggest that the Fe II feature was augmented by He I 5016 and possibly by the presence of N II 5005. From both photometric and spectroscopic analysis, we inferred that the progenitor of SN 2020acat was an intermediate-mass compact star with an M<SUB>ZAMS</SUB> of 15-20 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.5540M
Low luminosity Type II supernovae - IV. SN 2020cxd and SN 2021aai, at the edges of the sub-luminous supernovae class;;Photometric and spectroscopic data for two Low Luminosity Type IIP Supernovae (LL SNe IIP) 2020cxd and 2021aai are presented. SN 2020cxd was discovered 2 d after explosion at an absolute magnitude of M<SUB>r</SUB> = -14.02 ± 0.21 mag, subsequently settling on a plateau which lasts for ~120 d. Through the luminosity of the late light curve tail, we infer a synthesized <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass of (1.8 ± 0.5) × 10<SUP>-3 </SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. During the early evolutionary phases, optical spectra show a blue continuum ($T\,  $8000 K) with broad Balmer lines displaying a P Cygni profile, while at later phases, Ca II, Fe II, Sc II, and Ba II lines dominate the spectra. Hydrodynamical modelling of the observables yields $R\, \simeq$ 575 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> for the progenitor star, with M<SUB>ej</SUB> = 7.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and $E\, \simeq$ 0.097 foe emitted during the explosion. This low-energy event originating from a low-mass progenitor star is compatible with both the explosion of a red supergiant (RSG) star and with an Electron Capture Supernova arising from a super asymptotic giant branch star. SN 2021aai reaches a maximum luminosity of M<SUB>r</SUB> = -16.57 ± 0.23 mag (correcting for A<SUB>V</SUB> = 1.92 mag), at the end of its remarkably long plateau (~140 d). The estimated <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass is (1.4 ± 0.5) × 10<SUP>-2</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The expansion velocities are compatible with those of other LL SNe IIP (few 10<SUP>3</SUP> km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). The physical parameters obtained through hydrodynamical modelling are $R\, \simeq$ 575 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>, M<SUB>ej</SUB> = 15.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and E = 0.4 foe. SN 2021aai is therefore interpreted as the explosion of an RSG, with properties that bridge the class of LL SNe IIP with standard SN IIP events.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.4983V
SN 2019va: a Type IIP Supernova with Large Influence of Nickel-56 Decay on the Plateau-phase Light Curve;;We present multiband photometric and spectroscopic observations of the type II supernova, (SN) 2019va, which shows an unusually flat plateau-phase evolution in its V-band light curve. Its pseudo-bolometric light curve even shows a weak brightening towards the end of the plateau phase. These uncommon features are related to the influence of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni decay on the light curve during the plateau phase, when the SN emission is usually dominated by cooling of the envelope. The inferred <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass of SN 2019va is 0.088 ± 0.018 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, which is significantly larger than most SNe II. To estimate the influence of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni decay on the plateau-phase light curve, we calculate the ratio (dubbed as η<SUB>Ni</SUB>) between the integrated time-weighted energy from <SUP>56</SUP>Ni decay and that from envelope cooling within the plateau phase, obtaining a value of 0.8 for SN 2019va, which is the second largest value among SNe II that has been measured. After removing the influence of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni decay on the plateau-phase light curve, we found that the progenitor/explosion parameters derived for SN 2019va are more reasonable. In addition, SN 2019va is found to have weaker metal lines in its spectra compared to other SNe IIP at similar epochs, implying a low-metallicity progenitor, which is consistent with the metal-poor environment inferred from the host-galaxy spectrum. We further discuss the possible reasons that might lead to SN 2019va-like events.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.4556Z
Circular polarimetry of suspect wind-accreting magnetic pre-polars;;We present results from a circular polarimetric survey of candidate detached magnetic white dwarf - M dwarf binaries obtained using the Nordic Optical Telescope, La Palma. We obtained phase resolved spectropolarimetry and imaging polarimetry of seven systems, five of which show clearly variable circular polarisation. The data indicate that these targets have white dwarfs with magnetic field strengths >80 MG. Our study reveals that cyclotron emission can dominate the optical luminosity at wavelengths corresponding to the cyclotron emission harmonics, even in systems where the white dwarfs are only wind-accreting. This implies that a very significant fraction of the stellar wind of the companion star is captured by the magnetic white dwarf reducing the magnetic braking in pre-cataclysmic variables (CVs). Furthermore, the polarimetric confirmation of several detached, wind-accreting magnetic systems provides observational constraints on the models of magnetic CV evolution and white dwarf magnetic field generation. We also find that the white dwarf magnetic field configuration in at least two of these systems appears to be very complex.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.3858H
Close detached white dwarf + brown dwarf binaries: further evidence for low values of the common envelope efficiency;;Common envelope evolution is a fundamental ingredient in our understanding of the formation of close binary stars containing compact objects that include the progenitors of type Ia supernovae, short gamma-ray bursts, and most stellar gravitational wave sources. To predict the outcome of common envelope evolution, we still rely to a large degree on a simplified energy conservation equation. Unfortunately, this equation contains a theoretically rather poorly constrained efficiency parameter (α<SUB>CE</SUB>) and, even worse, it is unclear if energy sources in addition to orbital energy (such as recombination energy) contribute to the envelope ejection process. In previous works, we reconstructed the evolution of observed populations of post-common envelope binaries (PCEBs) consisting of white dwarfs with main-sequence star companions and found indications that the efficiency is rather small (α<SUB>CE</SUB> ≃ 0.2-0.3) and that extra energy sources are only required in very few cases. Here, we used the same reconstruction tool to investigate the evolutionary history of a sample of observed PCEBs with brown dwarf companions. In contrast to previous works, we found that the evolution of observationally well-characterized PCEBs with brown dwarf companions can be understood assuming a low common envelope efficiency (α<SUB>CE</SUB> = 0.24-0.41), similar to that required to understand PCEBs with main-sequence star companions, and that contributions from recombination energy are not required. We conclude that the vast majority of PCEBs form from common envelope evolution that can be parametrized with a small efficiency and without taking into account additional energy sources.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.3587Z
An Hα survey of the host environments of 77 type IIn supernovae within z < 0.02;;Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are an uncommon and highly heterogeneous class of SN where the SN ejecta interact with pre-existing circumstellar media (CSM). Previous studies have found a mass ladder in terms of the association of the SN location with H α emission and the progenitor masses of SN classes. In this paper, we present the largest environmental study of SNe IIn. We analyse the H α environments of 77 type SNeIIn using continuum subtracted H α images. We use the pixel statistics technique, normalized cumulative ranking (NCR), to associate SN pixels with H α emission. We find that our 77 SNe IIn do not follow the H α emission. This is not consistent with the proposed progenitors of SNe IIn, luminous blue variables (LBVs) as LBVs are high-mass stars that undergo dramatic episodic mass loss. However, a subset of the NCR values follow the H α emission, suggesting a population of high-mass progenitors. This suggests there may be multiple progenitor paths with ~60 per cent having non-zero NCR values with a distribution consistent with high-mass progenitors such as LBVs and ~40 per cent of these SNe not being associated with H α emission. We discuss the possible progenitor routes of SNe IIn, especially for the zero NCR value population. We also investigate the radial distribution of the SNe in their hosts in terms of H α and r'-band flux.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.3564R
Asteroid phase curves using sparse Gaia DR2 data and differential dense light curves;;The amount of sparse asteroid photometry being gathered by both space- and ground-based surveys is growing exponentially. This large volume of data poses a computational challenge owing to both the large amount of information to be processed and the new methods needed to combine data from different sources (e.g. obtained by different techniques, in different bands, and having different random and systematic errors). The main goal of this work is to develop an algorithm capable of merging sparse and dense data sets, both relative and differential, in preparation for asteroid observations originating from, for example, Gaia, TESS, ATLAS, LSST, K2, VISTA, and many other sources. We present a novel method to obtain asteroid phase curves by combining sparse photometry and differential ground-based photometry. In the traditional approach, the latter cannot be used for phase curves. Merging those two data types allows for the extraction of phase-curve information for a growing number of objects. Our method is validated for 26 sample asteroids observed by the Gaia mission.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.3242W
Pipeline for the Antarctic Survey Telescope 3-3 in Yaoan, Yunnan;;AST3-3 is the third robotic facility of the Antarctic Survey Telescopes (AST3) for transient surveys to be deployed at Dome A, Antarctica. Due to the current pandemic, the telescope has been currently deployed at the Yaoan Observation Station in China, starting the commissioning observation and a transient survey. This article presented a fully automatic data processing system for AST3-3 observations. The transient detection pipeline uses state-of-the-art image subtraction techniques optimized for GPU devices. Image reduction and transient photometry are accelerated by concurrent task methods. Our Python-based system allows for transient detection from wide-field data in a real-time and accurate way. A ResNet-based rotational-invariant neural network was employed to classify the transient candidates. As a result, the system enables the auto-generation of transients and their light curves.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022FrASS...9.7100S
pyobs - An Observatory Control System for Robotic Telescopes;;We present a Python-based framework for the complete operation of a robotic telescope observatory. It provides out-of-the-box support for many popular camera types while other hardware like telescopes, domes, and weather stations can easily be added via a thin abstraction layer to existing code. Common functionality like focusing, acquisition, auto-guiding, sky-flat acquisition, and pipeline calibration are ready for use. A remote-control interface, a "mastermind" for truly robotic operations as well as an interface to the Las Cumbres Observatory observation portal is included. The whole system is fully configurable and easily extendable. We are currently running pyobs successfully on three different types of telescopes, of which one is a siderostat for observing the Sun. pyobs uses open standards and open software wherever possible and is itself freely available.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022FrASS...9.1486H
Ultra-short period contact binaries: restricting the parameters of the primary using Gaia parallax;;Possible M-type contact binaries were investigated by selecting W UMa-type variables with orbital periods below the 0.22-day cutoff. Gaia parallaxes were combined with Gaia and 2MASS photometry to obtain G and J-band absolute magnitudes of 674 red variable stars catalogued as contact binaries in the VSX database. The absolute magnitude of main sequence cool dwarfs varies strongly with spectral type, which was used to create a selection of 218 systems with primaries potentially of spectral types M0-M3. Lightcurves of the 46 systems with lowest near-infrared luminosities were inspected individually to confirm or reject the W UMa classification where possible. The extinction limits and amplitudes were combined with the calculated absolute magnitudes in order to set upper limits for the masses of the primary components. This is achieved via the consideration that the luminosity of the primary is no less than that of a main sequence star of the same mass. For 26 possible contact binaries the mass of the primary was limited to less than 0.5 solar masses with some systems having upper limits for the primary as low as 0.35 solar masses. These rare systems are intriguing targets for more detailed observations since they are on the low-mass end of the contact binary distribution and their formation and evolution are still unclear.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022BlgAJ..37...46K
Search for Pre-Burst Emission from Binary Neutron Star Mergers with Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma;;Close binary systems consisting of two neutron stars (BNS) emit gravitational waves, that allow them to merge on timescales shorter than Hubble time. It is widely believed, that NS-NS mergers in such systems power short gamma-ray bursts (GRB). Several mechanisms which could lead to electromagnetic energy release prior to a merger have been proposed. We estimate the ability to observe the possible pre-burst emission with telescopes of Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma. We also investigate first such event, GRB210919A, which fell into the field of view of the SRG telescopes less than two days before the burst.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AstL...48..370M
Realistic Detection and Early Warning of Binary Neutron Stars with Decihertz Gravitational-wave Observatories;;We investigated the detection rates and early-warning parameters of binary neutron star (BNS) populations with decihertz gravitational-wave observatories in a realistic detecting strategy. Assuming the operation time of B-DECIGO is 4 yr, we classified the detectable BNSs based on parameter precision into three categories: (a) sources that merge within 1 yr, which could be localized with an uncertainty of ΔΩ ~ 10<SUP>0</SUP> deg<SUP>2</SUP>; (b) sources that merge in 1-4 yr, which take up three-quarters of the total events and yield the most precise angular resolution with ΔΩ ~ 10<SUP>-2</SUP> deg<SUP>2</SUP> and time-of-merger accuracy with Δt <SUB> c </SUB> ~ 10<SUP>-1</SUP> s; and (c) sources that do not merge during the 4 yr mission window, which enable possible early warnings, with ΔΩ ~ 10<SUP>-1</SUP> deg<SUP>2</SUP> and Δt <SUB> c </SUB> ~ 10<SUP>0</SUP> s. Furthermore, we compared the pros and cons of B-DECIGO with the third-generation ground-based detectors, and explored the prospects of detections using three other decihertz observatories and four BNS population models. In realistic observing scenarios, we found that decihertz detectors could even provide early-warning alerts to a source decades before its merger while their localizations are still as accurate as ground-based facilities. Finally we found a decrease of events when considering the confusion noise, but this could be partially solved by a proper noise subtraction.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...934...84L
Models of Millimeter and Radio Emission from Interacting Supernovae;;This work utilizes established models of synchrotron-powered light curves for core-collapse supernovae in dense circumstellar environments, namely, type IIn and Ibn, to demonstrate the potential for detecting millimeter emission from these events. The progenitor types of these supernovae are still an open question, but using the synchrotron light curves as probes for the circumstellar environments could shed light on the mass-loss histories of the progenitors and discern between different theories. Observations in millimeter bands are particularly fruitful, as they probe regions at smaller radii and higher ambient densities, where centimeter emission tends to be self-absorbed. In our application of these light curves, we explore a diversity of progenitor types and mass-loss profiles to understand their effects on the light-curve shapes. Additionally, we fit model parameters to the 8 GHz light curve of type IIn supernova 2006jd and then create millimeter light curves using these parameters to show the possibility of detecting an early millimeter peak from such an event. We predict that next generation millimeter surveys will possess the capability to detect nearby and extreme events. However, there is a pressing need for millimeter follow-up of optically discovered interacting supernovae to more completely sample the true population.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...934....5Y
MUSSES2020J: The Earliest Discovery of a Fast Blue Ultraluminous Transient at Redshift 1.063;;In this Letter, we report the discovery of an ultraluminous fast-evolving transient in rest-frame UV wavelengths, MUSSES2020J, soon after its occurrence by using the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) mounted on the 8.2 m Subaru telescope. The rise time of about 5 days with an extremely high UV peak luminosity shares similarities to a handful of fast blue optical transients whose peak luminosities are comparable with the most luminous supernovae while their timescales are significantly shorter (hereafter "fast blue ultraluminous transient," FBUT). In addition, MUSSES2020J is located near the center of a normal low-mass galaxy at a redshift of 1.063, suggesting a possible connection between the energy source of MUSSES2020J and the central part of the host galaxy. Possible physical mechanisms powering this extreme transient such as a wind-driven tidal disruption event and an interaction between supernova and circumstellar material are qualitatively discussed based on the first multiband early-phase light curve of FBUTs, although whether the scenarios can quantitatively explain the early photometric behavior of MUSSES2020J requires systematical theoretical investigations. Thanks to the ultrahigh luminosity in UV and blue optical wavelengths of these extreme transients, a promising number of FBUTs from the local to the high-z universe can be discovered through deep wide-field optical surveys in the near future.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933L..36J
Tidal Disruption on Stellar-mass Black Holes in Active Galactic Nuclei;;Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can funnel stars and stellar remnants from the vicinity of the galactic center into the inner plane of the AGN disk. Stars reaching this inner region can be tidally disrupted by the stellar-mass black holes in the disk. Such micro tidal disruption events (micro-TDEs) could be a useful probe of stellar interaction with the AGN disk. We find that micro-TDEs in AGNs occur at a rate of ~170 Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Their cleanest observational probe may be the electromagnetic detection of tidal disruption in AGNs by heavy supermassive black holes (M <SUB>•</SUB> ≳ 10<SUP>8</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) that cannot tidally disrupt solar-type stars. The reconstructed rate of such events from observations, nonetheless, appears to be much lower than our estimated micro-TDE rate. We discuss two such micro-TDE candidates observed to date (ASASSN-15lh and ZTF19aailpwl).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933L..28Y
Two Candidate KH 15D-like Systems from the Zwicky Transient Facility;;KH 15D contains a circumbinary disk that is tilted relative to the orbital plane of the central binary. The precession of the disk and the orbital motion of the binary together produce rich phenomena in the photometric light curve. In this work, we present the discovery and preliminary analysis of two objects that resemble the key features of KH 15D from the Zwicky Transient Facility. These new objects, Bernhard-1 and Bernhard-2, show large-amplitude ( >1.5 mag), long-duration (more than tens of days), and periodic dimming events. A one-sided screen model is developed to model the photometric behavior of these objects, the physical interpretation of which is a tilted, warped circumbinary disk occulting the inner binary. Changes in the object light curves suggest potential precession periods over timescales longer than 10 yr. Additional photometric and spectroscopic observations are encouraged to better understand the nature of these interesting systems.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933L..21Z
Hubble Space Telescope Observations of Active Asteroid P/2020 O1 (Lemmon-PANSTARRS);;We present Hubble Space Telescope observations of active asteroid P/2020 O1 taken to examine its development for a year after perihelion. We find that the mass loss peaks at ≲1 kg s<SUP>-1</SUP> in 2020 August and then declines to nearly zero over four months. Long-duration mass loss (~180 days) is consistent with a sublimation origin, indicating that this object is likely an ice-bearing main-belt comet. Equilibrium sublimation of water ice from an area as small as 1580 m<SUP>2</SUP> can supply the observed mass loss. Time-series photometry shows tentative evidence for extremely rapid rotation (double-peaked period <2 hr) of the small nucleus (effective radius ~420 m). Ejection velocities of 0.1 mm particles are comparable to the 0.3 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> gravitational escape speed from the nucleus, while larger particles are ejected at speeds less than the escape velocity. These properties are consistent with the sublimation of near-surface ice aided by centripetal acceleration. If water-ice sublimation is confirmed, P/2020 O1 would be an icy asteroid with the smallest semimajor axis (highest temperature), setting new bounds on the distribution of ice in the asteroid belt.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933L..15K
Hydrodynamics of Collisions and Close Encounters between Stellar Black Holes and Main-sequence Stars;;Recent analyses have shown that close encounters between stars and stellar black holes occur frequently in dense star clusters. Depending upon the distance at closest approach, these interactions can lead to dissipating encounters such as tidal captures and disruptions, or direct physical collisions, all of which may be accompanied by bright electromagnetic transients. In this study, we perform a wide range of hydrodynamic simulations of close encounters between black holes and main-sequence stars that collectively cover the parameter space of interest, and we identify and classify the various possible outcomes. In the case of nearly head-on collisions, the star is completely disrupted with roughly half of the stellar material becoming bound to the black hole. For more distant encounters near the classical tidal-disruption radius, the star is only partially disrupted on the first pericenter passage. Depending upon the interaction details, the partially disrupted stellar remnant may be tidally captured by the black hole or become unbound (in some cases, receiving a sufficiently large impulsive kick from asymmetric mass loss to be ejected from its host cluster). In the former case, the star will undergo additional pericenter passages before ultimately being disrupted fully. Based on the properties of the material bound to the black hole at the end of our simulations (in particular, the total bound mass and angular momentum), we comment upon the expected accretion process and associated electromagnetic signatures that are likely to result.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933..203K
Investigating the Nature of the Luminous Ambiguous Nuclear Transient ASASSN-17jz;;We present observations of the extremely luminous but ambiguous nuclear transient (ANT) ASASSN-17jz, spanning roughly 1200 days of the object's evolution. ASASSN-17jz was discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) in the galaxy SDSS J171955.84+414049.4 on UT 2017 July 27 at a redshift of z = 0.1641. The transient peaked at an absolute B-band magnitude of M <SUB> B,peak</SUB> = -22.81, corresponding to a bolometric luminosity of L <SUB>bol,peak</SUB> = 8.3 × 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, and exhibited late-time ultraviolet emission that was still ongoing in our latest observations. Integrating the full light curve gives a total emitted energy of E <SUB>tot</SUB> = (1.36 ±0.08) × 10<SUP>52</SUP> erg, with (0.80 ± 0.02) × 10<SUP>52</SUP> erg of this emitted within 200 days of peak light. This late-time ultraviolet emission is accompanied by increasing X-ray emission that becomes softer as it brightens. ASASSN-17jz exhibited a large number of spectral emission lines most commonly seen in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with little evidence of evolution. It also showed transient Balmer features, which became fainter and broader over time, and are still being detected >1000 days after peak brightness. We consider various physical scenarios for the origin of the transient, including supernovae (SNe), tidal disruption events, AGN outbursts, and ANTs. We find that the most likely explanation is that ASASSN-17jz was a SN IIn occurring in or near the disk of an existing AGN, and that the late-time emission is caused by the AGN transitioning to a more active state.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933..196H
A Long-period Pre-ELM System Discovered from the LAMOST Medium-resolution Survey;;We present LAMOST J041920.07+072545.4 (hereafter J0419), a close binary consisting of a bloated, extremely low mass pre-white dwarf (pre-ELM WD) and a compact object with an orbital period of 0.607189 days. The large-amplitude ellipsoidal variations and the evident Balmer and He I emission lines suggest a filled Roche lobe and ongoing mass transfer. No outburst events were detected in the 15 years of monitoring of J0419, indicating a very low mass transfer rate. The temperature of the pre-ELM, ${T}_{\mathrm{eff}}={5793}_{-133}^{+124}\,{\rm{K}}$ , makes it cooler than the known ELMs, but hotter than most cataclysmic variable donors. Combining the mean density within the Roche lobe and the radius constrained from our spectral energy distribution fitting, we obtain the mass of the pre-ELM, M <SUB>1</SUB> = 0.176 ± 0.014 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The joint fitting of light and radial velocity curves yields an inclination angle of $i={66.5}_{-1.7}^{+1.4}$ degrees, corresponding to a mass of the compact object of M <SUB>2</SUB> = 1.09 ± 0.05 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The very bloated pre-ELM has a smaller surface gravity ( $\mathrm{log}g=3.9\pm 0.01$ , R <SUB>1</SUB> = 0.78 ± 0.02 R <SUB>⊙</SUB>) than the known ELMs or pre-ELMs. The temperature and the luminosity ( ${L}_{\mathrm{bol}}={0.62}_{-0.10}^{+0.11}\,{L}_{\odot }$ ) of J0419 are close to those of the main sequence, which makes the selection of such systems through the H-R diagram inefficient. Based on the evolutionary model, the relatively long period and small $\mathrm{log}g$ indicate that J0419 could be close to the "bifurcation period" in the orbital evolution, which makes J0419 a unique source to connect ELM/pre-ELM WD systems, wide binaries, and cataclysmic variables.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933..193Z
The Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey: Changing-look Quasar Candidates from Multi-epoch Spectroscopy in SDSS-IV;;Active galactic nuclei (AGN) can vary significantly in their rest-frame optical/UV continuum emission, and with strong associated changes in broad line emission, on much shorter timescales than predicted by standard models of accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Most such changing-look or changing-state AGN-and at higher luminosities, changing-look quasars (CLQs)-have been found via spectroscopic follow-up of known quasars showing strong photometric variability. The Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) includes repeat spectroscopy of large numbers of previously known quasars, many selected irrespective of photometric variability, and with spectral epochs separated by months to decades. Our visual examination of these repeat spectra for strong broad line variability yielded 61 newly discovered CLQ candidates. We quantitatively compare spectral epochs to measure changes in continuum and Hβ broad line emission, finding 19 CLQs, of which 15 are newly recognized. The parent sample includes only broad line quasars, so our study tends to find objects that have dimmed, i.e., turn-off CLQs. However, we nevertheless find four turn-on CLQs that meet our criteria, albeit with broad lines in both dim and bright states. We study the response of Hβ and Mg II emission lines to continuum changes. The Eddington ratios of CLQs are low, and/or their Hβ broad line width is large relative to the overall quasar population. Repeat quasar spectroscopy in the upcoming SDSS-V black hole Mapper program will reveal significant numbers of CLQs, enhancing our understanding of the frequency and duty cycle of such strong variability, and the physics and dynamics of the phenomenon.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933..180G
A Late-time Radio Flare Following a Possible Transition in Accretion State in the Tidal Disruption Event AT 2019azh;;We report here radio follow-up observations of the optical tidal disruption event (TDE) AT 2019azh. Previously reported X-ray observations of this TDE showed variability at early times and a dramatic increase in luminosity, by a factor of ~10, about 8 months after optical discovery. The X-ray emission is mainly dominated by intermediate hard-soft X-rays and is exceptionally soft around the X-ray peak, which is L <SUB> X </SUB> ~ 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The high cadence 15.5 GHz observations reported here show an early rise in radio emission followed by an approximately constant light curve, and a late-time flare. This flare starts roughly at the time of the observed X-ray peak luminosity and reaches its peak about 110 days after the peak in the X-ray, and a year after optical discovery. The radio flare peaks at ν L <SUB> ν </SUB> ~ 10<SUP>38</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, a factor of two higher than the emission preceding the flare. In light of the late-time radio and X-ray flares, and the X-ray spectral evolution, we speculate a possible transition in the accretion state of this TDE, similar to the observed behavior in black hole X-ray binaries. We compare the radio properties of AT 2019azh to other known TDEs, and focus on the similarities to the late-time radio flare of the TDE ASASSN-15oi.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933..176S
Photometry on Structured Backgrounds: Local Pixel-wise Infilling by Regression;;Photometric pipelines struggle to estimate both the flux and flux uncertainty for stars in the presence of structured backgrounds such as filaments or clouds. However, it is exactly stars in these complex regions that are critical to understanding star formation and the structure of the interstellar medium. We develop a method, similar to Gaussian process regression, which we term local pixel-wise infilling (LPI). Using a local covariance estimate, we predict the background behind each star and the uncertainty of that prediction in order to improve estimates of flux and flux uncertainty. We show the validity of our model on synthetic data and real dust fields. We further demonstrate that the method is stable even in the crowded field limit. While we focus on optical-IR photometry, this method is not restricted to those wavelengths. We apply this technique to the 34 billion detections in the second data release of the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey. In addition to removing many >3σ outliers and improving uncertainty estimates by a factor of ~2-3 on nebulous fields, we also show that our method is well behaved on uncrowded fields. The entirely post-processing nature of our implementation of LPI photometry allows it to easily improve the flux and flux uncertainty estimates of past as well as future surveys.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933..155S
Mass-ratio Distribution of Binaries from the LAMOST-MRS Survey;;Binary evolution leads to the formation of important objects that are crucial for the development of astrophysics, but the statistical properties of binary populations are still poorly understood. The LAMOST-MRS has provided a large sample of stars to study the properties of binary populations, especially for the mass-ratio distributions and binary fractions. We have devised a peak amplitude ratio (PAR) approach to derive the mass ratio of a binary system based on results obtained from its spectrum. By computing a cross-correlation function, we established a relation between the derived mass ratio and the PARs of the binary systems. By using spectral observations obtained from LAMSOT DR6 and DR7, we applied the PAR approach to form distributions of the derived mass ratio of the binary systems to the spectral types. We selected the mass ratio within the range of 0.6-1.0 to investigate the mass-ratio distribution. Through a power-law fitting, we obtained power index γ values of -0.42 ± 0.27, 0.03 ± 0.12, and 2.12 ± 0.19 for the A-, F-, and G-type stars identified in the sample, respectively. The derived γ-values display an increasing trend toward lower primary star masses, and G-type binaries tend to be twins more frequently. The close binary fractions (for P ≲ 150 days and q ≳ 0.6) in our sample for A, F, and G binaries are 7.6% ± 0.5%, 4.9% ± 0.2%, and 3.7% ± 0.1%, respectively. Note that the PAR approach can be applied to large spectroscopic surveys of stars.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933..119L
Variable Active Galactic Nuclei in the Galaxy Evolution Explorer Time Domain Survey;;We searched the northern hemisphere fields of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer Time Domain Survey for galaxies with UV variability indicative of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We identified 48 high-probability candidate AGNs from a parent sample of 1819 galaxies in the NASA Sloan Atlas catalog. We further characterized these systems using optical spectroscopic diagnostics, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer IR color selection criteria, and spectral energy distribution modeling. Of the 48 candidates, eight were identified as AGNs from optical emission lines, two were identified by their IR colors, and 28 were identified through spectral energy decomposition. Observational biases of each selection method are discussed in connecting these AGN subsamples to another. By selecting AGNs based on UV variability, we also identified six low-mass AGN candidates, all of which would have been missed by spectroscopic selection.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933...37W
A Library of Synthetic X-Ray Spectra for Fitting Tidal Disruption Events;;We present a tabulated version of our slim-disk model for fitting tidal disruption events (TDEs). We create a synthetic X-ray spectral library by ray-tracing stationary general relativistic slim disks and including gravitational redshift, Doppler, and lensing effects self-consistently. We introduce the library to reduce computational expense and increase access for fitting future events. Fitting requires interpolation between the library spectra; the interpolation error in the synthetic flux is generally <10% (it can rise to 40% when the disk is nearly edge-on). We fit the X-ray spectra of the TDEs ASASSN-14li and ASASSN-15oi, successfully reproducing our earlier constraints on black hole mass M <SUB>•</SUB> and spin a <SUB>•</SUB> from full on-the-fly ray-tracing. We use the library to fit mock observational data to explore the degeneracies among parameters, finding that (1) spectra from a hotter thermal disk and edge-on inclination angle offer tighter constraints on M <SUB>•</SUB> and a <SUB>•</SUB>; (2) the constraining power of spectra on M <SUB>•</SUB> and a <SUB>•</SUB> increases as a power law with the number of X-ray counts, and the index of the power law is higher for hotter thermal disk spectra; (3) multiepoch X-ray spectra partially break the degeneracy between M <SUB>•</SUB> and a <SUB>•</SUB>; (4) the time-dependent level of X-ray absorption can be constrained from spectral fitting. The tabulated model and slim-disk model are available at https://doi.org/10.25739/hfhz-xn60.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933...31W
Bumpy Declining Light Curves Are Common in Hydrogen-poor Superluminous Supernovae;;Recent work has revealed that the light curves of hydrogen-poor (Type I) superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), thought to be powered by magnetar central engines, do not always follow the smooth decline predicted by a simple magnetar spin-down model. Here we present the first systematic study of the prevalence and properties of "bumps" in the post-peak light curves of 34 SLSNe. We find that the majority (44%-76%) of events cannot be explained by a smooth magnetar model alone. We do not find any difference in supernova properties between events with and without bumps. By fitting a simple Gaussian model to the light-curve residuals, we characterize each bump with an amplitude, temperature, phase, and duration. We find that most bumps correspond with an increase in the photospheric temperature of the ejecta, although we do not see drastic changes in spectroscopic features during the bump. We also find a moderate correlation (ρ ≈ 0.5; p ≈ 0.01) between the phase of the bumps and the rise time, implying that such bumps tend to happen at a certain "evolutionary phase," (3.7 ± 1.4)t <SUB>rise</SUB>. Most bumps are consistent with having diffused from a central source of variable luminosity, although sources further out in the ejecta are not excluded. With this evidence, we explore whether the cause of these bumps is intrinsic to the supernova (e.g., a variable central engine) or extrinsic (e.g., circumstellar interaction). Both cases are plausible, requiring low-level variability in the magnetar input luminosity, small decreases in the ejecta opacity, or a thin circumstellar shell or disk.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...933...14H
An ALMA Search for High-albedo Objects Among the Midsized Jupiter Trojan Population;;We use Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) measurements of 870 μm thermal emission from a sample of midsized (15-40 km diameter) Jupiter Trojan asteroids to search for high-albedo objects in this population. We calculate the diameters and albedos of each object using a thermal model which also incorporates contemporaneous Zwicky Transient Facility photometry to accurately measure the absolute magnitude at the time of the ALMA observation. We find that while many albedos are lower than reported from WISE, several small Trojans have high albedos independently measured both from ALMA and from WISE. The number of these high-albedo objects is approximately consistent with expectations of the number of objects that recently have undergone large-scale impacts, suggesting that the interiors of freshly-crated Jupiter Trojans could contain high-albedo materials such as ices.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164...23S
Transient simulations for radio surveys;;Several new radio facilities have a field of view and sensitivity well suited for transient searches. This makes it more important than ever to accurately determine transient rates in radio surveys. The work presented here seeks to do this task by using Monte-Carlo simulations. In particular, the user inputs either a real or simulated observational setup, and the simulations code calculates transient rate as a function of transient duration and peak flux. These simulations allow for simulating a wide variety of scenarios including observations with varying sensitivities and durations, multiple overlapping telescope pointings, and a wide variety of light curve shapes with the user having the ability to easily add more. While the current scientific focus is on the radio regime, with examples given here from the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, the simulations code can be easily adapted to other wavelength regimes.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&C....4000629C
The NASA Multi-Messenger Astrophysics Science Support Center (MOSSAIC);;The era of Multi-messenger astrophysics has arrived, leading to key new discoveries and revealing a need for coordination, collaboration, and communication between world-wide communities using ground and space-based facilities. To fill these critical needs, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and Marshall Space Flight Center are jointly proposing to establish a virtual Multi-Messenger Astrophysics Science Support Center that focuses entirely on community-directed services. In this article, we describe the baseline plan for the virtual Support Center which will position the community and NASA as an Agency to extract maximum science from multi-messenger events, leading to new breakthroughs and fostering increased coordination and collaboration.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&C....4000582S
VLBI imaging of the pre-coalescence SMBHB candidate SDSS J143016.05+230344.4;;Context. Recently, SDSS J143016.05+230344.4 (J1430+2303) was reported to be a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) in the final coalescence phase. It is probably the first SMBHB coalescence event observable in human history. Radio observations of J1430+2303 before and after coalescence will provide a unique diagnosis of the energetics and environment of the SMBHB. 
 Aims: We explore the radio emission from the galactic nucleus region that is closely related to the current X-ray and optical activities and helps to understand the state of black hole accretion and outflow before coalescence. 
 Methods: Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging is the only method that offers milli-arcsecond-level high resolution that can exclude the contamination by diffuse emission on galactic scales. We observed J1430+2303 with the European VLBI Network at 1.7 GHz and with the Very Long Baseline Array at 1.6 and 4.9 GHz in late February and early March 2022. 
 Results: A compact component is detected in all three VLBI images. It has a brightness temperature of > 10<SUP>8</SUP> K, an unresolved morphology with a size < 0.8 pc, and a flat radio spectrum. These observational features are inconsistent with large opening-angle outflows or winds, but indicate that this compact component might be a jet or a corona. Nearly 60% of the emission is resolved by VLBI and may come from remnant lobes of previous radio activities, the outer layers of a structured jet, or shocks formed by the disc winds in the narrow line region. 
 Conclusions: Current VLBI images do not yet show signs of radio outbursts. Our observations provide pre-coalescence radio data that are an important reference for future comparative studies with the post-merger. In particular, further resolving the jet will pave the way for probing the dynamical features associated with inspiralling binary black holes.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...663A.139A
The 2175 Å bump features in FeLoBAL quasars: One indicator of MW-like dust in the nuclear region of quasars;;To investigate the properties of dust in the nuclear region of quasars, we explored the extinction curves of the iron low-ionisation broad absorption line (FeLoBAL) quasar SDSS J163004.29+311957.6 and its two analogues. The parametrised extinction curves indicated the Milky Way-like 2175 Å bump features in underlying extinction, which are similar to those seen in the Local Group and in a subset of high-redshift star-forming galaxies. Compared to the bump features in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the detections in this work are much closer to those in the Milky Way (MW). These bump features, as well as those in the high- and low-ionisation broad absorption line (BAL) quasars with 2175 Å bumps, are probably the counterpart of the 2175 Å bump features in the quasar environment. This type of dust grain is generally small, easily disrupted by high-energy photons, and has difficulty surviving in the radiation field of the active galactic nucleus. However, due to the presence of absorption-line outflows, the 2175 Å bump feature in quasars, which should be rare, is seen many times in BAL quasars. The shielding effect of outflow clouds allows the MW-like dust grains to be assembled or extends the survival period in the quasar nuclear region. The process and physical and chemical conditions deserve further observational study and investigation.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...663A..63Z
HD 133729: A blue large-amplitude pulsator in orbit around a main-sequence B-type star;;Blue large-amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) form a small group of hot objects pulsating in a fundamental radial mode with periods of the order of 30 min. Proposed evolutionary scenarios explain them as evolved low-mass stars: ∼0.3 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> shell-hydrogen-burning objects with a degenerated helium core, more massive (0.5-0.8) M<SUB>⊙</SUB> core-helium-burning stars, or ∼0.7 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> surviving companions of type Ia supernovae. Therefore, their origin remains to be established. Using data from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we discovered that HD 133729 is a binary consisting of a late B-type main-sequence star and a BLAP. The BLAP pulsates with a period of 32.37 min decreasing at a rate of ( − 7.11 ± 0.33) × 10<SUP>−11</SUP>. The light curve is typical for BLAPs, but it shows an unusual 40-s drop at the descending branch. Due to light dilution by a brighter companion, the observed amplitude of pulsation is much smaller than in other BLAPs. From available photometry, we derived times of maximum light, which revealed the binary nature of the star via an O−C diagram. The diagram shows variations with a period of 23.08433 d that we attribute to the light-travel-time effect in the system. The analysis of these variations allowed us to derive the spectroscopic parameters of the BLAP's orbit around the binary's centre of mass. The presence of a hot companion in the system was confirmed by the analysis of its spectral energy distribution, which was also used to place the components in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The obtained position of the BLAP fully agrees with the location of the other members of the class. With the estimated V ≈ 11 mag and the Gaia distance of less than 0.5 kpc, the BLAP is the brightest and the nearest of all known BLAPs. It may become a key object in the verification of the evolutionary scenarios for this class of variables. We argue that low-mass progenitors of the BLAP are excluded if the components are coeval and no mass transfer between the components took place.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...663A..62P
Fink: Early supernovae Ia classification using active learning;;Context. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will produce a continuous stream of alerts made of varying sources in the sky. This data flow will be publicly advertised and distributed to scientists via broker systems such as FINK, whose task is to extract scientific information from the stream. Given the complexity and volume of the data to be generated, LSST is a prime target for machine learning (ML) techniques. One of the most challenging stages of this task is the construction of appropriate training samples which enable learning based on a limited number of spectroscopically confirmed objects. 
 Aims: We describe how the FINK broker early supernova Ia (SN Ia) classifier optimizes its ML classifications by employing an active learning (AL) strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility of implementing such strategies in the current Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public alert data stream. 
 Methods: We compared the performance of two AL strategies: uncertainty sampling and random sampling. Our pipeline consists of three stages: feature extraction, classification, and learning strategy. Starting from an initial sample of ten alerts, including five SNe Ia and five non-Ia, we let the algorithm identify which alert should be added to the training sample. The system was allowed to evolve through 300 iterations. 
 Results: Our data set consists of 23 840 alerts from ZTF with a confirmed classification via a crossmatch with the SIMBAD database and the Transient Name Server (TNS), 1600 of which were SNe Ia (1021 unique objects). After the learning cycle was completed, the data configuration consisted of 310 alerts for training and 23 530 for testing. Averaging over 100 realizations, the classifier achieved ~89% purity and ~54% efficiency. From 01 November 2020 to 31 October 2021 FINK applied its early SN Ia module to the ZTF stream and communicated promising SN Ia candidates to the TNS. From the 535 spectroscopically classified FINK candidates, 459 (86%) were proven to be SNe Ia. 
 Conclusions: Our results confirm the effectiveness of AL strategies for guiding the construction of optimal training samples for astronomical classifiers. It demonstrates in real data that the performance of learning algorithms can be highly improved without the need of extra computational resources or overwhelmingly large training samples. This is, to our knowledge, the first application of AL to real alert data.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...663A..13L
TUVOpipe: A pipeline to search for UV transients with Swift-UVOT;;Despite the prevalence of transient-searching facilities operating across most wavelengths, the ultraviolet (UV) transient sky remains to be systematically studied. Therefore, we recently initiated the Transient Ultraviolet Objects (TUVO) project, with which we search for serendipitous UV transients in data obtained using currently available UV instruments with a strong focus on the UV and Optical (UVOT) telescope aboard the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (an overview of the project is described in a companion paper). Here, we describe the pipeline (named TUVOpipe) we constructed in order to find such transients in the UVOT data, using difference image analysis. The pipeline is run daily on all new public UVOT data (which are available 6-8 h after the observations are performed), so we discover transients in near real time. Transients that last >0.5 days are therefore still active when discovered, allowing for follow-up observations to be performed. From 01 October 2020 to the time of submission, we used the TUVOpipe to process 75 183 individual UVOT images, and we currently detect an average rate of ~100 transient candidates per day. Of these daily candidates, on average ~30% are real transients (separated by human vetting from the remaining "bogus" transients which were not discarded automatically within the pipeline). Most of the real transients correspond to known variable stars, though we also detect a significant number of known active galactic nuclei and accreting white dwarfs. The TUVOpipe can additionally run in archival mode, whereby all the archival UVOT data of a given field is scoured for `historical' transients; in this mode, we also mostly find variable stars. However, some of the transients we find (in particular in the real-time mode) represent previously unreported new transients or undiscovered outbursts of previously known transients, predominantly outbursts from cataclysmic variables. In this paper, we describe the operation of (both modes of) TUVOpipe and some of the initial results we have obtained so far.

Neutrinos from a Black Hole Snack;;Researchers have found new evidence that high-energy neutrinos are emitted when a black hole gobbles up a hapless star.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PhyOJ..15...77B
Candidate Tidal Disruption Event AT2019fdr Coincident with a High-Energy Neutrino;;The origins of the high-energy cosmic neutrino flux remain largely unknown. Recently, one high-energy neutrino was associated with a tidal disruption event (TDE). Here we present AT2019fdr, an exceptionally luminous TDE candidate, coincident with another high-energy neutrino. Our observations, including a bright dust echo and soft late-time x-ray emission, further support a TDE origin of this flare. The probability of finding two such bright events by chance is just 0.034%. We evaluate several models for neutrino production and show that AT2019fdr is capable of producing the observed high-energy neutrino, reinforcing the case for TDEs as neutrino sources.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PhRvL.128v1101R
Laboratory and On-sky Testing of an InGaAs Detector for Infrared Imaging;;We describe the results of testing a shortwave infrared CMOS camera using an indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) detector. The new generation of InGaAs detectors offers a cost-effective alternative to mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe) for astronomy research, with current, off-the-shelf cameras requiring no modification before use. Testing was conducted in the laboratory and on-sky while mounted to the robotic, 2 m Liverpool Telescope using a H-band filter. The camera exhibits a dark current of 821 e<SUP>-</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> pix<SUP>-1</SUP> and a bias level of 864 e<SUP>-</SUP> pix<SUP>-1</SUP>. The dark current associated shot noise is of similar size to the read noise of 32 e<SUP>-</SUP> pix<SUP>-1</SUP> in one-second exposures. Linearity within the count region where readout noise and bit-depth saturation effects are not dominant is within a few tenths of a per cent. After field-compression by fore optics, the plate-scale yields 0.″3 pix<SUP>-1</SUP>, near perfect for Nyquist sampling at the La Palma site. The sky background for the H-band filter dominates the other noise sources for the instrument for one-second exposures producing sky-limited photometry. On-sky observations show that milli-magnitude precision is achieved for sources <10.7 mag and a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 is achievable for 16th magnitude with a 3 minutes total exposure time, making it an ideal follow-up instrument for sources detected in current and upcoming IR surveys.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134f5001B
Confirming new changing-look AGNs discovered through optical variability using a random forest-based light-curve classifier;;Determining the frequency and duration of changing-look (CL) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) phenomena, where the optical broad emission lines appear or disappear, is crucial to understand the evolution of the accretion flow around supermassive black holes. We present a strategy to select new CL candidates starting from a spectroscopic type 2 AGN sample and searching for current type 1 photometric variability. We use the publicly available Zwicky Transient Facility alert stream and the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events light-curve classifier to produce a list of CL candidates with a highly automated algorithm, resulting in 60 candidates. Visual inspection reduced the sample to 30. We performed new spectroscopic observations of six candidates of our clean sample, without further refinement, finding the appearance of clear broad Balmer lines in four of them and tentative evidence of type changes in the remaining two, which suggests a promising success rate of ≥66 per cent for this CL selection method.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513L..57L
Characterizing eclipsing white dwarf M dwarf binaries from multiband eclipse photometry;;With the prevalence of wide-field, time-domain photometric sky surveys, the number of eclipsing white dwarf (WD) systems being discovered is increasing dramatically. An efficient method to follow these up will be key to determining any population trends and finding any particularly interesting examples. We demonstrate that multiband eclipse photometry of binaries containing a WD and an M dwarf can be used to determine the masses and temperatures of the WDs to better than 5 per cent. For the M dwarfs, we measure their parameters to a precision of better than 6 per cent with the uncertainty dominated by the intrinsic scatter of the M dwarf mass-radius relationship. This precision is better than what can typically be achieved with low-resolution spectroscopy. The nature of this method means that it will be applicable to LSST data in the future, enabling direct characterization without follow-up spectroscopy. Additionally, we characterize three new post-common-envelope binaries from their eclipse photometry, finding two systems containing hot helium-core WDs with low-mass companions (one near the brown dwarf transition regime) and a possible detached cataclysmic variable at the lower edge of the period gap.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.3050B
The detection efficiency of Type Ia supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility: limits on the intrinsic rate of early flux excesses;;Samples of young Type Ia supernovae have shown 'early excess' emission in a few cases. Similar excesses are predicted by some explosion and progenitor scenarios and hence can provide important clues regarding the origin of thermonuclear supernovae. They are, however, only predicted to last up to the first few days following explosion. It is therefore unclear whether such scenarios are intrinsically rare or whether the relatively small sample size simply reflects the difficulty in obtaining sufficiently early detections. To that end, we perform toy simulations covering a range of survey depths and cadences, and investigate the efficiency with which young Type Ia supernovae are recovered. As input for our simulations, we use models that broadly cover the range of predicted luminosities. Based on our simulations, we find that in a typical 3 d cadence survey, only ~10 per cent of Type Ia supernovae would be detected early enough to rule out the presence of an excess. A 2 d cadence, however, should see this increase to ~15 per cent. We find comparable results from more detailed simulations of the Zwicky Transient Facility surveys. Using the recovery efficiencies from these detailed simulations, we investigate the number of young Type Ia supernovae expected to be discovered assuming some fraction of the population comes from scenarios producing an excess at early times. Comparing the results of our simulations to observations, we find that the intrinsic fraction of Type Ia supernovae with early flux excesses is $\sim 28^{+13}_{-11}{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.3035M
The long-active afterglow of GRB 210204A: detection of the most delayed flares in a gamma-ray burst;;We present results from extensive broadband follow-up of GRB 210204A over the period of 30 d. We detect optical flares in the afterglow at 7.6 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> s and 1.1 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> s after the burst: the most delayed flaring ever detected in a GRB afterglow. At the source redshift of 0.876, the rest-frame delay is 5.8 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> s (6.71 d). We investigate possible causes for this flaring and conclude that the most likely cause is a refreshed shock in the jet. The prompt emission of the GRB is within the range of typical long bursts: it shows three disjoint emission episodes, which all follow the typical GRB correlations. This suggests that GRB 210204A might not have any special properties that caused late-time flaring, and the lack of such detections for other afterglows might be resulting from the paucity of late-time observations. Systematic late-time follow-up of a larger sample of GRBs can shed more light on such afterglow behaviour. Further analysis of the GRB 210204A shows that the late-time bump in the light curve is highly unlikely due to underlying SNe at redshift (z) = 0.876 and is more likely due to the late-time flaring activity. The cause of this variability is not clearly quantifiable due to the lack of multiband data at late-time constraints by bad weather conditions. The flare of GRB 210204A is the latest flare detected to date.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.2777K
The prospects of finding tidal disruption events with 2.5-m Wide-Field Survey Telescope based on mock observations;;Optical time-domain surveys have been the dominant means of hunting for rare tidal disruption events (TDEs) in the past decade and remarkably advanced the TDE study. Particularly, the Zwicky Transient Facility has opened the era of population studies, and the upcoming Large Survey of Space and Time at the Vera Rubin Observatory is believed to further revolutionize the field soon. Here, we present the prospects of finding TDEs with another powerful survey to be performed by 2.5-m Wide-Field Survey Telescope (WFST). The WFST, located in western China, will be the most advanced facility dedicated to optical time-domain surveys in the Northern hemisphere once commissioning. We choose to assess its TDE detectability on the basis of mock observations, which is hitherto closest to reality by taking into consideration site conditions, telescope parameters, survey strategy, and transient searching pipeline. Our mock observations on a 440-deg<SUP>2</SUP> field (CosmoDC2 catalogue) show that 29 ± 6 TDEs can be robustly found per year if observed at u, g, r, and i bands with 30-s exposure every 10 days, in which a discovery is defined as ≥10 epochal detections in at least two filters. If the WFST survey is fully optimized for discovering TDEs, we would expect to identify 392 ± 74 TDEs every year, with the redshift up to z ~ 0.8, which poses a huge challenge to follow-up resources.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.2422L
The OmegaWhite survey for short-period variable stars - VII. High amplitude short-period blue variables;;Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) are a relatively new class of blue variable stars showing periodic variations in their light curves with periods shorter than a few tens of minutes and amplitudes of more than 10 per cent. We report nine blue variable stars identified in the OmegaWhite survey conducted using ESO's VST, which shows a periodic modulation in the range 7-37 min and an amplitude in the range 0.11-0.28 mag. We have obtained a series of followup photometric and spectroscopic observations made primarily using SALT and telescopes at SAAO. We find four stars which we identify as BLAPs, one of which was previously known. One star, OW J0820-3301, appears to be a member of the V361 Hya class of pulsating stars and is spatially close to an extended nebula. One further star, OW J1819-2729, has characteristics similar to the sdAV pulsators. In contrast, OW J0815-3421 is a binary star containing an sdB and a white dwarf with an orbital period of 73.7 min, making it only one of six white dwarf-sdB binaries with an orbital period shorter than 80 min. Finally, high cadence photometry of four of the candidate BLAPs show features that we compare with notch-like features seen in the much longer period Cepheid pulsators.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.2215R
A standard siren cosmological measurement from the potential GW190521 electromagnetic counterpart ZTF19abanrhr;;The identification of the electromagnetic (EM) counterpart candidate ZTF19abanrhr to the binary black hole merger GW190521 opens the possibility to infer cosmological parameters from this standard siren with a uniquely identified host galaxy. The distant merger allows for cosmological inference beyond the Hubble constant. Here, we show that the three-dimensional spatial location of ZTF19abanrhr calculated from the EM data remains consistent with the latest sky localization of GW190521 provided by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration. If ZTF19abanrhr is associated with the GW190521 merger, and assuming a flat wCDM model, we find that $H_0=48^{+23}_{-10}\, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, $\Omega _m=0.35^{+0.41}_{-0.26}$, and $w_0=-1.31^{+0.61}_{-0.48}$ (median and $68{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ credible interval). If we use the Hubble constant value inferred from another gravitational-wave event, GW170817, as a prior for our analysis, together with assumption of a flat ΛCDM and the model-independent constraint on the physical matter density ω<SUB>m</SUB> from Planck, we find $H_0=68.9^{+8.7}_{-6.0}\, \mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.2152C
Machine learning for fast transients for the Deeper, Wider, Faster programme with the Removal Of BOgus Transients (ROBOT) pipeline;;The Deeper, Wider, Faster (DWF) programme is optimized to detect fast transients that show luminosity changes on time-scales of sub-second to days using fast cadence simultaneous observations and rapid response follow up. One of the significant bottlenecks in DWF is the time required to assess candidates for rapid follow up and to manually inspect candidates prior to triggering space-based or large ground-based telescopes. In this paper, we present the Removal Of BOgus Transients (ROBOTs) pipeline that uses a combination of machine learning methods, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Decision Tree (CART), to analyse source quality and to filter in promising candidates. The ROBOT pipeline is optimized for 'lossy' compressed data required by DWF for fast data transfer to find these candidates within minutes of the light hitting the telescopes. Preliminary testing of the ROBOT pipeline on archival data showed to reduce the number of candidates that require a manual inspection from 69 628 to 3327 (a factor of ~21 times), whilst simultaneously sorting candidates into categories of priority, with potential for further improvement. Recent real-time operation of the ROBOT pipeline in DWF-O10 showed to further reduce manual inspections from ~155 000 to ~5000 (a factor of ~31 times).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.1742G
The OmegaWhite survey for short-period variable stars - VI. Open clusters;;Using light curves with ~3 min cadence and a duration of 2 h made using the OmegaWhite survey, we present the results of a search for short-period variable stars in the field of 20 open clusters. We identified 92 variable stars in these fields. Using a range of cluster member catalogues and Gaia EDR3 data, we have determined that 10 are cluster members and 2 more are probable members. Based on their position on the Gaia HRD and their photometric periods, we find that most of these are δ Sct stars. We obtained low-resolution optical spectroscopy of some of these cluster members and field stars. We discuss the cluster variable stars in the context of δ Sct stars in other open clusters.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513..468T
Periodic stellar variability from almost a million NGTS light curves;;We analyse 829 481 stars from the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) to extract variability periods. We utilize a generalization of the autocorrelation function (the G-ACF), which applies to irregularly sampled time series data. We extract variability periods for 16 880 stars from late-A through to mid-M spectral types and periods between ~0.1 and 130 d with no assumed variability model. We find variable signals associated with a number of astrophysical phenomena, including stellar rotation, pulsations, and multiple-star systems. The extracted variability periods are compared with stellar parameters taken from Gaia DR2, which allows us to identify distinct regions of variability in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram. We explore a sample of rotational main-sequence objects in period-colour space, in which we observe a dearth of rotation periods between 15 and 25 d. This 'bi-modality' was previously only seen in space-based data. We demonstrate that stars in sub-samples above and below the period gap appear to arise from a stellar population not significantly contaminated by excess multiple systems. We also observe a small population of long-period variable M-dwarfs, which highlight a departure from the predictions made by rotational evolution models fitted to solar-type main-sequence objects. The NGTS data spans a period and spectral type range that links previous rotation studies such as those using data from Kepler, K2, and MEarth.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513..420B
The SN Ia runaway LP 398-9: detection of circumstellar material and surface rotation;;A promising progenitor scenario for Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa) is the thermonuclear detonation of a white dwarf in a close binary system with another white dwarf. After the primary star explodes, the surviving donor can be spontaneously released as a hypervelocity runaway. One such runaway donor candidate is LP 398-9, whose orbital trajectory traces back ≈10<SUP>5</SUP> yr to a known supernova remnant. Here, we report the discovery of carbon-rich circumstellar material around LP 398-9, revealed by a strong infrared excess and analysed with follow-up spectroscopy. The circumstellar material is most plausibly composed of inflated layers from the star itself, mechanically and radioactively heated by the past companion's supernova. We also detect a 15.4 h periodic signal in the UV and optical light curves of LP 398-9, which we interpret as surface rotation. The rotation rate is consistent with theoretical predictions from this supernova mechanism, and the brightness variations could originate from surface inhomogeneity deposited by the supernova itself. Our observations strengthen the case for this double-degenerate SNIa progenitor channel, and motivate the search for more runaway SNIa donors.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.6122C
A step towards unveiling the nature of three cataclysmic variables: LS Cam, V902 Mon, and SWIFT J0746.3-1608;;We have carried out detailed time-resolved timing analyses of three cataclysmic variables (CVs) namely LS Cam, V902 Mon, and SWIFT J0746.3-1608, using the long-baseline, high-cadence optical photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. Our analysis of LS Cam observations hints the presence of a superorbital period of ~4.025 ± 0.007 d along with negative and positive superhump periods of ~3.30 and 3.70 h, respectively. These results can be explained as an interaction of nodal and apsidal precession of the accretion disc with orbital motion. For the other two sources, V902 Mon and SWIFT J0746.3-1608, we have found evidence of a beat period of 2387.0 ± 0.6 and 2409.5 ± 0.7 s, respectively, which were not found in earlier studies. Our results presented in this study indicate the change in the accretion mode during the entire observing period for both sources. For V902 Mon, an apparent orbital period derivative of (6.09 ± 0.60) × 10<SUP>-10</SUP> was also found. Moreover, the second harmonic of orbital frequency dominates the power spectrum of SWIFT J0746.3-1608, suggestive of ellipsoidal modulation of the secondary star. Present analyses suggest that LS Cam could be a superhumping CV, whereas V902 Mon and SWIFT J0746.3-1608 are likely to be variable disc-overflow accreting intermediate polars.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.6054R
Unicorns and giraffes in the binary zoo: stripped giants with subgiant companions;;We analyse two binary systems containing giant stars, V723 Mon ('the Unicorn') and 2M04123153+6738486 ('the Giraffe'). Both giants orbit more massive but less luminous companions, previously proposed to be mass-gap black holes. Spectral disentangling reveals luminous companions with star-like spectra in both systems. Joint modelling of the spectra, light curves, and spectral energy distributions robustly constrains the masses, temperatures, and radii of both components: the primaries are luminous, cool giants ($T_{\rm eff,\, giant} = 3800$ and $4000\, \rm K$, $R_{\rm giant}= 22.5$ and $25\, {\rm R}_{\odot }$) with exceptionally low masses ($M_{\rm giant} \approx 0.4\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$) that likely fill their Roche lobes. The secondaries are only slightly warmer subgiants ($T_{\rm eff,\, 2} = 5800$ and $5150\, \rm K$, $R_2= 8.3$ and $9\, {\rm R}_{\odot }$) and thus are consistent with observed UV limits that would rule out main-sequence stars with similar masses ($M_2 \approx 2.8$ and ${\approx}1.8\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$). In the Unicorn, rapid rotation blurs the spectral lines of the subgiant, making it challenging to detect even at wavelengths where it dominates the total light. Both giants have surface abundances indicative of CNO processing and subsequent envelope stripping. The properties of both systems can be reproduced by binary evolution models in which a $1{-}2\, {\rm M}_{\odot }$ primary is stripped by a companion as it ascends the giant branch. The fact that the companions are also evolved implies either that the initial mass ratio was very near unity, or that the companions are temporarily inflated due to rapid accretion. The Unicorn and Giraffe offer a window into into a rarely observed phase of binary evolution preceding the formation of wide-orbit helium white dwarfs, and eventually, compact binaries containing two helium white dwarfs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.5620E
Discovery and characterization of five new eclipsing AM CVn systems;;AM CVn systems are ultra-compact, hydrogen-depleted, and helium-rich, accreting binaries with degenerate or semidegenerate donors. We report the discovery of five new eclipsing AM CVn systems with orbital periods of 61.5, 55.5, 53.3, 37.4, and 35.4 min. These systems were discovered by searching for deep eclipses in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) light curves of white dwarfs selected using Gaia parallaxes. We obtained phase-resolved spectroscopy to confirm that all systems are AM CVn binaries, and we obtained high-speed photometry to confirm the eclipse and characterize the systems. The spectra show double-peaked H e lines but also show metals, including K and Zn, elements that have never been detected in AM CVn systems before. By modelling the high-speed photometry, we measured the mass and radius of the donor star, potentially constraining the evolutionary channel that formed these AM CVn systems. We determined that the average mass of the accreting white dwarf is ≈0.8 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and that the white dwarfs in long-period systems are hotter than predicted by recently updated theoretical models. The donors have a high entropy and are a factor of ≈2 more massive compared to zero-entropy donors at the same orbital period. The large donor radius is most consistent with H e-star progenitors, although the observed spectral features seem to contradict this. The discovery of five new eclipsing AM CVn systems is consistent with the known observed AM CVn space density and estimated ZTF recovery efficiency.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.5440V
Cosmology intertwined: A review of the particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology associated with the cosmological tensions and anomalies;;The standard Λ Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model provides a good description of a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological data. However, there are a few big open questions that make the standard model look like an approximation to a more realistic scenario yet to be found. In this paper, we list a few important goals that need to be addressed in the next decade, taking into account the current discordances between the different cosmological probes, such as the disagreement in the value of the Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB>, the σ<SUB>8</SUB>-S<SUB>8</SUB> tension, and other less statistically significant anomalies. While these discordances can still be in part the result of systematic errors, their persistence after several years of accurate analysis strongly hints at cracks in the standard cosmological scenario and the necessity for new physics or generalisations beyond the standard model. In this paper, we focus on the 5.0 σ tension between the Planck CMB estimate of the Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB> and the SH0ES collaboration measurements. After showing the H<SUB>0</SUB> evaluations made from different teams using different methods and geometric calibrations, we list a few interesting new physics models that could alleviate this tension and discuss how the next decade's experiments will be crucial. Moreover, we focus on the tension of the Planck CMB data with weak lensing measurements and redshift surveys, about the value of the matter energy density Ω<SUB>m</SUB>, and the amplitude or rate of the growth of structure (σ<SUB>8</SUB> , fσ<SUB>8</SUB>). We list a few interesting models proposed for alleviating this tension, and we discuss the importance of trying to fit a full array of data with a single model and not just one parameter at a time. Additionally, we present a wide range of other less discussed anomalies at a statistical significance level lower than the H<SUB>0</SUB>-S<SUB>8</SUB> tensions which may also constitute hints towards new physics, and we discuss possible generic theoretical approaches that can collectively explain the non-standard nature of these signals. Finally, we give an overview of upgraded experiments and next-generation space missions and facilities on Earth that will be of crucial importance to address all these open questions.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JHEAp..34...49A
Revealing nature of GRB 210205A, ZTF21aaeyldq (AT2021any) and follow-up observations with the 4K×4K CCD imager + 3.6m DOT;;Optical follow-up observations of optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts are crucial to probe the geometry of outflows, emission mechanisms, energetics and burst environments. We performed the follow-up observations of GRB 210205A and ZTF21aaeyldq (AT2021any) using the 3.6m Devasthal optical telescope (DOT) around one day after the burst to deeper limits due to the longitudinal advantage of the place. This paper presents our analysis of the two objects using data from other collaborative facilities, i.e., 2.2m Calar Alto Astronomical Observatory (CAHA) and other archival data. Our analysis suggests that GRB 210205A is a potential dark burst once compared with the X-ray afterglow data. Also, comparing results with other known and well-studied dark GRBs samples indicate that the reason for the optical darkness of GRB 210205A could either be intrinsic faintness or a high redshift event. Based on our analysis, we also found that ZTF21aaeyldq is the third known orphan afterglow with a measured redshift except for ZTF20aajnksq (AT2020blt) and ZTF19abvizsw (AT2019pim). The multiwavelength afterglow modeling of ZTF21aaeyldq using the afterglowpy package demands a forward shock model for an ISM-like ambient medium with a rather wider jet opening angle. We determine circumburst density of n<SUB>0</SUB>=0.87 cm-<SUP>3</SUP>, kinetic energy E<SUB>k</SUB>=3.80 ×10<SUP>52</SUP> erg and the afterglow modeling also indicates that ZTF21aaeyldq is observed on-axis (θ<SUB>obs</SUB><θ<SUB>core</SUB> ) and a gamma-ray counterpart was missed by GRBs satellites. Our results emphasize that the 3.6m DOT has a unique capability for deep follow-up observations of similar and other new transients for deeper observations as a part of time-domain astronomy in the future.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JApA...43...11G
Optical flux and spectral characterization of the blazar PG 1553 + 113 based on the past 15 years of data;;We study flux and spectral variability of the high energy peaked TeV blazar PG 1553 + 113 on diverse timescales using the data collected from 2005 to 2019 which also includes the intensive intra-night monitoring of the target. Additionally, we recorded the brightest flare of the blazar PG 1553 + 113 during April 2019 when the source attained an R-band magnitude of 13.2. Analyzing the spectral evolution of the source during the flare gave a clockwise spectral hysteresis loop and a time lag with V-band variations leading to the R-band ones. Various statistical tests, fitting procedures and cross-correlation techniques are applied to search for periodicity and examine the color-magnitude relationship. We find a median period of (2.21 ± 0.04) years along with the secondary period of about 210 days. Finally, we briefly discuss various physical mechanisms which are capable of explaining our findings.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JApA...43....9A
Influence of Tectonic Factor on Porphyry Copper Deposits Localization and Distribution (Arasbaran District, NW Iran): Synthesis of Alteration Patterns and Lineaments Using Digital Techniques;;The Kighal and Bormolk porphyry copper deposits (PCDs) are known subeconomic deposits and are ~10 km south of Sungun, the world-class copper mine in NW Iran. The deposits are located in the Azerbaijan plateau, within Alborz, Zagros, and Caucasus Mountain ranges, having undergone active tectonics, including uplift and thrust-folding from the Cimmerrian Orogeny. The sub-economic nature of the Kighal and Bormolk deposits, despite their relatively close distance and age and lithologic similarity to those of the Sungun deposit, has been discussed. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery were used to map alteration patterns and lineaments associated with these deposits. In order to discriminate alteration minerals of the deposits in comparison with those in the Sungun deposit, the ASTER image was processed using False Color Composite (FCC), Band Ratio (BR), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF), and Mixture-Tuned Matched-Filtering (MTMF) techniques, which recognize seven alteration types in the Kighal−Bormolk area and three types in the Sungun area, including its more intense alteration systems. The results were verified by field observations, mineralogical, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. Also, lineament extraction of DEM and Landsat 8 OLI data by Envi 5.1, Geomatica, ArcGIS 10.6, and Rockworks 16, displayed a lower density of fault intersections in the Kighal−Bormolk area. Additionally, NW−SE trending lineaments of the Sungun deposit, which is in accordance with most of the valuable porphyry copper deposits in Iran, are taken into account.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Geote..56..382R
Compact Binary Coalescences: Astrophysical Processes and Lessons Learned;;On 11 February 2016, the LIGO and Virgo scientific collaborations announced the first direct detection of gravitational waves, a signal caught by the LIGO interferometers on 14 September 2015, and produced by the coalescence of two stellar-mass black holes. The discovery represented the beginning of an entirely new way to investigate the Universe. The latest gravitational-wave catalog by LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA brings the total number of gravitational-wave events to 90, and the count is expected to significantly increase in the next years, when additional ground-based and space-born interferometers will be operational. From the theoretical point of view, we have only fuzzy ideas about where the detected events came from, and the answers to most of the five Ws and How for the astrophysics of compact binary coalescences are still unknown. In this work, we review our current knowledge and uncertainties on the astrophysical processes behind merging compact-object binaries. Furthermore, we discuss the astrophysical lessons learned through the latest gravitational-wave detections, paying specific attention to the theoretical challenges coming from exceptional events (e.g., GW190521 and GW190814).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Galax..10...76S
A pure hadronic model description of the observed neutrino emission from the tidal disruption event AT2019dsg;;Recently, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has detected the neutrino event IceCube-170922A from the radio-emitting tidal disruption event (TDE) named AT2019dsg, indicating to be one of the most likely sources of high-energy cosmic rays. So far, the photo-hadronic interaction is considered in the literature to interpret neutrino emission from AT2019dsg. Here, we examine whether the IceCube-170922A along with the broadband electromagnetic emission from the source can also be described by a pure hadronic emission employing the proton blazar inspired (PBI) model, which takes into account the non-relativistic protons that emerge under the charge neutrality situation of the blazar jet and thus offers sufficient target matter for pp interactions with shock-accelerated protons. Our findings show that the PBI model is able to consistently describe the IceCube observations on AT2019dsg and the broadband spectrum of the source without exceeding the observed X-ray and gamma-ray flux upper limits imposed by the XMM-Newton and Fermi-LAT telescopes.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022EPJC...82..517B
The OGLE Collection of Variable Stars: Nearly 66,000 Mira Stars in the Milky Way;;We present a collection of 65,981 Mira-type variable stars found in the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) project database. Two-thirds of our sample (40,356 objects) are located in the Galactic bulge fields, whereas 25,625 stars are in the Galactic disk. The vast majority of the collection (47,532 objects) comprises new discoveries. We provide basic observational parameters of the Mira variables: equatorial coordinates, pulsation periods, I-band and V-band mean magnitudes, I-band brightness amplitudes, and identifications in other catalogs of variable stars. We also provide the I-band and V-band time-series photometry collected since 1997 during the OGLE-II, OGLE-III, and OGLE-IV phases. The classical selection process, i.e., being mostly based on the visual inspection of light curves by experienced astronomers, has led to the high purity of the catalog. As a result, this collection can be used as a training set for machine-learning classification algorithms. Using overlapping areas of adjacent OGLE fields, we estimate the completeness of the catalog to be about 96%. We compare and discuss the statistical features of Miras located in different regions of the Milky Way. We show examples of stars that change their type over time, from a semiregular variable to Mira and vice versa. This data set is perfectly suited to studying the three-dimensional structure of the Milky Way, and it may help to explain the puzzle of the X-shaped bulge.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..260...46I
GB6 J2113+1121: A Multiwavelength Flaring γ-Ray Blazar Temporally and Spatially Coincident with the Neutrino Event IceCube-191001A;;A radio-emitting tidal disruption event (AT2019dsg) is proposed as a likely counterpart to the IceCube neutrino event IC 191001A. In this work, we have revisited the Fermi-LAT data in the direction of the neutrino and confirmed no signal at the site of AT2019dsg. Instead, at the edge of the 90% confidence level error region of this neutrino, there is a γ-ray transient source associated with the blazar GB6 J2113+1121. In 2019 May, GB6 J2113+1121 was undergoing a γ-ray flare that is unprecedented since the start of the Fermi-LAT operation, with a variability amplitude of about 20 fold. Similar violent flares of GB6 J2113+1121, unobserved before, have also been detected in the optical bands. Moreover, the blazar remained in a high-flux state in the infrared bands when IC 191001A arrived, though the blazar 's γ-ray and optical activities have temporarily ceased. Motivated by this spatial and temporal coincidence, we suggest that GB6 J2113+1121 is a candidate to be the counterpart to IC 191001A. The jet properties of GB6 J2113+1121 are investigated, which are found to be comparable with that of neutrino-emitting blazars (candidates). A specific analysis of archival IceCube data in this direction and future observations would put further constraints on the origin of the neutrino.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...932L..25L
Optical Light Curve of 4FGL J0935.3+0901: A Flaring Black Widow Candidate;;I obtained time-series photometry of the compact binary candidate for the Fermi source 4FGL J0935.3+0901. Superposed on the 2.44 hr orbital modulation are day-to-day variations and frequent flaring as seen in several redback and black widow millisecond pulsars (MSPs). The short orbital period favors a black widow. While the modulation of ≤1 mag is smaller than that of most black widows, it could indicate a low orbital inclination. Although a published optical spectrum shows strong emission lines, the light curve evinces pulsar heating of the companion star rather than accretion-disk emission of a transitional MSP. Emission lines and flaring occur in the same objects, probably powered by shocks between the relativistic pulsar wind and a wind driven off the companion star. I also recovered the period in photometry from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). A phase-connected ephemeris derived from MDM Observatory and ZTF data spanning 4 yr yields a period of 0.10153276(36) days and an epoch for the ascending node of the putative pulsar.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...932L...8H
The Large Superfast Rotators Discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility;;Two high-cadence surveys aiming for rotation period measurements of asteroids have been conducted in 2019 January and October using the Zwicky Transient Facility. From the surveys, 25 large superfast rotators (SFRs) were discovered and they are all main-belt asteroids (MBAs), except for one Mars crosser. These large SFRs have a diameter ranging from 0.43 to 7.87 km and a rotation period between 0.48 and 1.95 hr. Considering their diameters and fast rotations, they cannot be explained by rubble-pile structure unless using extraordinary high bulk densities. Cohesion, if available, can conserve these large SFRs. The estimated cohesion for these large SFRs could be up to thousands of pascals, much higher than the currently estimated cohesion for asteroids and that generated by the regolith of Moon and Mars. Such high-level cohesion can be produced from fine-grain regolith, like clay. However, the availability of such fine-grain regolith for asteroids is still unknown. Although the possibility of these large SFRs being large monolithic objects cannot be ruled out, this scenario is very unlikely given that the timescale of disruptive impact for MBAs in a similar diameter range is 10<SUP>7</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> yr.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...932L...5C
A Speed Bump: SN 2021aefx Shows that Doppler Shift Alone Can Explain Early Excess Blue Flux in Some Type Ia Supernovae;;We present early-time photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2021aefx. The early-time u-band light curve shows an excess flux when compared to normal SNe Ia. We suggest that the early excess blue flux may be due to a rapid change in spectral velocity in the first few days post explosion, produced by the emission of the Ca II H&K feature passing from the u to the B bands on the timescale of a few days. This effect could be dominant for all SNe Ia that have broad absorption features and early-time velocities over 25,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. It is likely to be one of the main causes of early excess u-band flux in SNe Ia that have early-time high velocities. This effect may also be dominant in the UV filters, as well as in places where the SN spectral energy distribution is quickly rising to longer wavelengths. The rapid change in velocity can only produce a monotonic change (in flux-space) in the u band. For objects that explode at lower velocities, and have a more structured shape in the early excess emission, there must also be an additional parameter producing the early-time diversity. More early-time observations, in particular early spectra, are required to determine how prominent this effect is within SNe Ia.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...932L...2A
Searching for Anomalies in the ZTF Catalog of Periodic Variable Stars;;Periodic variables illuminate the physical processes of stars throughout their lifetime. Wide-field surveys continue to increase our discovery rates of periodic variable stars. Automated approaches are essential to identify interesting periodic variable stars for multiwavelength and spectroscopic follow-up. Here we present a novel unsupervised machine-learning approach to hunt for anomalous periodic variables using phase-folded light curves presented in the Zwicky Transient Facility Catalogue of Periodic Variable Stars by Chen et al. We use a convolutional variational autoencoder to learn a low-dimensional latent representation, and we search for anomalies within this latent dimension via an isolation forest. We identify anomalies with irregular variability. Most of the top anomalies are likely highly variable red giants or asymptotic giant branch stars concentrated in the Milky Way galactic disk; a fraction of the identified anomalies are more consistent with young stellar objects. Detailed spectroscopic follow-up observations are encouraged to reveal the nature of these anomalies.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...932..118C
Luminous Millimeter, Radio, and X-Ray Emission from ZTF 20acigmel (AT 2020xnd);;Observations of the extragalactic (z = 0.0141) transient AT 2018cow established a new class of energetic explosions shocking a dense medium, producing luminous emission at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths. Here we present detailed millimeter- through centimeter-wave observations of a similar transient, ZTF 20acigmel (AT 2020xnd), at z = 0.2433. Using observations from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array and the Very Large Array, we model the unusual millimeter and radio emission from AT 2020xnd under several different assumptions and ultimately favor synchrotron radiation from a thermal electron population (relativistic Maxwellian). The thermal electron model implies a fast but subrelativistic (v ≈ 0.3c) shock and a high ambient density (n <SUB> e </SUB> ≈ 4 × 10<SUP>3</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) at Δt ≈ 40 days. The X-ray luminosity of L <SUB> X </SUB> ≈ 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> exceeds simple predictions from the radio and UVOIR luminosity and likely has a separate physical origin, such as a central engine. Using the fact that month-long luminous (L <SUB> ν </SUB> ≈ 2 × 10<SUP>30</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> Hz<SUP>-1</SUP> at 100 GHz) millimeter emission appears to be a generic feature of transients with fast (t <SUB>1/2</SUB> ≈ 3 days) and luminous (M <SUB>peak</SUB> ≈ -21 mag) optical light curves, we estimate the rate at which transients like AT 2018cow and AT 2020xnd will be detected by future wide-field millimeter transient surveys such as CMB-S4 and conclude that energetic explosions in dense environments may represent a significant population of extragalactic transients in the 100 GHz sky.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...932..116H
The Circumstellar Environments of Double-peaked, Calcium-strong Transients 2021gno and 2021inl;;We present panchromatic observations and modeling of calcium-strong supernovae (SNe) 2021gno in the star-forming host-galaxy NGC 4165 and 2021inl in the outskirts of elliptical galaxy NGC 4923, both monitored through the Young Supernova Experiment transient survey. The light curves of both, SNe show two peaks, the former peak being derived from shock cooling emission (SCE) and/or shock interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). The primary peak in SN 2021gno is coincident with luminous, rapidly decaying X-ray emission (L <SUB> x </SUB> = 5 × 10<SUP>41</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) detected by Swift-XRT at δ t = 1 day after explosion, this observation being the second-ever detection of X-rays from a calcium-strong transient. We interpret the X-ray emission in the context of shock interaction with CSM that extends to r < 3 × 10<SUP>14</SUP> cm. Based on X-ray modeling, we calculate a CSM mass M <SUB>CSM</SUB> = (0.3-1.6) × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> and density n = (1-4) × 10<SUP>10</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. Radio nondetections indicate a low-density environment at larger radii (r > 10<SUP>16</SUP> cm) and mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} {10}^{-4}$ M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. SCE modeling of both primary light-curve peaks indicates an extended-progenitor envelope mass M <SUB> e </SUB> = 0.02-0.05 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> and radius R <SUB> e </SUB> = 30-230 R <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The explosion properties suggest progenitor systems containing either a low-mass massive star or a white dwarf (WD), the former being unlikely given the lack of local star formation. Furthermore, the environments of both SNe are consistent with low-mass hybrid He/C/O WD + C/O WD mergers.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...932...58J
NICER Monitoring of Supersoft X-Ray Sources;;We monitored four supersoft sources-two persistent ones, CAL 83 and MR Vel, and the recent novae YZ Ret (Nova Ret 2020), and V1674 Her (Nova Her 2021)-with NICER. The two persistent supersoft X-ray sources (SSS) were observed with unvaried X-ray flux level and spectrum, respectively, 13 and 20 yr after the last observations. Short-period modulations of the SSS appear where the spectrum of the luminous central source was fully visible (in CAL 83 and V1674 Her) and were absent in YZ Ret and MR Vel, in which the flux originated in photoionized or shocked plasma, while the white dwarf (WD) was not observable. We thus suggest that the pulsations occur on, or very close to, the WD surface. The pulsations of CAL 83 were almost unvaried after 15 yr, including an irregular drift of the ≃67 s period by 2.1 s. Simulations, including previous XMM-Newton data, indicate actual variations in period length within hours, rather than an artifact of the variable amplitude of the pulsations. Large amplitude pulsations with a period of 501.53 ± 0.30 s were always detected in V1674 Her, as long as the SSS was observable. This period seems to be due to rotation of a highly magnetized WD. We cannot confirm the maximum effective temperature of (≃145,000 K) previously inferred for this nova, and discuss the difficulty in interpreting its spectrum. The WD appears to present two surface zones, one of which does not emit SSS flux.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...932...45O
In Search of Short Gamma-Ray Burst Optical Counterparts with the Zwicky Transient Facility;;The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggers on-board in response to ~40 short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) per year; however, their large localization regions have made the search for optical counterparts a challenging endeavour. We have developed and executed an extensive program with the wide field of view of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) camera, mounted on the Palomar 48 inch Oschin telescope (P48), to perform target-of-opportunity (ToO) observations on 10 Fermi-GBM SGRBs during 2018 and 2020-2021. Bridging the large sky areas with small field-of-view optical telescopes in order to track the evolution of potential candidates, we look for the elusive SGRB afterglows and kilonovae (KNe) associated with these high-energy events. No counterpart has yet been found, even though more than 10 ground-based telescopes, part of the Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) network, have taken part in these efforts. The candidate selection procedure and the follow-up strategy have shown that ZTF is an efficient instrument for searching for poorly localized SGRBs, retrieving a reasonable number of candidates to follow up and showing promising capabilities as the community approaches the multi-messenger era. Based on the median limiting magnitude of ZTF, our searches would have been able to retrieve a GW170817-like event up to ~200 Mpc and SGRB afterglows to z = 0.16 or 0.4, depending on the assumed underlying energy model. Future ToOs will expand the horizon to z = 0.2 and 0.7, respectively.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...932...40A
The Peculiar Short-duration GRB 200826A and Its Supernova;;Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are classified into long and short events. Long GRBs (LGRBs) are associated with the end states of very massive stars, while short GRBs (SGRBs) are linked to the merger of compact objects. GRB 200826A was a peculiar event, because by definition it was an SGRB, with a rest-frame duration of ~0.5 s. However, this event was energetic and soft, which is consistent with LGRBs. The relatively low redshift (z = 0.7486) motivated a comprehensive, multiwavelength follow-up campaign to characterize its host, search for a possible associated supernova (SN), and thus understand the origin of this burst. To this aim we obtained a combination of deep near-infrared (NIR) and optical imaging together with spectroscopy. Our analysis reveals an optical and NIR bump in the light curve whose luminosity and evolution are in agreement with several SNe associated to LGRBs. Analysis of the prompt GRB shows that this event follows the E <SUB>p,i</SUB>-E <SUB>iso</SUB> relation found for LGRBs. The host galaxy is a low-mass star-forming galaxy, typical of LGRBs, but with one of the highest star formation rates, especially with respect to its mass ( $\mathrm{log}{M}_{* }/{M}_{\odot }=8.6$ , SFR ~ 4.0 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>). We conclude that GRB 200826A is a typical collapsar event in the low tail of the duration distribution of LGRBs. These findings support theoretical predictions that events produced by collapsars can be as short as 0.5 s in the host frame and further confirm that duration alone is not an efficient discriminator for the progenitor class of a GRB. <SUP>*</SUP> Based on data obtained with the LBT programs: LBT-2019B-18 (PI A.

TOI-1696: A Nearby M4 Dwarf with a 3 R <SUB>⊕</SUB> Planet in the Neptunian Desert;;We present the discovery and validation of a temperate sub-Neptune around the nearby mid-M dwarf TIC 470381900 (TOI-1696), with a radius of 3.09 ± 0.11 R <SUB>⊕</SUB> and an orbital period of 2.5 days, using a combination of Transiting Exoplanets Survey Satellite (TESS) and follow-up observations using ground-based telescopes. Joint analysis of multiband photometry from TESS, Multicolor Simultaneous Camera for studying Atmospheres of Transiting exoplanets (MuSCAT), MuSCAT3, Sinistro, and KeplerCam confirmed the transit signal to be achromatic as well as refined the orbital ephemeris. High-resolution imaging with Gemini/'Alopeke and high-resolution spectroscopy with the Subaru InfraRed Doppler (IRD) confirmed that there are no stellar companions or background sources to the star. The spectroscopic observations with IRD and Infrared Telescope Facility SpeX were used to determine the stellar parameters, and it was found that the host star is an M4 dwarf with an effective temperature of T <SUB>eff</SUB> = 3185 ± 76 K and a metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.336 ± 0.060 dex. The radial velocities measured from IRD set a 2σ upper limit on the planetary mass to be 48.8 M <SUB>⊕</SUB>. The large radius ratio (R <SUB>p</SUB>/R <SUB>⋆</SUB> ~ 0.1) and the relatively bright near-infrared magnitude (J = 12.2 mag) make this planet an attractive target for further follow-up observations. TOI-1696 b is one of the planets belonging to the Neptunian desert with the highest transmission spectroscopy metric discovered to date, making it an interesting candidate for atmospheric characterizations with JWST.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..298M
TOI-1696 and TOI-2136: Constraining the Masses of Two Mini-Neptunes with the Habitable-Zone Planet Finder;;We present the validation of two planets orbiting M dwarfs, TOI-1696b and TOI-2136b. Both planets are mini-Neptunes orbiting nearby stars, making them promising prospects for atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We validated the planetary nature of both candidates using high-contrast imaging, ground-based photometry, and near-infrared radial velocities. Adaptive optics images were taken using the ShARCS camera on the 3 m Shane Telescope. Speckle images were taken using the NN-Explore Exoplanet Stellar Speckle Imager on the WIYN 3.5 m telescope. Radii and orbital ephemerides were refined using a combination of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, the diffuser-assisted Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) Telescope Imaging Camera (ARCTIC) imager on the 3.5 m ARC telescope at Apache Point Observatory, and the 0.6 m telescope at Red Buttes Observatory. We obtained radial velocities using the Habitable-Zone Planet Finder on the 10 m Hobby-Eberly Telescope, which enabled us to place upper limits on the masses of both transiting planets. TOI-1696b (P = 2.5 days; R <SUB> p </SUB> = 3.24 R <SUB>⊕</SUB>; M <SUB> p </SUB> < 56.6 M <SUB>⊕</SUB>) falls into a sparsely populated region of parameter space considering its host star's temperature (T <SUB>eff</SUB> = 3168 K, M4.5), as planets of its size are quite rare around mid- to late-M dwarfs. On the other hand, TOI-2136b (P = 7.85 days; R <SUB> p </SUB> = 2.09 R <SUB>⊕</SUB>; M <SUB> p </SUB> < 15.0 M <SUB>⊕</SUB>) is an excellent candidate for atmospheric follow-up with the JWST.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..286B
A Young, Low-density Stellar Stream in the Milky Way Disk: Theia 456;;Our view of the variety of stellar structures pervading the local Milky Way has been transformed by the application of clustering algorithms to the Gaia catalog. In particular, several stellar streams have been recently discovered that are comprised of hundreds to thousands of stars and span several hundred parsecs. We analyze one such structure, Theia 456, a low-density stellar stream extending nearly 200 pc and 20° across the sky. By supplementing Gaia astrometric data with spectroscopic metallicities from Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope and photometric rotation periods from the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we establish Theia 456's radial velocity coherence, and we find strong evidence that members of Theia 456 have a common age (≃175 Myr), common dynamical origin, and formed from chemically homogeneous prestellar material ([Fe/H] = -0.07 dex). Unlike well-known stellar streams in the Milky Way, which are in its halo, Theia 456 is firmly part of the thin disk. If our conclusions about Theia 456 can be applied to even a small fraction of the remaining ≃8300 independent structures in the Theia catalog, such low-density stellar streams may be ubiquitous. We comment on the implications this has for the nature of star formation throughout the Galaxy.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..275A
A Zwicky Transient Facility Look at Optical Variability of Young Stellar Objects in the North America and Pelican Nebulae Complex;;We present a study of 323 photometrically variable young stellar objects that are likely members of the North America and Pelican nebulae star-forming region. To do so, we utilize over two years of data in the g and r photometric bands from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We first investigate periodic variability, finding 46 objects (~15% of the sample) with significant periods that phase well and can be attributed to stellar rotation. We then use the quasiperiodicity (Q) and flux asymmetry (M) variability metrics to assign morphological classifications to the remaining aperiodic light curves. Another ~39% of the variable star sample beyond the periodic (low Q) sources are also flux-symmetric, but with a quasiperiodic (moderate Q) or stochastic (high Q) nature. Concerning flux-asymmetric sources, our analysis reveals ~14% bursters (high negative M) and ~29% dippers (high positive M). We also investigate the relationship between variability slopes in the g versus g - r color-magnitude diagram, and the light-curve morphological classes. Burster-type objects have shallow slopes, while dipper-type variables tend to have higher slopes that are consistent with extinction-driven variability. Our work is one of the earliest applications of the Q and M metrics to ground-based data. We therefore contrast the Q values of high-cadence and high-precision space-based data, for which these metrics were designed, with Q determinations resulting from degraded space-based light curves that have the cadence and photometric precision characteristic of ground-based data.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..263H
Activity and Rotation of Nearby Field M Dwarfs in the TESS Southern Continuous Viewing Zone;;The evolution of magnetism in late-type dwarfs remains murky, as we can only weakly predict levels of activity for M dwarfs of a given mass and age. We report results from our spectroscopic survey of M dwarfs in the Southern Continuous Viewing Zone (CVZ) of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). As the TESS CVZs overlap with those of the James Webb Space Telescope, our targets constitute a legacy sample for studies of nearby M dwarfs. For 122 stars, we obtained at least one R ≈ 2000 optical spectrum with which we measure chromospheric Hα emission, a proxy for magnetic field strength. The fraction of active stars is consistent with what is expected for field M dwarfs; as in previous studies, we find that late-type M dwarfs remain active for longer than their early-type counterparts. While the TESS light curves for ≈20% of our targets show modulations consistent with rotation, TESS systematics are not well enough understood for confident measurements of rotation periods (P <SUB>rot</SUB>) longer than half the length of an observing sector. We report periods for 12 stars for which we measure P <SUB>rot</SUB> ≲ 15 days or find confirmation for the TESS-derived P <SUB>rot</SUB> in the literature. Our sample of 21 P <SUB>rot</SUB>, which includes periods from the literature, is consistent with our targets being spun-down field stars. Finally, we examine the Hα-to-bolometric luminosity distribution for our sample. Two stars are rotating fast enough to be magnetically saturated, but are not, hinting at the possibility that fast rotators may appear inactive in Hα.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..257A
Magnetic Activity on Four Short-period Contact Binaries: V0576 Peg, KW Psc, V0873 Per, and FY Boo;;We presented new photometry for four short-period late-type binaries, observed by three small telescopes in China from 2020 September to 2021 December. Seven sets of light curves (including the TESS data for FY Boo) were analyzed by using the W-D method. Three binaries (V0576 Peg, V0873 Per, and FY Boo) are W-type binaries with q ≃ 2.5, while KW Psc is an A-type binary with q ≃ 0.43. Max.I-Max.II is up to 10% of variable light amplitude for the asymmetric light curves, which are modeled by a dark spot on the surface of the more massive component. Photometric results imply the existence of movement and evolution of the cool spot. From the temperature-luminosity and mass-luminosity diagrams, the more massive components are a bit evolved main-sequence stars, while the less massive ones are oversized and overluminous owing to energy exchange. Orbital period analyses indicate that the cyclic oscillations occur in the (O - C) curves. Their modulated periods approach 11 yr, which may preferably result from the magnetic activity cycle for four late-type contact binaries. With angular momentum loss through magnetic braking, these short-period contact binaries may evolve into deep-contact configurations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..250Y
Hitting a New Low: The Unique 28 hr Cessation of Accretion in the TESS Light Curve of YY Dra (DO Dra);;We present the Transiting Exoplanet Surveying Satellite light curve of the intermediate polar YY Draconis (YY Dra, also known as DO Dra). The power spectrum indicates that while there is stream-fed accretion for most of the observational period, there is a day-long, flat-bottomed low state at the beginning of 2020 during which the only periodic signal is ellipsoidal variation and there is no appreciable flickering. We interpret this low state to be a complete cessation of accretion, a phenomenon that has been observed only once before in an intermediate polar. Simultaneous ground-based observations of this faint state establish that when accretion is negligible, YY Dra fades to g = 17.37 ± 0.12, which we infer to be the magnitude of the combined photospheric contributions of the white dwarf and its red dwarf companion. Using survey photometry, we identify additional low states in 2018-2019 during which YY Dra repeatedly fades to-but never below-this threshold. This implies relatively frequent cessations in accretion. Spectroscopic observations during future episodes of negligible accretion can be used to directly measure the field strength of the white dwarf by Zeeman splitting. Separately, we search newly available catalogs of variable stars in an attempt to resolve the long-standing dispute over the proper identifier of this system.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..246H
XMM-Newton and TESS observations of the highly variable polar V496 UMa;;
 Aims: We studied the temporal and spectral behavior of V496 UMa from the optical to the X-ray regimes. 
 Methods: We used archival XMM-Newton and TESS observations obtained in 2017 and 2019, respectively, to perform a spectral and timing analysis of the highly variable magnetic CV. 
 Results: The light curves of the TESS and XMM-Newton satellites reveal a double-humped pattern modulated with the periodicity of 91.058467 ± 0.00001 min. V496 UMa displays a two-pole accretion geometry in the high accretion state. X-ray spectra from these regions are composed of thermal plasma radiation and soft blackbody components with almost identical temperatures and a total accretion rate of Ṁ = 1.4(8) × 10<SUP>−11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>−1</SUP>. The X-ray centers of the humps show longitudinal shifts of −18° and 4°, and shifts around photometric phase zero of −172° and −186°, for the main hump and second hump, respectively. The long-term ZTF light curves reveal high and low accretions states. Low-state ZTF and SDSS photometric data are consistent with an 0.8 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> white dwarf at 10 000 K and a main-sequence donor star with a spectral type of M5.0 at a Gaia determined distance of 758 pc. 
 Conclusions: V496 UMa is a very bright polar in X-rays when it is in the high state. Due to its unusual geometric structure, mass accretion onto the second accretion pole is interrupted occasionally. This discontinuous behavior does not follow a certain pattern in time and has been observed so far only in the high state. The X-ray light curves display clear evidence of an accretion stream at the photometric phase of ϕ = 0.81, which does not show up in optical light curves. An accurate period was derived using the combined TESS and XMM-Newton data, which differs by 3.8σ from published results.

AutoSourceID-Light. Fast optical source localization via U-Net and Laplacian of Gaussian;;
 Aims: With the ever-increasing survey speed of optical wide-field telescopes and the importance of discovering transients when they are still young, rapid and reliable source localization is paramount. We present AutoSourceID-Light (ASID-L), an innovative framework that uses computer vision techniques that can naturally deal with large amounts of data and rapidly localize sources in optical images. 
 Methods: We show that the ASID-L algorithm based on U-shaped networks and enhanced with a Laplacian of Gaussian filter provides outstanding performance in the localization of sources. A U-Net network discerns the sources in the images from many different artifacts and passes the result to a Laplacian of Gaussian filter that then estimates the exact location. 
 Results: Using ASID-L on the optical images of the MeerLICHT telescope demonstrates the great speed and localization power of the method. We compare the results with SExtractor and show that our method outperforms this more widely used method. ASID-L rapidly detects more sources not only in low- and mid-density fields, but particularly in areas with more than 150 sources per square arcminute. The training set and code used in this paper are publicly available.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...662A.109S
The population of hot subdwarf stars studied with Gaia. IV. Catalogues of hot subluminous stars based on Gaia EDR3;;In light of substantial new discoveries of hot subdwarfs by ongoing spectroscopic surveys and the availability of the Gaia mission Early Data Release 3 (EDR3), we compiled new releases of two catalogues of hot subluminous stars: The data release 3 (DR3) catalogue of the known hot subdwarf stars contains 6616 unique sources and provides multi-band photometry, and astrometry from Gaia EDR3 as well as classifications based on spectroscopy and colours. This is an increase of 742 objects over the DR2 catalogue. This new catalogue provides atmospheric parameters for 3087 stars and radial velocities for 2791 stars from the literature. In addition, we have updated the Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) catalogue of hot subluminous stars using the improved accuracy of the Gaia EDR3 data set together with updated quality and selection criteria to produce the Gaia EDR3 catalogue of 61 585 hot subluminous stars, representing an increase of 21 785 objects. The improvements in Gaia EDR3 astrometry and photometry compared to Gaia DR2 have enabled us to define more sophisticated selection functions. In particular, we improved hot subluminous star detection in the crowded regions of the Galactic plane as well as in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds by including sources with close apparent neighbours but with flux levels that dominate the neighbourhood.

Infrared Spectral Energy Distribution and Variability of Active Galactic Nuclei: Clues to the Structure of Circumnuclear Material;;The active galactic nucleus (AGN) phenomenon results from a supermassive black hole accreting its surrounding gaseous and dusty material. The infrared (IR) regime provides most of the information to characterize the dusty structures that bridge from the galaxy to the black hole, providing clues to the black hole growth and host galaxy evolution. Over the past several decades, with the commissioning of various ground, airborne and space IR observing facilities, our interpretations of the AGN circumnuclear structures have advanced significantly through an improved understanding of how their dust emission changes as a function of wavelength and how the heating of the dusty structures responds to variations in the energy released from the central engine. In this review, we summarize the current observational knowledge of the AGN IR broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and the IR time variability behavior covering large ranges of AGN luminosity and redshift, and discuss some first-order insights into the obscuring structures and host galaxy IR properties that can be obtained by integrating the relevant observations into a coherent picture.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Univ....8..304L
Antarctic Survey Telescope 3-3: Overview, System Performance and Preliminary Observations at Yaoan, Yunnan;;The third Antarctic Survey Telescope array instrument at Dome A in Antarctica, the AST3-3 telescope, has been in commissioning from March 2021. We deployed AST3-3 at the Yaoan astronomical station in Yunnan Province for an automatic time-domain survey and follow-up observations with an optimised observation and protection system. The telescope system of AST3-3 is similar to that of AST3-1 and AST3-2, except that it is equipped with a 14 K × 10 K QHY411 CMOS camera. AST3-3 has a field of view of 1.65∘×1.23∘ and is currently using the g band filter. During commissioning at Yaoan, AST3-3 aims to conduct an extragalactic transient survey, coupled with prompt follow-ups of opportunity targets. In this paper, we present the architecture of the AST3-3 automatic observation system. We demonstrate the data processing of observations by representatives SN 2022eyw and GRB 210420B.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Univ....8..303S
Detecting and Monitoring Tidal Dissipation of Hot Jupiters in the Era of SiTian;;Transit Timing Variation (TTV) of hot Jupiters provides direct observational evidence of planet tidal dissipation. Detecting tidal dissipation through TTV needs high precision transit timings and long timing baselines. In this work, we predict and discuss the potential scientific contribution of the SiTian Survey in detecting and analyzing exoplanet TTV. We develop a tidal dissipation detection pipeline for the SiTian Survey that aims at time-domain astronomy with 72 1 m optical telescopes. The pipeline includes the modules of light curve deblending, transit timing acquisition and TTV modeling. SiTian is capable of detecting more than 25,000 exoplanets among which we expect ~50 sources to show evidence of tidal dissipation. We present detection and analysis of tidal dissipating targets, based on simulated SiTian light curves of XO-3b and WASP-161b. The transit light curve modeling gives consistent results within 1σ to input values of simulated light curves. Also, the parameter uncertainties predicted by Markov Chain Monte Carlo are consistent with the distribution obtained from simulating and modeling the light curve 1000 times. The timing precision of SiTian observations is ~0.5 minutes with one transit visit. We show that differences between TTV origins, e.g., tidal dissipation, apsidal precession and multiple planets, would be significant, considering the timing precision and baseline. The detection rate of tidal dissipating hot Jupiters would answer a crucial question of whether the planet migrates at an early formation stage or random stages due to perturbations, e.g., planet scattering or secular interaction. SiTian identified targets would be constructive given that the sample would extend tenfold.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022RAA....22e5005Y
Apophis Planetary Defense Campaign;;We describe results of a planetary defense exercise conducted during the close approach to Earth by the near-Earth asteroid (99942) Apophis during 2020 December-2021 March. The planetary defense community has been conducting observational campaigns since 2017 to test the operational readiness of the global planetary defense capabilities. These community-led global exercises were carried out with the support of NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office and the International Asteroid Warning Network. The Apophis campaign is the third in our series of planetary defense exercises. The goal of this campaign was to recover, track, and characterize Apophis as a potential impactor to exercise the planetary defense system including observations, hypothetical risk assessment and risk prediction, and hazard communication. Based on the campaign results, we present lessons learned about our ability to observe and model a potential impactor. Data products derived from astrometric observations were available for inclusion in our risk assessment model almost immediately, allowing real-time updates to the impact probability calculation and possible impact locations. An early NEOWISE diameter measurement provided a significant improvement in the uncertainty on the range of hypothetical impact outcomes. The availability of different characterization methods such as photometry, spectroscopy, and radar provided robustness to our ability to assess the potential impact risk.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PSJ.....3..123R
New Semiregular Variable Star Near The Wizard Nebula - Evolution of the Red Giant MACOMP_V1;;The red giant MaCoMP_V1 in Cepheus at coordinates RA (J2000) 22:49:05:49 and DEC (J2000) +57:52:41:6 is a semiregular variable star classified as SRS, number 2225960 in the AAVSO VSX database. Using the Fourier transform, the period P = 24.751(0.062)d was evaluated and, with the support of the ASAS-SN and ZTF surveys, a well-defined light curve was made. The analysis resulted in the fundamental physical parameters of MaCoMP_V1, such as the mass M = 4.97(0.38)M(Sun) and radius R = 40.5(6.7)R(Sun), with consistent values suggesting the characteristics of a semiregular red giant. In addition, the effective temperature Teff = 4500(135)K from the Gaia catalog and the stellar evolution based on the Schoenberg-Chandraskehar limit was estimated.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022OEJV..229....1C

A 62-minute orbital period black widow binary in a wide hierarchical triple;;Over a dozen millisecond pulsars are ablating low-mass companions in close binary systems. In the original `black widow', the eight-hour orbital period eclipsing pulsar PSR J1959+2048 (PSR B1957+20)<SUP>1</SUP>, high-energy emission originating from the pulsar<SUP>2</SUP> is irradiating and may eventually destroy<SUP>3</SUP> a low-mass companion. These systems are not only physical laboratories that reveal the interesting results of exposing a close companion star to the relativistic energy output of a pulsar, but are also believed to harbour some of the most massive neutron stars<SUP>4</SUP>, allowing for robust tests of the neutron star equation of state. Here we report observations of ZTF J1406+1222, a wide hierarchical triple hosting a 62-minute orbital period black widow candidate, the optical flux of which varies by a factor of more than ten. ZTF J1406+1222 pushes the boundaries of evolutionary models<SUP>5</SUP>, falling below the 80-minute minimum orbital period of hydrogen-rich systems. The wide tertiary companion is a rare low-metallicity cool subdwarf star, and the system has a Galactic halo orbit consistent with passing near the Galactic Centre, making it a probe of formation channels, neutron star kick physics<SUP>6</SUP> and binary evolution.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Natur.605...41B
Close, bright, and boxy: the superluminous SN 2018hti;;SN 2018hti was a very nearby (z = 0.0614) superluminous supernova with an exceedingly bright absolute magnitude of -21.7 mag in r band at maximum. The densely sampled pre-maximum light curves of SN 2018hti show a slow luminosity evolution and constrain the rise time to ~50 rest-frame d. We fitted synthetic light curves to the photometry to infer the physical parameters of the explosion of SN 2018hti for both the magnetar and the CSM-interaction scenarios. We conclude that one of two mechanisms could be powering the luminosity of SN 2018hti; interaction with ~10 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of circumstellar material or a magnetar with a magnetic field of B<SUB>p</SUB>~ 1.3 × 10<SUP>13</SUP> G, and initial period of P<SUB>spin</SUB>~ 1.8 ms. From the nebular spectrum modelling we infer that SN 2018hti likely results from the explosion of a ${\sim}40\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ progenitor star.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.4484F
Formation and fate of low-metallicity stars in TNG50;;Low-metallicity stars give rise to unique spectacular transients and are of immense interest for understanding stellar evolution. Their importance has only grown further with the recent detections of mergers of stellar mass black holes that likely originate mainly from low-metallicity progenitor systems. Moreover, the formation of low-metallicity stars is intricately linked to galaxy evolution, in particular to early enrichment and to later accretion and mixing of lower metallicity gas. Because low-metallicity stars are difficult to observe directly, cosmological simulations are crucial for understanding their formation. Here, we quantify the rates and locations of low-metallicity star formation using the high-resolution TNG50 magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation, and we examine where low-metallicity stars end up at z = 0. We find that $20{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of stars with $Z_* 0.1\, \mathrm{Z_\odot }$ form after z = 2, and that such stars are still forming in galaxies of all masses at z = 0 today. Moreover, most low-metallicity stars at z = 0 reside in massive galaxies. We analyse the radial distribution of low-metallicity star formation and discuss the curious case of seven galaxies in TNG50 that form stars from primordial gas even at z = 0.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.3602P
The 6 × 2pt method: supernova velocities meet multiple tracers;;We present a new methodology to analyse in a comprehensive way large-scale and supernova (or any other distance indicator) surveys. Our approach combines galaxy and supernova position and redshift data with supernova peculiar velocities, obtained through their magnitude scatter, to construct a 6 × 2pt analysis that includes six power spectra. The 3 × 3 correlation matrix of these spectra expresses exhaustively the information content of the surveys at the linear level. We then proceed to forecast the performance of future surveys like Legacy Survey of Space and Time and 4MOST with a Fisher matrix analysis, adopting both a model-dependent and a model-independent approach. We compare the performance of the 6 × 2pt approach to that of the traditional one using only galaxy clustering and some recently proposed combinations of galaxy and supernova data and quantify the possible gains by optimally extracting the linear information. We show that the 6 × 2pt method shrinks the uncertainty area in the $\sigma _8, \, \gamma$ plane by more than half when compared to the traditional method. The combined clustering and velocity data on the growth of structures have uncertainties at similar levels to those of the cosmic microwave background but exhibit orthogonal degeneracies, and the combined constraints yield improvements of factors of 5 or more in each of the five cosmological parameters considered here. Concerning the model-independent results, we find that our method can improve the constraints on H(z)/H<SUB>0</SUB> in all redshift bins by more than 70 per cent with respect to the galaxy clustering alone and by 30 per cent when supernova velocities (but not clustering) are considered, reaching a precision of 3-4 per cent at high redshifts.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.2841Q
Progenitor and close-in circumstellar medium of type II supernova 2020fqv from high-cadence photometry and ultra-rapid UV spectroscopy;;We present observations of SN 2020fqv, a Virgo-cluster type II core-collapse supernova (CCSN) with a high temporal resolution light curve from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) covering the time of explosion; ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) starting 3.3 d post-explosion; ground-based spectroscopic observations starting 1.1 d post-explosion; along with extensive photometric observations. Massive stars have complicated mass-loss histories leading up to their death as CCSNe, creating circumstellar medium (CSM) with which the SNe interact. Observations during the first few days post-explosion can provide important information about the mass-loss rate during the late stages of stellar evolution. Model fits to the quasi-bolometric light curve of SN 2020fqv reveal 0.23 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of CSM confined within 1450 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> (10<SUP>14</SUP> cm) from its progenitor star. Early spectra (<4 d post-explosion), both from HST and ground-based observatories, show emission features from high-ionization metal species from the outer, optically thin part of this CSM. We find that the CSM is consistent with an eruption caused by the injection of ~5 × 10<SUP>46</SUP> erg into the stellar envelope ~300 d pre-explosion, potentially from a nuclear burning instability at the onset of oxygen burning. Light-curve fitting, nebular spectroscopy, and pre-explosion HST imaging consistently point to a red supergiant (RSG) progenitor with $M_{\rm ZAMS}\approx 13.5\!-\!15 \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$, typical for SN II progenitor stars. This finding demonstrates that a typical RSG, like the progenitor of SN 2020fqv, has a complicated mass-loss history immediately before core collapse.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.2777T
Discovery of extreme, roughly daily superflares on the recurrent nova V2487 Oph;;V2487 Oph is a recurrent nova with detected eruptions in 1900 and 1998. Startlingly, V2487 Oph shows flares, called 'Superflares', with up to 1.10 mag amplitude, fast rises of under one-minute, always with an initial impulsive spike followed by a roughly exponential tail, typically one-hour durations, and with random event times averaging once-per-day. The typical flare energy E is over 10<SUP>38</SUP> erg, while the yearly energy budget is 10<SUP>41</SUP> erg. V2487 Oph Superflares obey three relations; the number distribution of flare energies scales as E<SUP>-2.34 ± 0.35</SUP>, the waiting time from one flare to the next is proportional to E of the first event, and flare durations scale as E<SUP>0.44 ± 0.03</SUP>. Scenarios involving gravitational energy and nuclear energy fail to satisfy the three relations. The magnetic energy scenario, however, can explain all three relations. This scenario has magnetic field lines above the disc being twisted and amplified by the motions of their footprints, with magnetic reconnection releasing energy that comes out as Superflare light. This exact mechanism is already well known to occur in white light solar flares, in ordinary M-type flare stars, and in the many Superflare stars observed all across the H-R diagram. Superflares on Superflare stars have rise times, light-curve shapes, and durations that are very similar to those on V2487 Oph. So we conclude that the V2487 Oph Superflares are caused by large-scale magnetic reconnection. V2487 Oph is now the most extreme Superflare star, exhibiting the largest known flare energy (1.6 × 10<SUP>39</SUP> erg) and the fastest occurrence rate.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.1924S
Low-efficiency long gamma-ray bursts: a case study with AT2020blt;;The Zwicky Transient Facility recently announced the detection of an optical transient AT2020blt at redshift z = 2.9, consistent with the afterglow of an on-axis gamma-ray burst. However, no prompt emission was observed. We analyse AT2020blt with detailed models, showing the data are best explained as the afterglow of an on-axis long gamma-ray burst, ruling out other hypotheses such as a cocoon and a low-Lorentz factor jet. We search Fermi data for prompt emission, setting deeper upper limits on the prompt emission than in the original detection paper. Together with KONUS-Wind observations, we show that the gamma-ray efficiency of AT2020blt is $\lesssim 0.3\!-\!4.5{{\ \rm per\, cent}}$. We speculate that AT2020blt and AT2021any belong to the low-efficiency tail of long gamma-ray burst distributions that are beginning to be readily observed due to the capabilities of new observatories like the Zwicky Transient Facility.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.1391S
Constraining Type Ia supernova explosions and early flux excesses with the Zwicky Transient Factory;;In the new era of time-domain surveys, Type Ia supernovae are being caught sooner after explosion, which has exposed significant variation in their early light curves. Two driving factors for early-time evolution are the distribution of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni in the ejecta and the presence of flux excesses of various causes. We perform an analysis of the largest young SN Ia sample to date. We compare 115 SN Ia light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility to the TURTLS model grid containing light curves of Chandrasekhar mass explosions with a range of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni masses, <SUP>56</SUP>Ni distributions, and explosion energies. We find that the majority of our observed light curves are well reproduced by Chandrasekhar mass explosion models with a preference for highly extended <SUP>56</SUP>Ni distributions. We identify six SNe Ia with an early-time flux excess in our gr-band data (four 'blue' and two 'red' flux excesses). We find an intrinsic rate of 18 ± 11 per cent of early flux excesses in SNe Ia at z < 0.07, based on three detected flux excesses out of 30 (10 per cent) observed SNe Ia with a simulated efficiency of 57 per cent. This is comparable to rates of flux excesses in the literature but also accounts for detection efficiencies. Two of these events are mostly consistent with circumstellar material interaction, while the other four have longer lifetimes in agreement with companion interaction and <SUP>56</SUP>Ni-clump models. We find a higher frequency of flux excesses in 91T/99aa-like events (44 ± 13 per cent).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.1317D
Dust and the intrinsic spectral index of quasar variations: hints of finite stress at the innermost stable circular orbit;;We present a study of 9 242 spectroscopically confirmed quasars with multiepoch ugriz photometry from the SDSS Southern Survey. By fitting a separable linear model to each quasar's spectral variations, we decompose their five-band spectral energy distributions into variable (disc) and non-variable (host galaxy) components. In modelling the disc spectra, we include attenuation by dust on the line of sight through the host galaxy to its nucleus. We consider five commonly used attenuation laws, and find that the best description is by dust similar to that of the Small Magellanic Cloud, inferring a lack of carbonaceous grains from the relatively weak 2175-Å absorption feature. We go on to construct a composite spectrum for the quasar variations spanning 700-8000 Å. By varying the assumed power-law L<SUB>ν</SUB> ∝ ν<SUP>α</SUP> spectral slope, we find a best-fitting value α = 0.71 ± 0.02, excluding at high confidence the canonical L<SUB>ν</SUB> ∝ ν<SUP>1/3</SUP> prediction for a steady-state accretion disc with a T ∝ r<SUP>-3/4</SUP> temperature profile. The bluer spectral index of the observed quasar variations instead supports the model of Agol & Krolik, and Mummery & Balbus, in which a steeper temperature profile, T ∝ r<SUP>-7/8</SUP>, develops as a result of finite magnetically induced stress at the innermost stable circular orbit extracting energy and angular momentum from the black hole spin.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512..899W

Rubin Observatory;;The discovery of the electromagnetic counterpart to the binary neutron star (NS) merger GW170817 has opened the era of gravitational-wave multimessenger astronomy. Rapid identification of the optical/infrared kilonova enabled a precise localization of the source, which paved the way to deep multiwavelength follow-up and its myriad of related science results. Fully exploiting this new territory of exploration requires the acquisition of electromagnetic data from samples of NS mergers and other gravitational-wave sources. After GW170817, the frontier is now to map the diversity of kilonova properties and provide more stringent constraints on the Hubble constant, and enable new tests of fundamental physics. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time can play a key role in this field in the 2020s, when an improved network of gravitational-wave detectors is expected to reach a sensitivity that will enable the discovery of a high rate of merger events involving NSs (~tens per year) out to distances of several hundred megaparsecs. We design comprehensive target-of-opportunity observing strategies for follow-up of gravitational-wave triggers that will make the Rubin Observatory the premier instrument for discovery and early characterization of NS and other compact-object mergers, and yet unknown classes of gravitational-wave events.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..260...18A
The GALEX-PTF Experiment. II. Supernova Progenitor Radius and Energetics via Shock-cooling Modeling;;The radius and surface composition of an exploding massive star, as well as the explosion energy per unit mass, can be measured using early ultraviolet (UV) observations of core-collapse supernovae (CC SNe). We present the results from a simultaneous Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) and Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) search for early UV emission from SNe. We analyze five CC SNe for which we obtained near-UV (NUV) measurements before the first ground-based R-band detection. We introduce SOPRANOS, a new maximum likelihood fitting tool for models with variable temporal validity windows, and use it to fit the Sapir & Waxman shock-cooling model to the data. We report four Type II SNe with progenitor radii in the range of R <SUB>*</SUB> ≍ 600-1100 R <SUB>⊙</SUB> and a shock velocity parameter in the range of v <SUB> s*</SUB> ≍ 2700-6000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> (E/M ≍ 2-8 × 10<SUP>50</SUP> erg/M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) and one Type IIb SN with R <SUB>*</SUB> ≍ 210 R <SUB>⊙</SUB> and v <SUB> s*</SUB> ≍ 11,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> (E/M ≍ 1.8 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg/M <SUB>⊙</SUB>). Our pilot GALEX/PTF project thus suggests that a dedicated, systematic SN survey in the NUV band, such as the wide-field UV explorer ULTRASAT mission, is a compelling method to study the properties of SN progenitors and SN energetics.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...931...71G
Optical Observations and Modeling of the Superluminous Supernova 2018lfe;;We present optical imaging and spectroscopy of SN 2018lfe, which we classify as a Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) at a redshift of z = 0.3501 ± 0.0004 with a peak absolute magnitude of M <SUB> r </SUB> = -22.1 ± 0.1 mag, one of the brightest SLSNe discovered. SN 2018lfe was identified for follow-up using our FLEET machine-learning pipeline. Both the light curve and the spectra of SN 2018lfe are consistent with the broad population of SLSNe. We fit the light curve with a magnetar central engine model and find an ejecta mass of M <SUB>ej</SUB> ≈ 3.8 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, a magnetar spin period of P ≈ 2.9 ms, and a magnetic field strength of B <SUB>⊥</SUB> ≈ 2.8 × 10<SUP>14</SUP> G. The magnetic field strength is near the top of the distribution for SLSNe, while the spin period and ejecta mass are near the median values of the distribution for SLSNe. From late-time imaging and spectroscopy we find that the host galaxy of SN 2018lfe has an absolute magnitude of M <SUB> r </SUB> = -17.85 ± 0.24, (L <SUB> B </SUB> = 0.029 ± 0.007L*), and an inferred metallicity of Z ≈ 0.3 Z <SUB>⊙</SUB> and star formation rate of ≈0.8 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...931...32Y
X-Ray Observation of the Roche-lobe-filling White Dwarf plus Hot Subdwarf System ZTF J213056.71+442046.5;;ZTF J213056.71+442046.5 is the prototype of a small class of recently discovered compact binaries composed of a white dwarf and a hot subdwarf that fills its Roche lobe. Its orbital period of only 39 minutes is the shortest known for the objects in this class. Evidence for a high orbital inclination (i = 86°) and for the presence of an accretion disk has been inferred from a detailed modeling of its optical photometric and spectroscopic data. We report the results of an XMM-Newton observation carried out on 2021 January 7. ZTF J213056.71+442046.5 was clearly detected by the Optical Monitor, which showed a periodic variability in the UV band (200-400 nm), with a light curve similar to that seen at longer wavelengths. Despite accretion on the white dwarf at an estimated rate of the order of 10<SUP>-9 </SUP> M <SUB>⊙ </SUB>yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, no X-rays were detected with the EPIC instrument, with a limit of ~10<SUP>30</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> on the 0.2-12 keV luminosity. We discuss possible explanations for the lack of a strong X-ray emission from this system.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...931...13M
Discovery of ATLAS17jrp as an Optical-, X-Ray-, and Infrared-bright Tidal Disruption Event in a Star-forming Galaxy;;We hereby report the discovery of ATLAS17jrp as an extraordinary tidal disruption event (TDE) in the star-forming galaxy SDSS J162034.99+240726.5 in our recent sample of mid-infrared outbursts in nearby galaxies. Its optical/UV light curves rise to a peak luminosity of ~1.06 × 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> in about a month and then decay as t <SUP>-5/3</SUP> with a roughly constant temperature around 19,000 K, and the optical spectra show a blue continuum and very broad Balmer lines with FWHM ~ 15,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which gradually narrowed to 1400 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> within 4 yr, all agreeing well with other optical TDEs. A delayed and rapidly rising X-ray flare with a peak luminosity of ~1.27 × 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> was detected ~170 days after the optical peak. The high MIR luminosity of ATLAS17jrp (~2 × 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>) has revealed a distinctive dusty environment with a covering factor as high as ~0.2, which is comparable to that of a torus in active galactic nuclei but at least one order of magnitude higher than normal optical TDEs. Therefore, ATLAS17jrp turns out to be one of the rare unambiguous TDEs found in star-forming galaxies, and its high dust-covering factor implies that dust extinction could play an important role in the absence of optical TDEs in star-forming galaxies.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930L...4W
Long-term Evolution of a Supernova Remnant Hosting a Double Neutron Star Binary;;An ultra-stripped supernova (USSN) is a type of core-collapse supernova explosion proposed to be a candidate formation site of a double neutron star (DNS) binary. We investigate the dynamical evolution of an ultra-stripped supernova remnant (USSNR), which should host a DNS at its center. By accounting for the mass-loss history of the progenitor binary using a model developed by a previous study, we construct the large-scale structure of the circumstellar medium (CSM) up to a radius ~100 pc, and simulate the explosion and subsequent evolution of a USSN surrounded by such a CSM environment. We find that the CSM encompasses an extended region characterized by a hot plasma with a temperature ~10<SUP>8</SUP> K located around the termination shock of the wind from the progenitor binary (~10 pc), and the USSNR blast wave is drastically weakened while penetrating through this hot plasma. Radio continuum emission from a young USSNR is sufficiently bright to be detectable if it inhabits our galaxy but faint compared to the observed Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs), and thereafter declines in luminosity through adiabatic cooling. Within our parameter space, USSNRs typically exhibit a low radio luminosity and surface brightness compared to the known Galactic SNRs. Due to the small event rate of USSNe and their relatively short observable life span, we calculate that USSNRs account for only ~0.1%-1% of the total SNR population. This is consistent with the fact that no SNR hosting a DNS binary has been discovered in the Milky Way so far.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930..143M
Evolution of a Peculiar Type Ibn Supernova SN 2019wep;;We present a high-cadence short term photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign of a type Ibn SN 2019wep, which is one of the rare SN Ibn after SNe 2010al and 2019uo to display signatures of flash ionization (He II, C III, N III). We compare the decline rates and rise time of SN 2019wep with other SNe Ibn and fast transients. The post-peak decline in all bands (0.1 mag day<SUP>-1</SUP>) are consistent with SNe Ibn but less than the fast transients. On the other hand, the Δm <SUB>15</SUB> values are slightly lower than the average values for SNe Ibn but consistent with the fast transients. The rise time is typically shorter than SNe Ibn but longer than fast transients. SN 2019wep lies at the fainter end of SNe Ibn but possesses an average luminosity among the fast transients sample. The peculiar color evolution places it between SNe Ib and the most extreme SNe Ibn. The bolometric light-curve modeling shows resemblance with SN 2019uo with ejecta masses consistent with SNe Ib. SN 2019wep belongs to the P cygni subclass of SNe Ibn and shows faster evolution in line velocities as compared to the emission subclass. The post-maximum spectra show close resemblance with ASASSN-15ed hinting it to be of SN Ib nature. The low He I CSM velocities and residual Hα further justifies it and provide evidence of an intermittent progenitor between Wolf-Rayet and LBV stars.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930..127G
Wave-driven Outbursts and Variability of Low-mass Supernova Progenitors;;In a substantial number of core-collapse supernovae (SNe), early-time interaction indicates a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) that may be produced by outbursts from the progenitor star. Wave-driven mass loss is a possible mechanism to produce these signatures, with previous work suggesting that this mechanism is most effective for low-mass (~11 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) SN progenitors. Using one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with MESA, we study the effects of this wave heating in SN progenitors of masses M <SUB>ZAMS</SUB> = 10-13 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. This range encompasses stars that experience semidegenerate central neon burning and more degenerate off-center neon ignition. We find that central Ne ignition at M <SUB>ZAMS</SUB> = 11 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> produces a burst of intense wave heating that transmits ~10<SUP>47</SUP> erg of energy at 10 yr before core collapse, whereas other masses experience smaller levels of wave heating. Wave heating does not hydrodynamically drive mass loss in any of our models and is unlikely to produce a very massive CSM on its own. However, wave heating can cause large radial expansion (by more than an order of magnitude), photospheric cooling, and luminosity brightening by up to ~10<SUP>6</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> in hydrogen-poor stripped star models. Some Type Ib/c progenitors could drastically change their appearance in the final years of their lives, with brightness in the visual bands increasing by nearly 3 mag. Moreover, interaction with a close binary companion could drive intense mass loss, with implications for Type Ibn and other interaction-powered SNe.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930..119W
Galactic Positrons from Thermonuclear Supernovae;;Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) may originate from a wide variety of explosion scenarios and progenitor channels. They exhibit a factor of ≈10 difference in brightness and thus a differentiation in the mass of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni → <SUP>56</SUP>Co → <SUP>56</SUP>Fe. We present a study on the fate of positrons within SNe Ia in order to evaluate their escape fractions and energy spectra. Our detailed Monte Carlo transport simulations for positrons and γ-rays include both β <SUP>+</SUP> decay of <SUP>56</SUP>Co and pair production. We simulate a wide variety of explosion scenarios, including the explosion of white dwarfs (WDs) close to the Chandrasekhar mass (M <SUB>Ch</SUB>), He-triggered explosions of sub-M <SUB>Ch</SUB> WDs, and dynamical mergers of two WDs. For each model, we study the influence of the size and morphology of the progenitor magnetic field between 1 and 10<SUP>13</SUP> G. Population synthesis based on the observed brightness distribution of SNe Ia was used to estimate the overall contributions to Galactic positrons due to escape from SNe Ia. We find that this is dominated by SNe Ia of normal brightness, where variations in the distribution of emitted positrons are small. We estimate a total SNe Ia contribution to Galactic positrons of <2% and, depending on the magnetic field morphology, <6-20% for M <SUB>Ch</SUB> and sub-M <SUB>Ch</SUB>, respectively.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930..107M
A Rapid and Large-amplitude X-Ray Dimming Event in a z ≈ 2.6 Radio-quiet Quasar;;We report a dramatic, fast X-ray dimming event in a z = 2.627 radio-quiet type 1 quasar, which has an estimated supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass of 6.3 × 10<SUP>9</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. In the high X-ray state, it showed a typical level of X-ray emission relative to its UV/optical emission. Then its 0.5-2 keV (rest-frame 1.8-7.3 keV) flux dropped by a factor of ≈7.6 within two rest-frame days. The dimming is associated with spectral hardening, as the 2-7 keV (rest-frame 7.3-25.4 keV) flux dropped by only 17%, and the effective power-law photon index of the X-ray spectrum changed from ≈2.3 to ≈0.9. The quasar has an infrared (IR)-to-UV spectral energy distribution and a rest-frame UV spectrum similar to those of typical quasars, and it does not show any significant long-term variability in the IR and UV/optical bands. Such an extremely fast and large-amplitude X-ray variability event has not been reported before in luminous quasars with such massive SMBHs. The X-ray dimming is best explained by a fast-moving absorber crossing the line of sight and fully covering the X-ray emitting corona. Adopting a conservatively small size of 5 GM <SUB>BH</SUB>/c <SUP>2</SUP> for the X-ray corona, the transverse velocity of the absorber is estimated to be ≈0.9c. The quasar is likely accreting with a high or even super-Eddington accretion rate, and the high-velocity X-ray absorber is probably related to a powerful accretion-disk wind. Such an energetic wind may eventually evolve into a massive galactic-scale outflow, providing efficient feedback to the host galaxy.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930...53L
SN 2020jfo: A Short-plateau Type II Supernova from a Low-mass Progenitor;;We present spectroscopic and photometric observations of the Type IIP supernova, SN 2020jfo, in ultraviolet and optical wavelengths. SN 2020jfo occurred in the spiral galaxy M61 (NGC 4303), with eight observed supernovae in the past 100 yr. SN 2020jfo exhibited a short plateau lasting < 65 days, and achieved a maximum brightness in Vband of M <SUB> V </SUB> = -17.4 ± 0.4 mag at about 8.0 ± 0.5 days since explosion. From the bolometric light curve, we have estimated the mass of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni synthesized in the explosion to be 0.033 ± 0.006 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The observed spectral features are typical for a Type IIP supernova except for shallow Hα absorption throughout the evolution and the presence of stable <SUP>58</SUP>Ni feature at 7378 Å, in the nebular phase. Using hydrodynamical modeling in the MESA + STELLA framework, an ejecta mass of ~5 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> is estimated. Models also indicate SN 2020jfo could be the result of a red supergiant progenitor with M <SUB>ZAMS</SUB> ~ 12 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Bolometric light-curve modeling revealed the presence of a secondary radiation source for initial ~20 days, which has been attributed to interaction with a circumstellar material of mass ~ 0.2 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, which most likely was ejected due to enhanced mass loss about 20 yr prior to the supernova explosion.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930...34T
Characterization of Supernovae Based on the Spectral-Temporal Energy Distribution: Two Possible SN Ib Subtypes;;A quantitative data-driven comparison among supernovae (SNe) based on their spectral time series combined with multiband photometry is presented. We use an unsupervised random forest algorithm as a metric on a set of 82 well-documented SNe representing all the main spectroscopic types, in order to embed these in an abstract metric space reflecting shared correlations between the objects. We visualize the resulting metric space in 3D, revealing strong agreement with the current spectroscopic classification scheme. The embedding splits Type Ib supernovae into two groups, with one subgroup exhibiting broader, less prominent, higher-velocity lines than the other, possibly suggesting a new SN Ib subclass is required. The method could be to classify newly discovered SNe according to their distance from known event groups, or ultimately to devise a new, spectral-temporal classification scheme. Such an embedding could also depend on hidden parameters that may perhaps be physically interpretable.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930...31B
The Curious Case of ASASSN-20hx: A Slowly Evolving, UV- and X-Ray-Luminous, Ambiguous Nuclear Transient;;We present observations of ASASSN-20hx, a nearby ambiguous nuclear transient (ANT) discovered in NGC 6297 by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). We observed ASASSN-20hx from -30 to 275 days relative to the peak UV/optical emission using high-cadence, multiwavelength spectroscopy and photometry. From Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data, we determine that the ANT began to brighten on 2020 June 22.8 with a linear rise in flux for at least the first week. ASASSN-20hx peaked in the UV/optical 30 days later on 2020 July 22.8 (MJD = 59052.8) at a bolometric luminosity of L = (3.15 ± 0.04) × 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The subsequent decline is slower than any TDE observed to date and consistent with many other ANTs. Compared to an archival X-ray detection, the X-ray luminosity of ASASSN-20hx increased by an order of magnitude to L <SUB> x </SUB> ~ 1.5 × 10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> and then slowly declined over time. The X-ray emission is well fit by a power law with a photon index of Γ ~ 2.3-2.6. Both the optical and near-infrared spectra of ASASSN-20hx lack emission lines, unusual for any known class of nuclear transient. While ASASSN-20hx has some characteristics seen in both tidal disruption events and active galactic nuclei, it cannot be definitively classified with current data.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930...12H
The Donor of the Black Hole X-Ray Binary MAXI J1820+070;;We estimate the parameters of the donor of the accreting black hole binary MAXI J1820+070. The measured values of the binary period, rotational and radial velocities, and constraints on the orbital inclination imply the donor is a subgiant with the mass of ${M}_{2}\approx {0.49}_{-0.10}^{+0.10}{M}_{\odot }$ and the radius of ${R}_{2}\approx {1.19}_{-0.08}^{+0.08}{R}_{\odot }$ . We reanalyze the previously obtained optical spectrum from the Gran Telescopio Canarias and found it yields a strict lower limit on the effective temperature of T > 4200 K. We compile optical and infrared fluxes observed during the quiescence of this system. From the minima r- and i-band fluxes found in Pan-STARSS1 Data Release 2 prediscovery imaging and for a distance of D ≈ 3 kpc, reddening of E(B - V) = 0.23, and R <SUB>2</SUB> ≈ 1.11R <SUB>⊙</SUB>, we find T ≲ 4230 K, very close to the above lower limit. For a larger distance, the temperature can be higher, up to about 4500 K (corresponding to a K5 spectral type, preferred by previous studies) at D = 3.5 kpc, allowed by the Gaia parallax. We perform evolutionary calculations for the binary system and compare them to the observational constraints. Our model fitting the above temperature and radius constraints at D ≈ 3 kpc has a mass of 0.4M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, T ≈ 4200 K, and solar metallicity. Two alternative models require D ≳ 3.3-3.4 kpc at 0.4M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, T ≈ 4500 K and half-solar metallicity, and 0.5M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, T ≈ 4300 K, and solar metallicity. These models yield mass-transfer rates of ~10<SUP>-10</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, compatible with those based on the estimated accreted mass of ≈2 × 10<SUP>25</SUP> g and the time between the 2018 discovery and the 1934 historical outburst.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...930....9M
Zwicky Transient Facility and Globular Clusters: The RR Lyrae gri-band Period-Luminosity-Metallicity and Period-Wesenheit-Metallicity Relations;;Based on time-series observations collected from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), we derived period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) and period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relations for RR Lyrae located in globular clusters. We have applied various selection criteria to exclude RR Lyrae with problematic or spurious light curves. These selection criteria utilized information on the number of data points per light curve, amplitudes, colors, and residuals on the period-luminosity and/or period-Wesenheit relations. Due to blending, a number of RR Lyrae in globular clusters were found to be anomalously bright and have small amplitudes of their ZTF light curves. We used our final sample of ~750 RR Lyrae in 46 globular clusters covering a wide metallicity range (-2.36 dex < [Fe/H] < -0.54 dex) to derive PLZ and PWZ relations in the gri bands. In addition, we have also derived the period-color-metallicity and, for the first time, the period-Q-index-metallicity relations, where the Q-index is extinction-free by construction. We have compared our various relations to empirical and theoretical relations available in the literature and found a good agreement with most studies. Finally, we applied our derived PLZ relation to a dwarf galaxy, Crater II, and found that its true distance modulus should be larger than the most recent determination.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..239N
Optical Characterization of Two Cataclysmic Variables: RBS 0490 and SDSS J075939.79+191417.3;;We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of two cataclysmic variables (CVs), namely RBS 0490 and SDSS J075939.79+191417.3. The optical variations of RBS 0490 have been found to occur with a period of 1.689 ± 0.001 hr, which appears to be the probable orbital period of the system. Present photometric observations of SDSS J075939.79+191417.3 confirm and refine the previously determined orbital period as 3.14240928 ± 0.00000096 hr. The presence of long-duration eclipse features in the light curves of SDSS J075939.79+191417.3 indicates that eclipses might be due to an accretion disk and bright spot. The orbital inclination of SDSS J075939.79+191417.3 is estimated to be ~78° using the eclipse morphology. The phased light-curve variations during the orbital cycle of RBS 0490 provide evidence of emission from an independent second accretion region or a second fainter pole. Optical spectra of RBS 0490 and SDSS J075939.79+191417.3 show the presence of strong Balmer and weak He II (λ4686) emission lines, along with the detection of strong Hβ emission lines with a large equivalent width. The characteristic features of RBS 0490 seem to favor low-field polars, while SDSS J075939.79+191417.3 appears to be similar to nonmagnetic systems.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..221J
Limits on the Detection of Planet Nine in the Dark Energy Survey;;Studies of the clustering of the most distant Kuiper Belt objects in the outer solar system have hinted at the possible existence of a planet beyond Neptune referred to as Planet Nine (P9). Recent efforts have constrained the parameter space of the orbital elements of P9, allowing for the creation of a synthetic catalog of hypothetical P9s. By examining the potential recovery of such a catalog within numerous sky surveys, it is possible to further constrain the parameter space for P9, providing direction for a more targeted search. We examine the ability of the full six years of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to recover a synthetic Planet Nine population presented in Brown & Batygin. We find that out of 100,000 simulated objects, 11,709 cross the wide DES survey footprint of which 10,187 (87.0%) are recovered. This rules out an additional 5% of the parameter space after accounting for Planets Nine that would have been detected by both the Zwicky Transient Facility and DES.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..216B
HEALPix Alchemy: Fast All-Sky Geometry and Image Arithmetic in a Relational Database for Multimessenger Astronomy Brokers;;Efficient searches for electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave, high-energy neutrino, and gamma-ray burst events demand rapid processing of image arithmetic and geometry set operations in a database to cross-match galaxy catalogs, observation footprints, and all-sky images. Here we introduce HEALPix Alchemy, an open-source, pure Python implementation of a set of methods that enables rapid all-sky geometry calculations. HEALPix Alchemy is built upon HEALPix, a spatial indexing strategy that is widely used in astronomical databases as well as the native format of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave sky localization maps. Our approach leverages new multirange types built into the PostgreSQL 14 database engine. This enables fast all-sky queries against probabilistic multimessenger event localizations and telescope survey footprints. Questions such as "What are the galaxies contained within the 90% credible region of an event?" and "What is the rank-ordered list of the fields within an observing footprint with the highest probability of containing the event?" can be performed in less than a few seconds on commodity hardware using off-the-shelf cloud-managed database implementations without server-side database extensions. Common queries scale roughly linearly with the number of telescope pointings. As the number of fields grows into the hundreds or thousands, HEALPix Alchemy is orders of magnitude faster than other implementations. HEALPix Alchemy is now used as the spatial geometry engine within SkyPortal, which forms the basis of the Zwicky Transient Facility transient marshal, called Fritz.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..209S
THA 15−31: Discovery with VLT/X-shooter and Swift/UVOT of a new symbiotic star of the accreting-only variety;;We report the discovery and characterization of a new symbiotic star of the accreting-only variety, which we observed in the optical/near-infrared (NIR) with VLT/X-shooter and in the X-rays/ultraviolet with Swift/UVOT+XRT. The new symbiotic star, THA 15−31, was previously described as a pre-main sequence star belonging to the Lupus 3 association. Our observations, ancillary data, and Gaia EDR3 parallax indicate that THA 15−31 is a symbiotic star composed of an M6III red giant and an accreting companion, is subject to E<SUB>B − V</SUB> = 0.38 reddening, and is located at a distance of ∼12 kpc and at 1.8 kpc above the Galactic plane in the outskirts of the Bulge. The luminosity of the accreting companion is ∼100 L<SUB>⊙</SUB>, placing THA 15−31 among the symbiotic stars accreting at a high rate (2.5 × 10<SUP>−8</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>−1</SUP> if the accretion is occurring on a white dwarf of 1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). The observed emission lines originate primarily from H I, He I, and Fe II, with no He II or other high-excitation lines observed; a sharp central absorption superimposed on the Balmer emission lines is observed, while all other lines have a simple Gaussian-like profile. The emission from the companion dominates over the M6III red giant at U and B-band wavelengths, and is consistent with an origin primarily in an optically thick accretion disk. No significant photometric variability is observed at optical or NIR wavelengths, suggesting either a face-on orbital orientation and/or that the red giant is far from Roche-lobe filling conditions. The profile of emission lines supports a low orbital inclination if they form primarily in the accretion disk. An excess emission is present in AllWISE W3 (12 μm) and W4 (22 μm) data, radiating a luminosity ≥35 L<SUB>⊙</SUB>, consistent with thermal emission from optically thin circumstellar dust.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...661A.124M
Radial velocity variability and the evolution of hot subdwarf stars;;Hot subdwarf stars represent a late and peculiar stage in the evolution of low-mass stars, since they are likely formed by close binary interactions. In this work, we perform a radial velocity (RV) variability study of a sample of 646 hot subdwarfs with multi-epoch radial velocities based on spectra from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). The atmospheric parameters and RVs were taken from the literature. For stars with archival spectra but without literature values, we determined the parameters by fitting model atmospheres. In addition, we redetermined the atmospheric parameters and RVs for all the He-enriched sdO/Bs. This broad sample allowed us to study RV-variability as a function of the location in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> − log g- and T<SUB>eff</SUB> − log n(He)/n(H) diagrams in a statistically significant way. We used the fraction of RV-variable stars and the distribution of the maximum RV variations ΔRV<SUB>max</SUB> as diagnostics. Both indicators turned out to be quite inhomogeneous across the studied parameter ranges. A striking feature is the completely dissimilar behaviour of He-poor and He-rich hot subdwarfs. While the former have a high fraction of close binaries, almost no significant RV variations could be detected for the latter. This has led us to the conclusion that there is likely no evolutionary connection between these subtypes. On the other hand, intermediate He-rich- and extreme He-rich sdOB/Os are more likely to be related. Furthermore, we conclude that the vast majority of this population is formed via one or several binary merger channels. Hot subdwarfs with temperatures cooler than ∼24 000 K tend to show fewer and smaller RV-variations. These objects might constitute a new subpopulation of binaries with longer periods and late-type or compact companions. The RV-variability properties of the extreme horizontal branch (EHB) and corresponding post-EHB populations of the He-poor hot subdwarfs match and confirm the predicted evolutionary connection between them. Stars found below the canonical EHB at somewhat higher surface gravities show large RV variations and a high RV variability fraction. These properties are consistent with most of them being low-mass EHB stars or progenitors of low-mass helium white dwarfs in close binaries.

Identification of SRGt 062340.2-265751 as a bright, strongly variable, novalike cataclysmic variable;;We report the identification and follow-up of the transient SRGt 062340.2-265751 detected with both instruments on board the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma mission. Optical spectroscopy of the G = 12.5 counterpart firmly classifies the object as a novalike cataclysmic variable (CV) at a distance of 495 pc. A highly significant TESS period of 3.941 h, tentatively identified with the orbital period of the binary, could not be found when the object was reobserved with TESS two years later. The newer high-cadence TESS data revealed quasi-periodic oscillations around 25 min, while ground-based photometry indicated periodic variability at 32 min. Located in very sparsely populated regions of color-magnitude diagrams involving X-ray and optical magnitudes and colors, the new object could be an X-ray underluminous magnetic CV, an intermediate polar, or an overluminous nonmagnetic CV. The lack of uniquely identified spin and orbital periods prevents a final classification. The site of X-ray production in the system, L<SUB>X</SUB>,<SUB>bol</SUB> = 4.8 × 10<SUP>32</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>, remains to be understood given its high variability on long and short timescales.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...661A..42S
Identification of three cataclysmic variables detected by the ART-XC and eROSITA telescopes on board the SRG during the all-sky X-ray survey;;We report the discovery of three cataclysmic variables in the data of the first year of the all-sky X-ray survey by the SRG orbital observatory. The sources were selected for their brightness in the 4-12 keV band in the data of the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope. They are also detected by the eROSITA telescope, which provides accurate localizations and spectral data for a broadband spectral analysis. All three objects were previously known as X-ray sources from the ROSAT all-sky survey and XMM-Newton slew survey, but their nature remained unknown. The X-ray spectra obtained by eROSITA and ART-XC are consistent with optically thin thermal emission with a temperature kT ≳ 18 keV for SRGA J194638.9+704552 and SRGA J225412.8+690658 and kT ≳ 5 keV for SRGAJ204547.8+672642. Together with the inferred high X-ray luminosities (2 × 10<SUP>32</SUP>-3 × 10<SUP>33</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>), this strongly suggests that all three sources are cataclysmic variables (CVs). We have obtained optical photometry and spectroscopy for these objects using the AZT-33IK 1.6 m telescope of the Sayan Observatory. The optical properties confirm the CV nature of the objects. We conclude that SRGA J194638.9+704552 is an intermediate polar, SRGA J204547.8+672642 is likely a polar or intermediate polar, and SRGA J225412.8+690658 is either a magnetic or nonmagnetic CV. We have also measured an orbital period of 2.98 h for SRGA J204547.8+672642 based on TESS data. Three out of the planned eight SRG all-sky surveys have now been completed. We expect to find many new CVs, in particular, magnetic systems, during the survey, and we plan to continue our optical follow-up program.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...661A..39Z
Peculiar X-ray transient SRGA J043520.9+552226/AT2019wey discovered with SRG/ART-XC;;Context. During its ongoing all-sky survey, the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC (Astronomical Roentgen Telescope - X-ray Concentrator) telescope on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory is set to discover new X-ray sources, many of which can be transient. Here we report the discovery and multiwavelength follow-up of a peculiar X-ray source SRGA J043520.9+552226 = SRGe J043523.3+552234. This is the high-energy counterpart of the optical transient AT2019wey. 
 Aims: Through its sensitivity and the survey strategy, the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope uncovers poorly studied weak transient populations. Using the synergy with current public optical surveys, we aim to reveal the nature of these transients to study their parent populations. SRGA J043520.9+552226 is the first transient detected by ART-XC that has a bright optical counterpart suitable for further studies. 
 Methods: We used available public X-ray and optical data and observations with SRG, INTEGRAL, NuSTAR, NICER, Swift, and ground-based telescopes to investigate the spectral energy distributions of the source in different phases of the outburst. 
 Results: Based on X-ray spectral and timing properties derived from space observations, optical spectroscopy, and photometry obtained with the 2.5 m and RC600 telescopes of the Caucasian Mountain Observatory of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute of Moscow State University, we propose that the source is a black hole in a low-mass close X-ray binary system.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...661A..32M
SRG/ART-XC discovery of SRGA J204318.2+443815: Towards the complete population of faint X-ray pulsars;;We report the discovery of the new long-period X-ray pulsar SRGA J204318.2+443815/SRGe J204319.0+443820 in a Be binary system. The source was found in the second all-sky survey by the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope on board the SRG mission. The follow-up observations with XMM-Newton, NICER, and NuSTAR allowed us to discover a strong coherent signal in the source light curve with a period of ~742 s. The pulsed fraction was found to depend on an increase in energy from ~20% in soft X-rays to >50% at high energies, as is typical for X-ray pulsars. The source has a quite hard spectrum with an exponential cutoff at high energies and a bolometric luminosity of L<SUB>X</SUB> ≃ 4 × 10<SUP>35</SUP> ergs<SUP>-1</SUP>. The X-ray position of the source is found to be consistent with the optical transient ZTF18abjpmzf, located at a distance of ~8.0 kpc. Dedicated optical and infrared observations with the RTT-150, NOT, Keck, and Palomar telescopes revealed a number of emission lines (H<SUB>a</SUB>, He I, and the Paschen and Braket series) with a strongly absorbed continuum. According to the SRG scans and archival XMM-Newton data, the source flux is moderately variable (by a factor of 4-10) on timescales of several months and years. All this suggests that SRGA J204318.2+443815/SRGe J204319.0+443820 is a new quasi-persistent low-luminosity X-ray pulsar in a distant binary system with a Be-star of the B0-B2e class. Thus the SRG observatory allowed us to unveil a hidden population of faint objects, including a population of slowly rotating X-ray pulsars in Be systems.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...661A..28L
Linking the rates of neutron star binaries and short gamma-ray bursts;;Short gamma-ray bursts are believed to be produced by both binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. We use current estimates for the BNS and NSBH merger rates to calculate the fraction of observable short gamma-ray bursts produced through each channel. This allows us to constrain merger rates of a BNS to R<SUB>BNS</SUB>=38 4<SUB>-213</SUB><SUP>+431</SUP> Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> (90% credible interval), a 16% decrease in the rate uncertainties from the second Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO)-Virgo Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog. Assuming a top-hat emission profile with a large Lorentz factor, we constrain the average opening angle of gamma-ray burst jets produced in BNS mergers to ≈1 5 ° . We also measure the fraction of BNS and NSBH mergers that produce an observable short gamma-ray burst to be 0.02<SUB>-0.01</SUB><SUP>+0.02</SUP> and 0.01 ±0.01 , respectively, and find that ≳40 % of BNS mergers launch jets (90% confidence). We forecast constraints for future gravitational-wave detections given different modeling assumptions, including the possibility that BNS and NSBH jets are different. With 24 BNS and 55 NSBH observations, expected within six months of the LIGO-Virgo-Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector network operating at design sensitivity, it will be possible to constrain the fraction of BNS and NSBH mergers that launch jets with 10% precision. Within a year of observations, we can determine whether the jets launched in NSBH mergers have a different structure than those launched in BNS mergers and rule out whether ≳80 % of binary neutron star mergers launch jets. We discuss the implications of future constraints on understanding the physics of short gamma-ray bursts and binary evolution.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PhRvD.105h3004S
Wayne State University's Dan Zowada Memorial Observatory: Characterization and Pipeline of a 0.5 m Robotic Telescope;;Wayne State University's Dan Zowada Memorial Observatory is a fully robotic 0.5 m telescope and imaging system located under the dark skies of New Mexico. The observatory is particularly suited to time domain astronomy: the observation of variable objects, such as tidal disruption events, supernovae, and active galactic nuclei. We have developed a software suite for image reduction, alignment and stacking, and calculation of absolute photometry in the Sloan filters used at the telescope. Our pipeline also performs image subtraction to enable photometry of objects embedded in bright backgrounds such as galaxies. The 5σ detection limit of the Zowada Observatory for integration of 16 × 90 s exposures is 19.0 mag in g-band, 18.1 mag in r-band, 17.9 mag in i-band, and 16.6 mag in z-band. For a 3σ detection limit, measurements may be performed with greater uncertainties as deep as 19.9, 19.1. 18.9 and 17.5 mag in griz bands, respectively.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134d5002C
The case for space environmentalism;;The shell bound by the Karman line at a height of ~80-100 km above the Earth's surface and geosynchronous orbit at ~36,000 km is defined as the orbital space surrounding the Earth. It is within this region, and especially in low Earth orbit, where environmental issues are becoming urgent because of the rapid growth of the anthropogenic space object population, including satellite `mega-constellations'. In this Perspective, we summarize the case for considering the orbital space around the Earth as an additional ecosystem, subject to the same care and concerns, and the same broad regulations as the oceans and the atmosphere, for example. We rely on the orbital space environment by looking through it, as well as by working within it. Hence, we should consider damage to professional astronomy, public stargazing, and the cultural importance of the sky, as well as the sustainability of commercial, civic, and military activity in space. Damage to the orbital space environment has problematic features in common with other types of environmental issue. First, the observed and predicted damage is incremental and complex, with many contributors. Second, whether or not space is formally and legally seen as a global commons, the growing commercial exploitation of what may seem to be a `free' resource is in fact externalizing the true costs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022NatAs...6..428L
Post maximum light and late time optical imaging polarimetry of type I superluminous supernova 2020znr;;Optical imaging polarimetry was conducted on the hydrogen poor superluminous supernova 2020znr during three phases after maximum light (≈ +34 d, +288 d, and +289 d). After instrumental and interstellar polarization correction, all measurements are consistent with null-polarization detection. Modelling the light curve with a magnetar spin-down model shows that SN2020znr has similar magnetar and ejecta parameters to other SLSNe. A comparison of the best-fitting values discussed in the literature on SN 2017egm and SN 2015bn, two hydrogen poor SLSNe showing an increase of polarization after maximum light, suggests that SN 2020znr has higher mass ejecta that may prevent access to the geometry of the inner ejecta with optical polarimetry. The combined information provided by spectroscopy and light-curve analysis of type I SLSNe may be an interesting avenue to categorize the polarization properties of this class of transients. This approach would require to expand the sample of SLSNe polarimetry data currently available with early and late time epochs new measurements.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.5948P
Observationally driven Galactic double white dwarf population for LISA;;Realistic models of the Galactic double white dwarf (DWD) population are crucial for testing and quantitatively defining the science objectives of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a future European Space Agency's gravitational-wave observatory. In addition to numerous individually detectable DWDs, LISA will also detect an unresolved confusion foreground produced by the underlying Galactic population, which will affect the detectability of all LISA sources at frequencies below a few mHz. So far, the modelling of the DWD population for LISA has been based on binary population synthesis (BPS) techniques. The aim of this study is to construct an observationally driven population. To achieve this, we employ a model developed by Maoz, Hallakoun & Badenes for the statistical analysis of the local DWD population using two complementary large, multi-epoch, spectroscopic samples: the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the Supernova Ia Progenitor surveY. We calculate the number of LISA-detectable DWDs and the Galactic confusion foreground, based on their assumptions and results. We find that the observationally driven estimates yield (1) 2-5 times more individually detectable DWDs than various BPS forecasts, and (2) a significantly different shape of the DWD confusion foreground. Both results have important implications for the LISA mission. A comparison between several variations to our underlying assumptions shows that our observationally driven model is robust, and that the uncertainty on the total number of LISA-detectable DWDs is in the order of 20 per cent.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.5936K
Multiwavelength radiation models for low-luminosity GRBs and the implications for UHECRs;;We study the prompt phase of low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (ll-GRBs) as potential source of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays and ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Within the internal shock model, we choose parameters for the relativistic outflow such that our representative events have observed properties similar to GRBs 980425, 100316D, and 120714B, and self-consistently calculate the full spectral and temporal properties in a leptonic synchrotron self-Compton scenario. To investigate the conditions under which inverse Compton radiation may lead to a peak in the GeV-TeV range, we vary the fraction of internal energy supplying the magnetic field. Further, we determine the maximal energies achievable for UHECR nuclei and derive constraints on the baryonic loading/typical duration by comparing to the extragalactic gamma-ray background. We find that ll-GRBs are potential targets for multiwavelength studies and in reach for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) and optical/UV instruments. For comparable sub-MeV emission and similar dynamical evolution of the outflow, weak (strong) magnetic fields induce high (low) fluxes in the VHE regime and low (high) fluxes in the optical. VHE emission may be suppressed by γγ-absorption close to the engine or interactions with the extragalactic background light for redshifts z > 0.1. For UHECRs, the maximal energies of iron nuclei (protons) can be as high as ≃10<SUP>11</SUP> GeV (10<SUP>10</SUP> GeV) if the magnetic energy density is large (and the VHE component is correspondingly weak). These high energies are possible by decoupling the production regions of UHECR and gamma-rays in our multizone model. Finally, we find basic consistency with the energy budget needed to accommodate the UHECR origin from ll-GRBs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.5823R
AT2019azh: an unusually long-lived, radio-bright thermal tidal disruption event;;Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star is destroyed by a supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy, temporarily increasing the accretion rate on to the black hole and producing a bright flare across the electromagnetic spectrum. Radio observations of TDEs trace outflows and jets that may be produced. Radio detections of the outflows from TDEs are uncommon, with only about one-third of TDEs discovered to date having published radio detections. Here, we present over 2 yr of comprehensive, multiradio frequency monitoring observations of the TDE AT2019azh taken with the Very Large Array and MeerKAT radio telescopes from approximately 10 d pre-optical peak to 810 d post-optical peak. AT2019azh shows unusual radio emission for a thermal TDE, as it brightened very slowly over 2 yr, and showed fluctuations in the synchrotron energy index of the optically thin synchrotron emission from 450 d post-disruption. Based on the radio properties, we deduce that the outflow in this event is likely non-relativistic and could be explained by a spherical outflow arising from self-stream intersections or a mildly collimated outflow from accretion on to the supermassive black hole. This data set provides a significant contribution to the observational data base of outflows from TDEs, including the earliest radio detection of a non-relativistic TDE to date, relative to the optical discovery.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.5328G
Sensitive Chandra coverage of a representative sample of weak-line quasars: revealing the full range of X-ray properties;;We present deeper Chandra observations for weak-line quasars (WLQs) in a representative sample that previously had limited X-ray constraints, and perform X-ray photometric analyses to reveal the full range of X-ray properties of WLQs. Only 5 of the 32 WLQs included in this representative sample remain X-ray undetected after these observations, and a stacking analysis shows that these 5 have an average X-ray weakness factor of >85. One of the WLQs in the sample that was known to have extreme X-ray variability, SDSS J1539+3954, exhibited dramatic X-ray variability again: it changed from an X-ray normal state to an X-ray weak state within ≈3 months in the rest frame. This short time-scale for an X-ray flux variation by a factor of ≳9 further supports the thick disc and outflow (TDO) model proposed to explain the X-ray and multiwavelength properties of WLQs. The overall distribution of the X-ray-to-optical properties of WLQs suggests that the TDO has an average covering factor of the X-ray emitting region of ~0.5, and the column density of the TDO can range from $N_{\rm H}\, \sim 10^{23-24}~{\rm cm}^{-2}$ to $N_{\rm H}\, rsim 10^{24}~{\rm cm}^{-2}$, which leads to different levels of absorption and Compton reflection (and/or scattering) among WLQs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.5251N
What powers the radio emission in TDE AT2019dsg: A long-lived jet or the disruption itself?;;The tidal disruption event AT2019dsg was observed from radio to X-rays and was possibly accompanied by a high-energy neutrino. Previous interpretations have focused on continued injection by a central engine as the source of energy for radio emission. We show that continuous energy injection is unnecessary; the radio data can be explained by a single ejection of plasma that supplies all the energy needed. To support this assertion, we analyse the synchrotron self-absorbed spectra in terms of the equipartition model. Similar to previous analyses, we find that the energy in the radio-emitting region increases approximately ∝ t<SUP>0.7</SUP> and the length-scale of this region grows ∝ t at a rate $\simeq 0.06\, c$. This event resembles the earliest stage of a supernova remnant: because the ejected mass is much greater than the shocked external mass, its velocity remains unchanged, while the energy in shocked gas grows with time. The radio-emitting material gains energy from the outflow, not from continuing energy injection by the central object. Although energy injection from an accreting BH cannot be completely excluded, the energy injection rate is very different from the fallback luminosity, and maintaining constant outflow velocity requires fine-tuning, demanding further physical explanation. If the neutrino association is real, the energy injection needed is much greater than for the radio emission, suggesting that the detected neutrino did not arise from the radio-emitting region.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.5085M
Identifying blue large amplitude pulsators from Gaia DR2 and ZTF DR3;;Blue large amplitude pulsators (BLAPs) are hot, subluminous stars undergoing rapid variability with periods of under 60 min. They have been linked with the early stages of pre-white dwarfs and hot subdwarfs. They are a rare class of variable star due to their evolutionary history within interacting binary systems and the short time-scales relative to their lifetime in which they are pulsationally unstable. All currently known BLAPs are relatively faint (15-19 mag) and are located in the Galactic plane. These stars have intrinsically blue colours but the large interstellar extinction in the Galactic plane prevents them from swift identification using colour-based selection criteria. In this paper, we correct the Gaia G-band apparent magnitude and G<SUB>BP</SUB> - G<SUB>RP</SUB> colours of 89.6 million sources brighter than 19 mag in the Galactic plane with good quality photometry combined with supplementary all-sky data totalling 162.3 million sources. Selecting sources with colours consistent with the known population of BLAPs and performing a cross-match with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) DR3, we identify 98 short period candidate variables. Manual inspection of the period-folded light curves reveals 22 candidate BLAPs. Of these targets, 6 are consistent with the observed periods and light curves of the known BLAPs, 10 are within the theoretical period range of BLAPs, and 6 are candidate high-gravity BLAPs. We present follow-up spectra of 21 of these candidate sources and propose to classify one of them as a BLAP, and tentatively assign an additional eight of them as BLAPs for future population studies.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.4971M
Simulating time-varying strong lenses;;We present a self-consistent and versatile forward modelling software package that can produce time series and pixel-level simulations of time-varying strongly lensed systems. The time dimension, which needs to take into account different physical mechanisms for variability such as microlensing, has been missing from existing approaches and it is of direct relevance to time delay, and consequently H<SUB>0</SUB>, measurements and caustic crossing event predictions. Such experiments are becoming more streamlined, especially with the advent of time domain surveys, and understanding their systematic and statistical uncertainties in a model-aware and physics-driven way can help improve their accuracy and precision. Here, we demonstrate the software's capabilities by exploring the effect of measuring time delays from lensed quasars and supernovae in many wavelengths and under different microlensing and intrinsic variability assumptions. In this initial application, we find that the cadence of the observations and combining information from different wavelengths plays an important role in the correct recovery of the time delays. The MOCK LENSES IN TIME software package is available at https://github.com/gvernard/molet.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.4417V
Enhancement of double-close-binary quadruples;;Double-close-binary quadruples (2 + 2 systems) are hierarchical systems of four stars where two short-period binary systems move around their common centre of mass on a wider orbit. Using Gaia Early Data Release 3, we search for comoving pairs where both components are eclipsing binaries. We present eight 2 + 2 quadruple systems with inner orbital periods of <0.4 d and with outer separations of ≳1000 au. All of these systems but one are newly discovered by this work, and we catalogue their orbital information measured from their light curves. We find that the occurrence rate of 2 + 2 quadruples is 7.3 ± 2.6 times higher than what is expected from random pairings of field stars. At most a factor of ~2 enhancement may be explained by the age and metallicity dependence of the eclipsing binary fraction in the field stellar population. The remaining factor of ~3 represents a genuine enhancement of the production of short-period binaries in wide-separation (>10<SUP>3</SUP> au) pairs, suggesting a close-binary formation channel that may be enhanced by the presence of wide companions.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.3881F
An analytical, fully relativistic framework for tidal disruption event streams in Schwarzschild geometry;;We present an analytical and fully relativistic framework for studying the self-intersection of tidal disruption event (TDE) streams, restricting ourselves to the Schwarzschild spacetime. By taking advantage of the closed-form solution to the geodesic equations in the Schwarzschild metric, we calculate properties of the self-intersection without numerically evaluating the geodesic equations or making any post-Newtonian approximations. Our analytical treatment also facilitates geometric definitions of the orbital semimajor axis and eccentricity, as opposed to Newtonian formulas which lead to unphysical results for highly relativistic orbits. Combined with assumptions about energy dissipation during the self-intersection shock, our framework enables the calculation of quantities such as the fraction of material unbound during the self-intersection shock, and the characteristic semimajor axes and eccentricities of the material that remains in orbit after the collision. As an example, we calculate grids of post-intersection properties in stellar and supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses for disruptions of main-sequence stars, identifying regions where no material is ejected during self-intersection (e.g. SMBH mass $\lesssim 5\times 10^6\, {\rm M_\odot }$ for $1\, {\rm M_\odot }$ stars disrupted at the tidal radius), potentially explaining the TDEs observed by SGR/eROSITA that are visible in X-rays but not optical wavelengths. We also identify parameters for which the post-intersection accretion flow has low eccentricity (e ≲ 0.6), and find that the luminosity generated by self-intersection shocks only agrees with observed trends in the relationship between light curve decay time-scales and peak luminosities over a narrow range of SMBH masses.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.3408D
The role of plasma instabilities in relativistic radiation-mediated shocks: stability analysis and particle-in-cell simulations;;Relativistic radiation-mediated shocks are likely formed in prodigious cosmic explosions. The structure and emission of such shocks are regulated by copious production of electron-positron pairs inside the shock-transition layer. It has been pointed out recently that substantial abundance of positrons inside the shock leads to a velocity separation of the different plasma constituents, which is expected to induce a rapid growth of plasma instabilities. In this paper, we study the hierarchy of plasma microinstabilities growing in an electron-ion plasma loaded with pairs and subject to a radiation force. Linear stability analysis indicates that such a system is unstable to the growth of various plasma modes which ultimately become dominated by a current filamentation instability driven by the relative drift between the ions and the pairs. These results are validated by particle-in-cell simulations that further probe the non-linear regime of the instabilities, and the pair-ion coupling in the microturbulent electromagnetic field. Based on this analysis, we derive a reduced-transport equation for the particles via pitch-angle scattering in the microturbulence and demonstrate that it can couple the different species and lead to non-adiabatic compression via a Joule-like heating. The heating of the pairs and, conceivably, the formation of non-thermal distributions, arising from the microturbulence, can affect the observed shock-breakout signal in ways unaccounted for by current single-fluid models.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.3034V
Accretion disc sizes from continuum reverberation mapping of AGN selected from the ZTF survey;;We present the accretion disc-size estimates for a sample of 19 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using the optical g-, r-, and i-band light curves obtained from the Zwicky Transient Facility survey. All the AGNs have reliable supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass estimates based on previous reverberation mapping measurements. The multiband light curves are cross-correlated, and the reverberation lag is estimated using the Interpolated Cross-Correlation Function method and the Bayesian method using the JAVELIN code. As expected from the disc-reprocessing arguments, the g - r band lags are shorter than the g - i band lags for this sample. The interband lags for all, but five sources, are larger than the sizes predicted from the standard Shakura Sunyaev (SS) analytical model. We fit the light curves directly using a thin disc model implemented through the JAVELIN code to get the accretion disc sizes. The disc sizes obtained using this model are on an average 3.9 times larger than the prediction based on the SS disc model. We find a weak correlation between the disc sizes and the known physical parameters, namely the luminosity and the SMBH mass. In the near future, a large sample of AGNs covering broader ranges of luminosity and SMBH mass from large photometric surveys would be helpful in a better understanding of the structure and physics of the accretion disc.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.3005J
Tidal disruption events in post-starburst galaxies: the importance of a complete stellar mass function;;A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a star is destroyed by the strong tidal shear of a massive black hole (MBH). The accumulation of TDE observations over the last years has revealed that post-starburst galaxies are significantly overrepresented in the sample of TDE hosts. Here we address the post-starburst preference by investigating the decline of TDE rates in a Milky-Way like nuclear stellar cluster featuring either a monochromatic (1 $\, \mathrm{M}{\odot {}}$) or a complete, evolved stellar mass function. In the former case, the decline of TDE rates with time is very mild, and generally up to a factor of a few in 10 Gyr. Conversely, if a complete mass function is considered, a strong TDE burst over the first 0.1-1 Gyr is followed by a considerable rate drop, by at least an order of magnitude over 10 Gyr. The decline starts after a mass segregation time-scale, and it is more pronounced assuming a more top-heavy initial mass function and/or an initially denser nucleus. Our results thus suggest that the post-starburst preference can be accounted for in realistic systems featuring a complete stellar mass function, even in moderately dense galactic nuclei. Overall, our findings support the idea that starbursting galactic nuclei are characterized by a top-heavy initial mass function; we speculate that accounting for this can reconcile the discrepancy between observed and theoretically predicted TDE rates even in quiescent galaxies.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.2885B
Mapping the cosmic expansion history from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA in synergy with DESI and SPHEREx;;The measurement of the expansion history of the Universe from the redshift unknown gravitational wave (GW) sources (dark GW sources) detectable from the network of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detectors depends on the synergy with the galaxy surveys having accurate redshift measurements over a broad redshift range, large sky coverage, and detectability of fainter galaxies.In this work, we explore the possible synergy of the LVK with the spectroscopic galaxy surveys, such as DESI and SPHEREx, to measure the cosmological parameters which are related to the cosmic expansion history and the GW bias parameters. We show that by using the 3D spatial cross-correlation between the dark GW sources and the spectroscopic galaxy samples, we can measure the value of Hubble constant with about $2{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ and $1.5{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ precision from LVK+DESI and LVK+SPHEREx, respectively within the 5 yr of observation time with $50{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ duty-cycle. Similarly, the dark energy equation of state can be measured with about $10{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ and $8{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ precision from LVK+DESI and LVK+SPHEREx, respectively. We find that due to the large sky coverage of SPHEREx than DESI, performance in constraining the cosmological parameters is better from the former than the latter. By combining Euclid along with DESI and SPHEREx, a marginal gain in the measurability of the cosmological parameters is possible from the sources at high redshift (z ≥ 0.9).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.2782C
SN 2020kyg and the rates of faint Iax supernovae from ATLAS;;We present multiwavelength follow-up observations of the ATLAS discovered faint Iax supernova SN 2020kyg that peaked at an absolute magnitude of M<SUB>g</SUB> ≈ -14.9 ± 0.2, making it another member of the faint Iax supernova population. The bolometric light curve requires only ≈7 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of radioactive <SUP>56</SUP>Ni, with an ejected mass of M<SUB>ej</SUB> ~ 0.4 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a low kinetic energy of E ≈ 0.05 ± 0.02 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg. We construct a homogeneous volume-limited sample of 902 transients observed by ATLAS within 100 Mpc during a 3.5 yr span. Using this sample, we constrain the rates of faint Iax (M<SUB>r</SUB> ≳ -16) events within 60 Mpc at $12^{+14}_{-8}{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the SN Ia rate. The overall Iax rate, at $15^{+17}_{-9}{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the Ia rate, is dominated by the low-luminosity events, with luminous SNe Iax (M<SUB>r</SUB> ≲ -17.5) like 2002cx and 2005hk, accounting for only $0.9^{+1.1}_{-0.5}{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the Ia rate (a 2σ upper limit of approximately 3 per cent). We favour the hybrid CONe WD + He star progenitor channel involving a failed deflagration of a near Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf, expected to leave a bound remnant and a surviving secondary companion, as a candidate explanation for faint Iax explosions. This scenario requires short delay times, consistent with the observed environments of SNe Iax. Furthermore, binary population synthesis calculations have suggested rates of $1\!-\!18{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$ of the SN Ia rate for this channel, consistent with our rate estimates.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.2708S
The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO): prototype performance and prospects for transient science;;The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) is an array of wide-field optical telescopes, designed to exploit new discoveries from the next generation of gravitational wave detectors (LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA), study rapidly evolving transients, and exploit multimessenger opportunities arising from neutrino and very high energy gamma-ray triggers. In addition to a rapid response mode, the array will also perform a sensitive, all-sky transient survey with few day cadence. The facility features a novel, modular design with multiple 40-cm wide-field reflectors on a single mount. In 2017 June, the GOTO collaboration deployed the initial project prototype, with 4 telescope units, at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory (ORM), La Palma, Canary Islands. Here, we describe the deployment, commissioning, and performance of the prototype hardware, and discuss the impact of these findings on the final GOTO design. We also offer an initial assessment of the science prospects for the full GOTO facility that employs 32 telescope units across two sites.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.2405S
Filling the gap between synchronized and non-synchronized sdBs in short-period sdBV+dM binaries with TESS: TIC 137608661, a new system with a well-defined rotational splitting;;TIC 137608661/TYC 4544-2658-1/FBS 0938+788 is a new sdBV+dM reflection-effect binary discovered by the TESS space mission with an orbital period of 7.21 h. In addition to the orbital frequency and its harmonics, the Fourier transform of TIC 137608661 shows many g-mode pulsation frequencies from the subdwarf B (sdB) star. The amplitude spectrum is particularly simple to interpret as we immediately see several rotational triplets of equally spaced frequencies. The central frequencies of these triplets are equally spaced in period with a mean period spacing of 270.12 s, corresponding to consecutive l = 1 modes. From the mean frequency spacing of 1.25 μHz we derive a rotation period of 4.6 d in the deep layers of the sdB star, significantly longer than the orbital period. Among the handful of sdB+dM binaries for which the sdB rotation was measured through asteroseismology, TIC 137608661 is the non-synchronized system with both the shortest orbital period and the shortest core rotation period. Only NY Vir has a shorter orbital period but it is synchronized. From a spectroscopic follow-up of TIC 137608661 we measure the radial velocities of the sdB star, determine its atmospheric parameters, and estimate the rotation rate at the surface of the star. This measurement allows us to exclude synchronized rotation also in the outer layers and suggests a differential rotation, with the surface rotating faster than the core, as found in few other similar systems. Furthermore, an analysis of the spectral energy distribution of TIC 137608661, together with a comparison between sdB pulsation properties and asteroseismic models, gives us further elements to constrain the system.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.2201S
AGN light echoes and the accretion disc self-gravity limit;;Accretion disc theory predicts that an AGN disc becomes self-gravitating and breaks up into stars at an outer radius R<SUB>sg</SUB> ≃ 12 light-days, with effectively no free parameter. We present evidence that the longest observed AGN light echoes are all close to 12 d in the AGN rest frames. These observations give a stringent test of the AGN disc theory. Further monitoring should offer insight into the formation angular momentum of the gas forming the disc. For distant AGN, observed lags significantly longer than 12 d give lower limits on their redshifts.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.1992L
Relentless and complex transits from a planetesimal debris disc;;This article reports quasi-continuous transiting events towards WD 1054-226 at d = 36.2 pc and V = 16.0 mag, based on simultaneous, high-cadence, multiwavelength imaging photometry using ULTRACAM over 18 nights from 2019 to 2020 March. The predominant period is 25.02 h and corresponds to a circular orbit with blackbody T<SUB>eq</SUB> = 323 K, where a planetary surface can nominally support liquid water. The light curves reveal remarkable night-to-night similarity, with changes on longer time-scales, and lack any transit-free segments of unocculted starlight. The most pronounced dimming components occur every 23.1 min - exactly the 65<SUP>th</SUP> harmonic of the fundamental period - with depths of up to several per cent, and no evident colour dependence. Myriad additional harmonics are present, as well as at least two transiting features with independent periods. High-resolution optical spectra are consistent with stable, photospheric absorption by multiple, refractory metal species, with no indication of circumstellar gas. Spitzer observations demonstrate a lack of detectable dust emission, suggesting that the otherwise hidden circumstellar disc orbiting WD 1054-226 may be typical of polluted white dwarfs, and detected only via favourable geometry. Future observations are required to constrain the orbital eccentricity, but even if periastron is near the Roche limit, sublimation cannot drive mass loss in refractory parent bodies, and collisional disintegration is necessary for dust production.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.1647F
Machine learning technique for morphological classification of galaxies from SDSS. II. The image-based morphological catalogs of galaxies at 0.02<z<0.1;;We applied the image-based approach with a convolutional neural network model to the sample of low-redshifts galaxies with -24<SUP>m</SUP><M<SUB>r</SUB><-19.4<SUP>m</SUP> from the SDSS DR9. We divided it into two subsamples, SDSS DR9 galaxy dataset and Galaxy Zoo 2 (GZ2) dataset, considering them as the inference and training datasets, respectively. As a result, we created the morphological catalog of 315782 galaxies at 0.02<z<0.1, where morphological five classes and 34 detailed features (bar, rings, number of spiral arms, mergers, etc.) were first defined for 216148 galaxies (inference dataset) by the image-based CNN classifier. For the rest of galaxies the initial morphological classification was re-assigned as in the GZ2 project. Our method shows the promising performance of morphological classification attaining more 93 % of accuracy for five classes morphology prediction except the cigar-shaped (75 %) and completely rounded (83 %) galaxies. Main results are presented in the catalog of 27378 completely rounded, 59194 rounded in-between, 18862 cigar-shaped, 7831 edge-on, 23119 spiral in the inference data set of the studied SDSS sample. As for the classification of galaxies by their detailed structural morphological features, our CNN model gives the accuracy in the range of 92-99 % depending on features, a number of galaxies with the given feature in the inference dataset, and the galaxy image quality. We demonstrate that implication of the CNN model with adversarial validation and adversarial image data augmentation improves classification of smaller and fainter SDSS galaxies with m<SUB>r</SUB> <17.7.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022KosNT..28a...3V
Deep-Underwater Cherenkov Detector in Lake Baikal;;Neutrino telescope Baikal-CVD is a deep-underwater Cherenkov detector of elementary particles of the 1-km<SUP>3</SUP> scale, which has been developed beginning from 2016 in Lake Baikal. The telescope is assembled from separate blocks (clusters of optical modules), which makes it possible to perform scientific research even at early stages of its development. In the 2021 configuration, the detector contains eight clusters with 2304 optical modules in total and is the largest neutrino telescope in the Northern hemisphere. The design and main characteristics of the Baikal-GVD data acquisition system are described, the problems of deep-underwater engineering associated with the development of the detector are considered, and some physical results obtained on the facility are presented;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JETP..134..399A
The SVOM mission;;The Sino-French space mission SVOM is mainly designed to detect, localize and follow-up Gamma-Ray Bursts and other high-energy transients. The satellite, to be launched mid 2023, embarks two wide-field gamma-ray instruments and two narrow-field telescopes operating at X-ray and optical wavelengths. It is complemented by a dedicated ground segment encompassing a set of wide-field optical cameras and two 1-m class follow-up telescopes. In this contribution, we describe the main characteristics of the mission and discuss its scientific rationale and some original GRB studies that it will enable.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022IJMPD..3130008A
Generalised Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes in f(R) gravity;;In this manuscript, we construct generalized Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes in the context of f(R) modified theories of gravity. We consider that the matter driving the wormhole satisfies the energy conditions so that it is the effective energy-momentum tensor containing the higher-order derivatives of curvature terms that violate the null energy condition. Thus, the gravitational fluid is interpreted by the higher-order derivatives of curvature terms to represent the wormhole geometries and is fundamentally different from its counter representation in general relativity. In particular, we explore the wormhole geometries by presuming various well-known forms of Lagrangian f(R). In addition, for the seek of completeness, we discuss modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov, volume integral quantifier, and total gravitational energy.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022EPJC...82..280S

The First Data Release of CNIa0.02-A Complete Nearby (Redshift <0.02) Sample of Type Ia Supernova Light Curves;;The CNIa0.02 project aims to collect a complete, nearby sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) light curves, and the SNe are volume-limited with host-galaxy redshifts z <SUB>host</SUB> < 0.02. The main scientific goal is to infer the distributions of key properties (e.g., the luminosity function) of local SNe Ia in a complete and unbiased fashion in order to study SN explosion physics. We spectroscopically classify any SN candidate detected by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) that reaches a peak brightness <16.5 mag. Since ASAS-SN scans the full sky and does not target specific galaxies, our target selection is effectively unbiased by host-galaxy properties. We perform multiband photometric observations starting from the time of discovery. In the first data release (DR1), we present the optical light curves obtained for 247 SNe from our project (including 148 SNe in the complete sample), and we derive parameters such as the peak fluxes, Δm <SUB>15</SUB>, and s <SUB>BV</SUB> . <SUP>*</SUP> This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..259...53C
The Nascent Milliquasar VT J154843.06+220812.6: Tidal Disruption Event or Extreme Accretion State Change?;;We present a detailed multiwavelength follow-up of the nuclear radio flare VT J154843.06+220812.6, hereafter VT J1548. VT J1548 was selected as a ~1 mJy radio flare in 3 GHz observations from the Very Large Array Sky Survey. It is located in the nucleus of a low-mass ( $\mathrm{log}{M}_{\mathrm{BH}}/{M}_{\odot }\sim 6$ ) host galaxy with weak or no past active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity. VT J1548 is associated with a slow rising (multiple year), bright mid-IR flare in the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer survey, peaking at ~10%L <SUB>edd.</SUB>. No associated optical transient is detected, although we cannot rule out a short, early optical flare given the limited data available. Constant late-time (~3 yr post-flare) X-ray emission is detected at ~10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The radio spectral energy distribution is consistent with synchrotron emission from an outflow incident on an asymmetric medium. A follow-up, optical spectrum shows transient, bright, high-ionization coronal line emission ([Fe X I] λ6375, [Fe X I] λ7894, [S X I I] λ7612). Transient broad Hα is also detected but without corresponding broad Hβ emission, suggesting high nuclear extinction. We interpret this event as either a tidal disruption event or an extreme flare of an AGN, in both cases obscured by a dusty torus. Although these individual properties have been observed in previous transients, the combination is unprecedented. This event highlights the importance of searches across all wave bands for assembling a sample of nuclear flares that spans the range of observable properties and possible triggers.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...929..184S
Is the High-energy Neutrino Event IceCube-200530A Associated with a Hydrogen-rich Superluminous Supernova?;;The Zwicky Transient Facility follow-up campaign of alerts released by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has led to the likely identification of the transient AT2019fdr as the source of the neutrino event IC200530A. AT2019fdr was initially suggested to be a tidal disruption event in a Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy. However, the combination of its spectral properties, color evolution, and feature-rich light curve suggests that AT2019fdr may be a Type IIn superluminous supernova. In the latter scenario, IC200530A may have been produced via inelastic proton-proton collisions between the relativistic protons accelerated at the forward shock and the cold protons of the circumstellar medium. Here, we investigate this possibility and find that at most 4.6 × 10<SUP>-2</SUP> muon neutrino and antineutrino events are expected to be detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory within 394 days of discovery in the case of excellent discrimination of the atmospheric background. After correcting for the Eddington bias, which occurs when a single cosmic neutrino event is adopted to infer the neutrino emission at the source, we conclude that IC200530A may originate from the hydrogen-rich superluminous supernova AT2019fdr.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...929..163P
Effects of an Immortal Stellar Population in AGN Disks;;Stars are likely embedded in the gas disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Theoretical models predict that in the inner regions of the disk, these stars accrete rapidly, with fresh gas replenishing hydrogen in their cores faster than it is burned into helium, effectively stalling their evolution at hydrogen burning. We produce order-of-magnitude estimates of the number of such stars in a fiducial AGN disk. We find numbers of order 10<SUP>2-4</SUP>, confined to the inner r <SUB>cap</SUB> ~ 3000r <SUB> s </SUB> ~ 0.03 pc. These stars can profoundly alter the chemistry of AGN disks, enriching them in helium and depleting them in hydrogen, both by order-unity amounts. We further consider mergers between these stars and other disk objects, suggesting that star-star mergers result in rapid mass loss from the remnant to restore an equilibrium mass, while star-compact object mergers may result in exotic outcomes and even host binary black hole mergers within themselves. Finally, we examine how these stars react as the disk dissipates toward the end of its life, and find that they may return mass to the disk fast enough to extend its lifetime by a factor of several and/or may drive powerful outflows from the disk. Post-AGN, these stars rapidly lose mass and form a population of stellar mass black holes around 10M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Due to the complex and uncertain interactions between embedded stars and the disk, their plausible ubiquity, and their order-unity impact on disk structure and evolution, they must be included in realistic disk models.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...929..133J
EXORCISM: A Spectroscopic Survey of Young Eruptive Variables (EXor and Candidates);;We present an optical/near-IR survey of 11 variable young stars (EXors and EXor candidates) aimed at deriving and monitoring their accretion properties. About 30 optical and near-infrared spectra ( ${\mathfrak{R}}\sim 1500\mbox{--}2000$ ) were collected between 2014 and 2019 with the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). From the spectral analysis we have derived the accretion luminosity (L <SUB>acc</SUB> ) and mass accretion rate ( ${\dot{M}}_{\mathrm{acc}}$ ), the visual extinction (A <SUB>V</SUB>), the temperature and density of the permitted line formation region (T, n <SUB>H</SUB>), and the signature of the outflowing matter. Two sources (ASASSN-13db and iPTF15afq) have been observed in outburst and quiescence, three during a high level of brightness (XZ Tau, PV Cep, and NY Ori), and the others in quiescence. These latter have L <SUB>acc</SUB> and ${\dot{M}}_{\mathrm{acc}}$ in line with the values measured in classical T Tauri stars of similar mass. All sources observed more than once present L <SUB>acc</SUB> and ${\dot{M}}_{\mathrm{acc}}$ variability. The most extreme case is ASASSN-13db, for which ${\dot{M}}_{\mathrm{acc}}$ decreases by two orders of magnitude from the outburst peak in 2015 to quiescence in 2017. Also, in NY Ori L <SUB>acc</SUB> decreases by a factor 25 in one year. In 80% of the sample we detect the [O I] 6300 Å line, a tracer of mass loss. From the variability of the Hα/[O I] 6300 Å ratio, we conclude that mass accretion variations are larger than mass loss variations. From the analysis of the H I recombination lines, a correlation is suggested between the density of the line formation region, and the level of accretion activity of the source.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...929..129G
MALS SALT-NOT Survey of MIR-selected Powerful Radio-bright AGN at 0 < z < 3.5;;We present results of an optical spectroscopic survey using SALT and the Nordic Optical Telescope to build a Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mid-infrared color-based, dust-unbiased sample of powerful radio-bright (>200 mJy at 1.4 GHz) active galactic nuclei (AGN) for the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS). Our sample has 250 AGN (median z = 1.8) showing emission lines, 26 with no emission lines, and 27 without optical counterparts. Overall, our sample is fainter (Δi = 0.6 mag) and redder (Δ(g-i) = 0.2 mag) than radio-selected quasars, and representative of fainter quasar population detected in optical surveys. About 20% of the sources are narrow-line AGN (NLAGN)-65% of these, at z < 0.5 are galaxies without strong nuclear emission, and 10% at z > 1.9, have emission line ratios similar to radio galaxies. The farthest NLAGN in our sample is M1513-2524 (z <SUB>em</SUB> = 3.132), and the largest radio source (size ~330 kpc) is M0909-3133 (z <SUB>em</SUB> = 0.884). We discuss in detail 110 AGN at 1.9 < z < 3.5. Despite representing the radio loudest quasars (median R = 3685), their Eddington ratios are similar to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars having lower R. We detect four C IV broad-absorption line (BAL) QSOs, all among AGN with least R, and highest black hole masses and Eddington ratios. The BAL detection rate ( <?CDATA ${4}_{-2}^{+3}$?> %) is consistent with that seen in extremely powerful (L <SUB>1.4GHz</SUB> > 10<SUP>25</SUP> W Hz<SUP>-1</SUP>) quasars. Using optical light curves, radio polarization, and γ-ray detections, we identify seven high-probability BL Lacertae objects. We also summarize the full MALS footprint to search for H I 21 cm and OH 18 cm lines at z < 2.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...929..108G
Accretion Disk Size Measurements of Active Galactic Nuclei Monitored by the Zwicky Transient Facility;;We compile a sample of 92 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z < 0.75 with gri photometric light curves from the archival data of the Zwicky Transient Facility and measure the accretion disk sizes via continuum reverberation mapping. We employ Monte Carlo simulation tests to assess the influences of data sampling and broad emission lines and select out the sample with adequately high sampling cadences (3 days apart in average) and minimum contaminations of broad emission lines. The interband time delays of individual AGNs are calculated using the interpolated cross-correlation function, and then these delays are fitted with a generalized accretion disk model, in which interband time delays are a power function of wavelength, black hole mass, and luminosity. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is adopted to determine the best parameter values. Overall the interband time delays can be fitted with the τ ∝ λ <SUP>4/3</SUP> relation as predicted from a steady-state, optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk; however, the yielded disk size is systematically larger than expected, although the ratio of the measured to theoretical disk sizes depends on using the emissivity- or responsivity-weighted disk radius. These results are broadly consistent with previous studies, all together raising a puzzle about the "standard" accretion disk model.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...929...19G
Modeling the GRB 170202A Fireball from Continuous Observations with the Zadko and the Virgin Island Robotic Telescopes;;We present coordinated observations of GRB 170202A carried out by the Zadko and the Virgin Island Robotic Telescopes. The observations started 59 s after the event trigger, and provided nearly continuous coverage for two days, due to the unique locations of these telescopes. We clearly detected an early rise in optical emission, followed by late optical flares. By complementing these data with archival observations, we show that GRB 170202A is well described by the standard fireball model if multiple reverse shocks are taken into account. Its fireball is evidenced as expanding within a constant-density interstellar medium, with most burst parameters being consistent with the usual ranges found in the literature. The electron and magnetic energy parameters (ϵ <SUB> e </SUB>, ϵ <SUB> B </SUB>) are orders of magnitude smaller than the commonly assumed values. We argue that the global fit of the fireball model achieved by our study should be possible for any burst, pending the availability of a sufficiently comprehensive data set. This conclusion emphasizes the crucial importance of coordinated observation campaigns of gamma-ray bursts, such as the one central to this work, to answer outstanding questions about the underlying physics driving these phenomena.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...929...16G
Hubble Space Telescope Imaging of Luminous Extragalactic Infrared Transients and Variables from the Spitzer Infrared Intensive Transients Survey;;The SPitzer InfraRed Intensive Transients Survey (SPIRITS) searched for luminous infrared (IR) transients and variables in nearly 200 nearby galaxies from 2014 to 2019, using the warm Spitzer telescope at 3.6 and 4.5 μm. Among the SPIRITS variables are IR-bright objects that are undetected in ground-based optical surveys. We classify them as (1) transients, (2) periodic variables, and (3) irregular variables. The transients include eSPecially Red Intermediate-luminosity Transient Events (SPRITEs), having maximum luminosities fainter than supernovae, red IR colors, and a wide range of outburst durations (days to years). Here we report deep optical and near-IR imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) of 21 SPIRITS variables. They were initially considered SPRITE transients, but many eventually proved instead to be periodic or irregular variables as more data were collected. HST images show most of these cool and dusty variables are associated with star-forming regions in late-type galaxies, implying an origin in massive stars. Two SPRITEs lacked optical progenitors in deep preoutburst HST images; however, one was detected during eruption at J and H, indicating a dusty object with an effective temperature of ~1050 K. One faint SPRITE turned out to be a dusty classical nova. About half the HST targets proved to be periodic variables, with pulsation periods of 670-2160 days; they are likely dusty asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) stars with masses of ~5-10 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. A few of them were warm enough to be detected in deep HST frames, but most are too cool. Out of six irregular variables, two were red supergiants with optical counterparts in HST images; four were too enshrouded for HST detection. <SUP>*</SUP> Based in part on observations and archival data from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555; also in part on observations and archival data made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with NASA.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...928..158B
Dependence of Pulsation Mode of Cepheids on Metallicity;;The Cepheid variables in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the Milky Way, M33, and M31 are used to examine the dependence of pulsation mode on metallicity, which was previously found in red supergiants. The initial samples of Cepheids are collected from the Cepheid catalogs identified from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, PS1, DIRECT, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, and Zwicky Transient Facility surveys. The contaminants are removed with the help of the Gaia/EDR3 astrometric information for extra galaxies or by comparing the geometric distance and the distance from the P-L relation for the Milky Way. The division of fundamental (FU) and first-overtone (1O) modes is refined according to the gap between the two modes in the P-L diagram of the objects in each galaxy. The ratio of FU/(FU+1O) is found to be 0.59, 0.60, 0.69, 0.83, and 0.85 for the SMC, the LMC, the Milky Way, M33, and M31, respectively, in order of metallicity, which confirms that the pulsation mode depends on metallicity in the way that the ratio of FU/(FU+1O) increases with metallicity. This dependence is not changed if the incompleteness of the samples is taken into account.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...928..139Z
Optical to X-Ray Signatures of Dense Circumstellar Interaction in Core-collapse Supernovae;;Progenitors of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) can shed significant mass to circumstellar material (CSM) in the months to years preceding core collapse. The ensuing SN explosion launches ejecta that may subsequently collide with this CSM, producing shocks that can power emissions across the electromagnetic spectrum. In this work we explore the thermal signatures of dense CSM interaction when the CSM density profile is truncated at some outer radius. CSM with optical depth >c/v (where v is the shock velocity) will produce primarily ~blackbody optical/UV emission, whereas lower optical depth CSM will power bremsstrahlung X-ray emission. Focusing on the latter, we derive light curves and spectra of the resulting X-ray transients that include a detailed treatment of Comptonization. Due to strong photoelectric absorption, the X-ray light curve is dominated by the postinteraction phase that occurs after the shock reaches the CSM truncation radius. We treat this regime here for the first time. Using these results, we present the phase space of optical, UV, and X-ray transients as a function of CSM properties, and discuss detectability prospects. We find that ROSAT would not have been sensitive to CSM X-ray transients but that eROSITA is expected to detect many such events. Future wide-field UV missions such as the Ultraviolet Transient Astronomy Satellite will dramatically enhance sensitivity to large optical depth CSM configurations. Finally, we present a framework within which CSM properties may be directly inferred from observable features of X-ray transients. This can serve as an important tool for studying stellar mass loss using SN X-ray detections.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...928..122M
PGIR 20eid (SN 2020qmp): A Type IIP Supernova at 15.6 Mpc discovered by the Palomar Gattini-IR survey;;
 Aims: We present a detailed analysis of SN 2020qmp, a nearby Type IIP core-collapse supernova (CCSN) that was discovered by the Palomar Gattini-IR survey in the galaxy UGC07125 (distance of ≈15.6 ± 4 Mpc). We illustrate how the multiwavelength study of this event helps our general understanding of stellar progenitors and circumstellar medium (CSM) interactions in CCSNe. We highlight the importance of near-infrared (NIR) surveys for detections of supernovae in dusty environments. 
 Methods: We analyze data from observations in various bands: radio, NIR, optical, and X-rays. We use optical and NIR data for a spectroscopic and spectro-polarimetric study of the supernova and to model its light curve (LC). We obtain an estimate of the zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) progenitor mass from the luminosity of the [O I] doublet lines (λλ6300, 6364) normalized to the decay power of <SUP>56</SUP>Co. We also independently estimate the explosion energy and ZAMS progenitor mass through hydrodynamical LC modeling. From radio and X-ray observations, we derive the mass-loss rate and microphysical parameters of the progenitor star, and we investigate possible deviations from energy equipartition of magnetic fields and electrons in a standard CSM interaction model. Finally, we simulate a sample of CCSNe with plausible distributions of brightness and extinction, within 40 Mpc, and test what fraction of the sample is detectable at peak light by NIR surveys versus optical surveys. 
 Results: SN 2020qmp displays characteristic hydrogen lines in its optical spectra as well as a plateau in its optical LC, hallmarks of a Type IIP supernova. We do not detect linear polarization during the plateau phase, with a 3σ upper limit of 0.78%. Through hydrodynamical LC modeling and an analysis of its nebular spectra, we estimate a ZAMS progenitor mass of around 11.0 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and an explosion energy of around 0.8 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg. We find that the spectral energy distribution cannot be explained by a simple CSM interaction model, assuming a constant shock velocity and a steady mass-loss rate. In particular, the excess X-ray luminosity compared with the synchrotron radio luminosity suggests deviations from equipartition. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of NIR surveys over optical surveys for the detection of dust-obscured CCSNe in the local Universe. Specifically, our simulations show that the Wide-Field Infrared Transient Explorer will detect up to 14 more CCSNe (out of the 75 expected in its footprint) within 40 Mpc over five years than would an optical survey equivalent to the Zwicky Transient Facility. 
 Conclusions: We have determined or constrained the main properties of SN 2020qmp and its progenitor, highlighting the value of multiwavelength follow-up observations of nearby CCSNe. We have shown that forthcoming NIR surveys will enable us to improve constraints on the local CCSN rate by detecting obscured supernovae that would be missed by optical searches.

Discovery of late-time X-ray flare and anomalous emission line enhancement after the nuclear optical outburst in a narrow-line Seyfert 1 Galaxy;;CSS J102913+404220 is an atypical narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy with an energetic optical outburst occurring co-spatially with its nucleus. We present a detailed analysis of multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic observations of this object covering a period of a decade since outburst. We detect mid-infrared (MIR) flares delayed by about two months relative to the optical outburst and with an extremely high peak luminosity of L<SUB>4.6 μm</SUB> > 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>−1</SUP>. The MIR peak luminosity is at least an order of magnitude higher than any known supernovae explosions, suggesting the optical outburst might be due to a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE). We find late-time X-ray brightening by a factor of ≳30 with respect to what is observed about 100 days after the optical outburst peak, followed by a flux fading by a factor of ∼4 within two weeks, making it one of the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with extreme variability. Despite the dramatic X-ray variability, there are no coincident strong flux variations in optical, UV, and MIR bands. This unusual variability behavior has been seen in other highly accreting AGNs and could be attributed to absorption variability. In this scenario, the decrease in the covering factor of the absorber with accretion rate could cause the X-ray brightening, possibly induced by the TDE. Most strikingly, while the UV/optical continuum remains almost unchanged with time, an evident enhancement in the flux of the Hα broad emission line is observed about a decade after the nuclear optical outburst, which is an anomalous behavior never seen in any other AGN. Such an Hα anomaly could be explained by the replenishment of gas clouds and excitation within the broad line region (BLR) that perhaps originates from its interaction with outflowing stellar debris. Our results highlight the importance of the late-time evolution of a TDE, which can affect the accreting properties of the AGN, as suggested by recent simulations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...660A.119Z
WD 1145+017: Alternative models of the atmosphere, dust clouds, and gas rings;;Context. WD 1145+017 (WD1145) is the first white dwarf known to be orbited by disintegrating exoasteroids. It is a DBZ-type white dwarf with strongly variable broad circumstellar lines and variable shallow ultraviolet (UV) transits. Various models of the dust clouds and gaseous rings have been proposed as an explanation for this behavior. 
 Aims: We aim to revisit these observations and propose alternative or modified models of the atmosphere of this white dwarf, its dust clouds, and gas rings. 
 Methods: The simple radiative transfer code Shellspec was modified for this purpose and used for testing the new dust cloud and gas disk models. We used modified TLUSTY and SYNSPEC codes to calculate atmosphere models assuming the local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) or nonLTE (NLTE), and to calculate the intrinsic spectrum of the star. We then used these atmosphere models to estimate the mass of the radiative and convective zones and NLTE spectrum synthesis to estimate their chemical composition. 
 Results: We offer an alternative explanation of some (not all) shallow UV transits. These may be naturally caused by the optical properties of the dust grains: opacities and mainly phase functions as a result of the forward scattering. The latter is much stronger in UV compared to the optical region, leaving more UV photons in the original direction during the transit. We also developed an alternative model of the gaseous disk, consisting of an inner, hotter, and almost circular disk and an outer, cooler, and eccentric disk. The structure precesses with a period of 3.83 ± 0.12 yr. We demonstrate that it fits the observed circumstellar lines reasonably well. These alternative models solve a few drawbacks that might be associated with the previous models, but they also have their own disadvantages. We confirm that the chemical composition of the atmosphere is similar to that of CI chondrites but carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur are significantly underabundant and much closer to the bulk Earth composition. This is a strong argument that the star has recently encountered and accreted material from a body of Earth-like composition.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...660A..72B
Neutron Stars with Baryon Number Violation, Probing Dark Sectors;;The neutron lifetime anomaly has been used to motivate the introduction of new physics with hidden-sector particles coupled to baryon number, and on which neutron stars provide powerful constraints. Although the neutron lifetime anomaly may eventually prove to be of mundane origin, we use it as motivation for a broader review of the ways that baryon number violation, be it real or apparent, and dark sectors can intertwine and how neutron star observables, both present and future, can constrain them.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Symm...14..518B
V0644 Ser: An Active Ultrashort Period Contact Binary Star;;The photometric solutions of the ultrashort period close binary V0644 Ser based on our new complete BVRI light curves are derived by the Wilson-Devininney code. The results show that V0644 Ser is a W-type shallow contact binary, and the third light was found in the R and I bands. Compared with the light curves in 2011, the amplitude variation of the secondary maximum can be explained by the temperature change from hot to cold in the local region of the star surface caused by magnetic activity or convective instability. Combined with the Gaia parallax, the absolute parameters of this system are obtained: M <SUB>1</SUB> = 0.29(4) M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, M <SUB>2</SUB> = 0.56(9) M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, R <SUB>1</SUB> = 0.48(3) R <SUB>⊙</SUB>, R <SUB>2</SUB> = 0.65(3) R <SUB>⊙</SUB>, L <SUB>1</SUB> = 0.11(2) L <SUB>⊙</SUB>, L <SUB>2</SUB> = 0.16(2) L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. To study the period variation, we fitted the SuperWASP, CSS, ASAS-SN and ZTF survey timing data to obtain light minima times spanning 14 yr. Through O - C analysis, we find that the orbital period of this system has a long-term period decrease and periodic oscillation. The long-term period decrease can be explained by the mass transfer from more-massive component to less one and angular momentum loss via magnetic stellar wind. With the period decrease, this system is evolving from the present shallow contact phase to a relatively deeper stage predicted by the thermal relaxation oscillation theory. Periodic oscillation can be explained by the light-time effect of the cool third body. This third body may play an important role in the early formation and evolution of the binary system by removing angular momentum.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022RAA....22c5024X
Physical Properties of 29 sdB+dM Eclipsing Binaries in Zwicky Transient Facility;;The development of large-scale time-domain surveys provides an opportunity to study the physical properties as well as the evolutionary scenario of B-type subdwarfs (sdBs) and M-type dwarfs (dMs). Here, we obtained 33 sdB+dM eclipsing binaries based on the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) light curves and Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) parallaxes. By using the PHOEBE code for light curve analysis, we obtain probability distributions for parameters of 29 sdB+dMs. R <SUB>1</SUB>, R <SUB>2</SUB> and i are well determined, and the average uncertainty of mass ratio q is 0.08. Our parameters are in good agreement with previous works if a typical mass of sdB is assumed. Based on parameters of 29 sdB+dMs, we find that both the mass ratio q and the companion's radius R <SUB>2</SUB> decrease with the shortening of the orbital period. For the three sdB+dMs with orbital periods less than 0.075 days, their companions are all brown dwarfs. The masses and radii of the companions satisfy the mass-radius relation for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Companions with radii between 0.12 R <SUB>⊙</SUB> and 0.15 R <SUB>⊙</SUB> seem to be missing in the observations. As more short-period sdB+dM eclipsing binaries are discovered and classified in the future with ZTF and Gaia, we will have more information to constrain the evolutionary ending of sdB+dMs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022RAA....22c5022D
New Massive Contact Twin Binary in a Radio-quiet H II Region Associated with the M17 Complex;;Early-B stars, much less energetic than O stars, may create an H II region that appears as radio-quiet. We report the identification of new early-B stars associated with the radio-quiet H II region G014.645-00.606 in the M17 complex. The radio-quiet H II region G014.645-00.606 is adjacent to three radio-quiet WISE H II region candidates. The ionizing sources of the radio-quiet H II regions are expected to be later than B1V, given the sensitivity about 1-2 mJy of the MAGPIS 20 cm survey. The stars were first selected if their parallaxes of Gaia EDR3 match that of the 22 GHz H<SUB>2</SUB>O maser source within the same region. We used the color-magnitude diagram made from the Zwicky Transient Facility photometric catalog to select the candidates for massive stars because the intrinsic g - r colors of massive stars change little from B-type to O-type stars. Five stars lie in the areas of the color-magnitude diagram where either reddened massive stars or evolved post-main sequence stars of lower masses are commonly found. Three of the five stars, sources 1, 2, and 3, are located at the cavities of the three IR bubbles, and extended Hα emission is detected around the three IR bubbles. We suggest that sources 1, 2, and 3 are candidates for early-B stars associated with the radio-quiet region G014.645-00.606. Particularly, source 1 is an EW type eclipsing binary with a short period of 0.825 day, while source 2 is an EA type eclipsing binary with a short period of 0.919 day. The physical parameters of the two binary systems have been derived through the PHOEBE model. Source 1 is a twin binary of two stars with T <SUB>eff</SUB> ≈ 23,500 K, and source 2 contains a hotter component (T <SUB>eff</SUB> ≈ 20,100 K) and a cooler one (T <SUB>eff</SUB> ≈ 15,500 K). The O - C values of source 1 show a trend of decline, implying that the period of the source is deceasing. Source 1 is likely a contact early-B twin binary, for which mass transfer might cause its orbit to shrink.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022RAA....22c5021Y
The Population of Interstellar Objects Detectable with the LSST and Accessible for In Situ Rendezvous with Various Mission Designs;;The recently discovered population of interstellar objects presents us with the opportunity to characterize material from extrasolar planetary and stellar systems up close. The forthcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide an unprecedented increase in sensitivity to these objects compared to the capabilities of currently operational observational facilities. We generate a synthetic population of 'Oumuamua-like objects drawn from their galactic kinematics and identify the distribution of impact parameters, eccentricities, hyperbolic velocities, and sky locations of objects detectable with the LSST, assuming no cometary activity. This population is characterized by a clustering of trajectories in the direction of the solar apex and antiapex, centered at orbital inclinations of ~90°. We identify the ecliptic or solar apex as the optimal sky location to search for future interstellar objects as a function of survey limiting magnitude. Moreover, we identify the trajectories of detectable objects that will be reachable for in situ rendezvous with a dedicated mission with the capabilities of the forthcoming Comet Interceptor or proposed Bridge concept. By scaling our fractional population statistics with the inferred spatial number density, we estimate that the LSST will detect of order ~15 interstellar objects over the course of its ~10 yr observational campaign. Furthermore, we find that there should be ~1-3 and ~0.0007-0.001 reachable targets for missions with propulsion capabilities comparable to Bridge and Comet Interceptor, respectively. These numbers are lower limits and will be readily updateable when the number density and size-frequency distribution of interstellar objects are better constrained.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PSJ.....3...71H
Low-cost Access to the Deep, High-cadence Sky: the Argus Optical Array;;New mass-produced, wide-field, small-aperture telescopes have the potential to revolutionize ground-based astronomy by greatly reducing the cost of collecting area. In this paper, we introduce a new class of large telescope based on these advances: an all-sky, arcsecond-resolution, 1000 telescope array which builds a simultaneously high-cadence and deep survey by observing the entire sky all night. As a concrete example, we describe the Argus Array, a 5 m-class telescope with an all-sky field of view and the ability to reach extremely high cadences using low-noise CMOS detectors. Each 55 GPix Argus exposure covers 20% of the entire sky to m <SUB> g </SUB> = 19.6 each minute and m <SUB> g </SUB> = 21.9 each hour; a high-speed mode will allow sub-second survey cadences for short times. Deep coadds will reach m <SUB> g </SUB> = 23.6 every five nights over 47% of the sky; a larger-aperture array telescope, with an étendue close to the Rubin Observatory, could reach m <SUB> g </SUB> = 24.3 in five nights. These arrays can build two-color, million-epoch movies of the sky, enabling sensitive and rapid searches for high-speed transients, fast-radio-burst counterparts, gravitational-wave counterparts, exoplanet microlensing events, occultations by distant solar system bodies, and myriad other phenomena. An array of O(1000) telescopes, however, would be one of the most complex astronomical instruments yet built. Standard arrays with hundreds of tracking mounts entail thousands of moving parts and exposed optics, and maintenance costs would rapidly outpace the mass-produced-hardware cost savings compared to a monolithic large telescope. We discuss how to greatly reduce operations costs by placing all optics in thermally controlled, sealed domes with only a few moving parts. Coupled with careful software scope control and use of existing pipelines, we show that the Argus Array could become the deepest and fastest Northern sky survey, with total costs in the $20M range.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134c5003L
Discovery of hot subdwarfs covered with helium-burning ash;;Helium-rich subdwarf O stars (sdOs) are hot compact stars in a pre-white dwarf evolutionary state. Most of them have effective temperatures and surface gravities in the range T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 40 000-50 000 K and log g = 5.5-6.0. Their atmospheres are helium dominated. If present at all, C, N, and O are trace elements. The abundance patterns are explained in terms of nucleosynthesis during single star evolution (late helium core flash) or a binary He-core white dwarf merger. Here we announce the discovery of two hot hydrogen-deficient sdOs (PG1654+322 and PG1528+025) that exhibit unusually strong carbon and oxygen lines. A non-LTE model atmosphere analysis of spectra obtained with the Large Binocular Telescope and by the LAMOST survey reveals astonishingly high abundances of C ($\approx 20{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$) and O ($\approx 20{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$) and that the two stars are located close to the helium main sequence. Both establish a new spectroscopic class of hot H-deficient subdwarfs (CO-sdO) and can be identified as the remnants of a He-core white dwarf that accreted matter of a merging low-mass CO-core white dwarf. We conclude that the CO-sdOs represent an alternative evolutionary channel creating PG1159 stars besides the evolution of single stars that experience a late helium-shell flash.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511L..66W
Out of one, many: distinguishing time delays from lensed supernovae;;Gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae are an emerging probe with great potential for constraining dark energy, spatial curvature, and the Hubble constant. The multiple images and their time delayed and magnified fluxes may be unresolved, however, blended into a single light curve. We demonstrate methods without a fixed source template matching for extracting the individual images, determining whether there are one (no lensing) or two or four (lensed) images, and measuring the time delays between them that are valuable cosmological probes. We find 100 per cent success for determining the number of images for time delays greater than ~10 d.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.1210D
Supernova siblings and their parent galaxies in the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey;;Supernova (SN) siblings - two or more SNe in the same parent galaxy - are useful tools for exploring progenitor stellar populations as well as properties of the host galaxies such as distance, star-formation rate, dust extinction, and metallicity. Since the average SN rate for a Milky Way-type galaxy is just one per century, a large imaging survey is required to discover an appreciable sample of SN siblings. From the wide-field Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey (which aims for spectroscopic completeness for all transients which peak brighter than r < 18.5 mag) we present 10 SN siblings in five parent galaxies. For each of these families, we analyse the SN's location within the host and its underlying stellar population, finding agreement with expectations that SNe from more massive progenitors are found nearer to their host core and in regions of more active star formation. We also present an analysis of the relative rates of core collapse and thermonuclear SN siblings, finding a significantly lower ratio than past SN sibling samples due to the unbiased nature of the ZTF.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511..241G
TOI-530b: a giant planet transiting an M-dwarf detected by TESS;;We report the discovery of TOI-530b, a transiting Saturn-like planet around an M0.5V dwarf, delivered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The host star is located at a distance of 147.7 ± 0.6 pc with a radius of R<SUB>*</SUB> = 0.54 ± 0.03 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a mass of M<SUB>*</SUB> = 0.53 ± 0.02 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We verify the planetary nature of the transit signals by combining ground-based multiwavelength photometry, high-resolution spectroscopy from SPIRou as well as high-angular-resolution imaging. With V = 15.4 mag, TOI-530b is orbiting one of the faintest stars accessible by ground-based spectroscopy. Our model reveals that TOI-530b has a radius of 0.83 ± 0.05 R<SUB>J</SUB> and a mass of 0.37 ± 0.08 M<SUB>J</SUB> on a 6.39-d orbit. TOI-530b is the sixth transiting giant planet hosted by an M-type star, which is predicted to be infrequent according to core accretion theory, making it a valuable object to further study the formation and migration history of similar planets. Furthermore, we identify a potential dearth of hot massive giant planets around M-dwarfs with separation distance smaller than 0.1 au and planet-to-star mass ratio between 2 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> and 10<SUP>-2</SUP>. We also find a possible correlation between hot giant planet formation and the metallicity of its parent M-dwarf. We discuss the potential formation channel of such systems.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511...83G
SkyMapper colours of Seyfert galaxies and changing-look AGN - II. Newly discovered changing-look AGN;;Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGN) are AGN that change type as their broad emission lines appear or disappear, which is usually accompanied by strong flux changes in their blue featureless continuum. We search for turn-on CLAGN by selecting type-2 AGN from the spectroscopic Six-degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS), whose colours, observed ~15 yr later by the SkyMapper Southern Survey, are suggestive of type-1 AGN. Starting from 1092 type-2 AGN, we select 20 candidates for follow-up and confirm that 14 of them have changed into type-1 and are thus turn-on CLAGN; further observations reveal 11 more turn-on CLAGN. While our search was not tailored to efficiently discover turn-off CLAGN, we discover two such cases as well. The result suggests a turn-on CLAGN rate of over 3 per cent over ~15 yr and imply a total CLAGN rate of more than ~6 per cent over this period. Finally, we present observations of AGN that are atypical for the CLAGN phenomenology, including J1109146 - a type-1 that did not appear as an AGN at all in 6dFGS; J1406507 - the second reported changing-look narrow-line Seyfert 1; and J1340153 - a CLAGN with a change time-scale of 3 months.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511...54H

Type Ia supernova magnitude step from the local dark matter environment;;Residuals in the Hubble diagram at optical wavelengths and host galaxy stellar mass are observed to correlate in type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) ('magnitude step'). Among possible progenitor channels for the associated explosions, those based on dark matter (DM) have attracted significant attention, including our recent proposal that 'normal' SNe Ia from bare detonations in sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarf stars are triggered by the passage of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs): the magnitude step could then originate from a brightness dependence on stellar properties, on DM properties, or both. Here, we present a method to estimate the local DM density and velocity dispersion of the environment of SN Ia progenitors. We find a luminosity step of $0.52\pm 0.11\,$ mag corresponding to bins of high versus low DM density in a sample of 222 low-redshift events from The Open Supernova Catalog. We investigate whether the magnitude step can be attributed to local DM properties alone, assuming asteroid-mass PBHs. Given the inverse correlation between SN Ia brightness and PBH mass, an intriguing explanation is a spatially inhomogeneous PBH mass function. If so, a strong mass segregation in the DM density-dependent PBH mass scale is needed to explain the magnitude step. While mass segregation is observed in dense clusters, it is unlikely to be realized on galactic scales. Therefore, if DM consists of asteroid-mass PBHs, the magnitude step is more likely to exist, and dominantly to be attributed to local stellar properties.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.4779S
Optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of Nova V2891 Cygni: evidence for shock-induced dust formation;;We present multi-epoch optical and near-infrared observations of the highly reddened, Fe II class slow Nova V2891 Cygni. The observations span 15 months since its discovery. The initial rapid brightening from quiescence, and the presence of an ~35-d long pre-maximum halt, is well documented. The evidence that the current outburst of V2891 Cyg has undergone several distinct episodes of mass ejection is seen through time-varying P Cygni profiles of the O I 7773 Å line. A highlight is the occurrence of a dust formation event centred around approximately +273 d, which coincides with a phase of coronal line emission. The dust mass is found to be $\sim\!{0.83{-}1.25} \times 10^{-10}\ \mathrm{M}_{\odot }$. There is strong evidence to suggest that the coronal lines are created by shock heating rather than by photoionization. The simultaneous occurrence of the dust and coronal lines (with varying velocity shifts) supports the possibility that dust formation is shock induced. Such a route for dust formation has not previously been seen in a nova, although the mechanism has been proposed for dust formation in some core-collapse supernovae. Analysis of the coronal lines indicates a gas mass and temperature of 8.35-8.42 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and ~(4.8-9.1) × 10<SUP>5</SUP> K, respectively, and an overabundance of aluminium and silicon. A Case B analysis of the hydrogen lines yields a mass of the ionized gas of (8.60 ± 1.73) × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The reddening and distance to the nova are estimated to be E(B - V) = 2.21 ± 0.15 and d = 5.50 kpc, respectively.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.4265K
Accretion-induced merger leading to core-collapse supernovae in old stellar populations;;We examine a triple-star evolution that might lead to core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) in stellar populations that are too old to allow for single or binary evolution to form CCSNe, i.e. where the most massive stars that evolve off the main sequence have masses of $\simeq 4\!-\!5\, {\rm M}_\odot$. In the scenario we examine the most massive star in the triple system, of mass $\simeq 4\!-\!5\, {\rm M}_\odot$, transfers mass to an inner binary system at an orbital separation of $\simeq 100\!-\!1000\, {\rm R}_\odot$. The initial orbital separation of the inner binary is $\simeq 10\!-\!50\, {\rm R}_\odot$. The inner binary accretes most of the mass that the primary star loses and the two stars expand and their mutual orbit contracts until merger. The merger product is a main-sequence star of mass $\simeq 8\!-\!10\, {\rm M}_\odot$ that later experiences a CCSN explosion and leaves a neutron star (NS) remnant, bound or unbound to the white dwarf (WD) remnant of the primary star. We estimate the event rate of this WD-NS reverse evolution scenario to be a fraction of ≈5 × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> of all CCSNe. We expect that in the coming decade sky surveys will detect one to five such events.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.4242B
Transients from ONe white dwarf - neutron star/black hole mergers;;We conduct the first 3D hydrodynamic simulations of oxygen-neon white dwarf-neutron star/black hole mergers (ONe WD-NS/BH mergers). Such mergers constitute a significant fraction, and may even dominate, the inspiral rates of all WD-NS binaries. We post-process our simulations to obtain the nuclear evolution of these systems and couple the results to a supernova spectral synthesis code to obtain the first light curves and spectra for these transients. We find that the amount of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni synthesized in these mergers grows as a strong function of the WD mass, reaching typically 0.05 and up to $0.1\, {\rm M}_\odot$ per merger. Photodisintegration leads to similar amounts of <SUP>4</SUP>He and about a ten times smaller amount of <SUP>1</SUP>H. The nuclear yields from these mergers, in particular those of <SUP>55</SUP>Mn, may contribute significantly to Galactic chemical evolution. The transients expected from ONe WD-NS mergers are dominantly red/infrared, evolve on month-long time-scales and reach bolometric magnitudes of up to -16.5. The current surveys must have already detected these transients or are, alternatively, putting strong constraints on merger scenarios. The properties of the expected transients from WD-NS mergers best agree with faint type Iax supernovae. The Vera Rubin Observatory (LSST) will be detecting up to thousands of merging ONe WD-NS systems per year. We simulate a subset of our models with 2D axisymmetric FLASH code to investigate why they have been challenging for previous studies. We find that the likely main challenge has been effectively modelling the nuclear statistical equilibrium regime in such mergers.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.3758B
Identifying RR Lyrae in the ZTF DR3 data set;;We present an RR Lyrae (RRL) catalogue based on the combination of the third data release of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF DR3) and Gaia EDR3. We use a multistep classification pipeline relying on the Fourier decomposition fitting to the multiband ZTF light curves and random forest classification. The resulting catalogue contains 71 755 RRLs with period and light-curve parameter measurements and has a completeness of 0.92 and a purity of 0.92 with respect to the Specific Objects Study Gaia DR2 RRLs. The catalogue covers the Northern sky with declination ≥-28°, its completeness is ≳0.8 for heliocentric distance ≤80 kpc, and the most distant RRL is at 132 kpc. Compared with several other RRL catalogues covering the Northern sky, our catalogue has more RRLs around the Galactic halo and is more complete at low-Galactic latitude areas. Analysing the spatial distribution of RRL in the catalogue reveals the previously known major overdensities of the Galactic halo, such as the Virgo overdensity and the Hercules-Aquila Cloud, with some evidence of an association between the two. We also analyse the Oosterhoff fraction differences throughout the halo, comparing it with the density distribution, finding increasing Oosterhoff I fraction at the elliptical radii between 16 and 32 kpc and some evidence of different Oosterhoff fractions across various halo substructures.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.3575H
A multi-method approach to constrain the age of eruption and post-depositional processes in a Lower Jurassic ignimbrite from the Marifil Volcanic Complex, eastern North Patagonian Massif;;In the eastern North Patagonian Massif, the Marifil Volcanic Complex corresponds to an Early Jurassic magmatic event. In this study, we evaluate new geochronological and thermochronological data obtained from an ignimbrite of the complex. U-Pb zircon ages from the pumice fraction reveal a Concordia age of 184.4 ± 1.1 Ma. Conversely, U-Pb zircon ages from the whole-rock sample evidence a Concordia age of 190.4 ± 0.6 Ma. Fission track techniques were applied on the same whole-rock sample. Zircon fission track performed on the same zircon-crystals dated by U-Pb yielded an age of 172.5 ± 8.1 Ma, while apatite fission track evidenced a cooling age of 179.1 ± 13.5 Ma. Apatite and zircon crystals describe uniform morphologies with unaltered euhedral to subhedral grains and well-developed crystalline forms. The results suggest that the age of eruption and deposition of the ignimbrite is better explained by the pumice zircon age rather than the whole-rock zircon age. Inherited grain-ages and petrographic evidence support provenance from older, probably cogenetic, magmatic products. Fission track ages reflect a post-depositional process probably related to diagenetic mineral changes.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JSAES.11403688G
J/ψ polarization in semi-inclusive DIS at low and high transverse momentum;;We study the polar and azimuthal decay angular distributions of J/ψ mesons produced in semi-inclusive, deep-inelastic electron-proton scattering. For the description of the quarkonium formation mechanism, we adopt the framework of nonrelativistic QCD, with the inclusion of the intermediate color-octet channels that are suppressed at most by a factor v<SUP>4</SUP> in the velocity parameter v relative to the leading color-singlet channel. We put forward factorized expressions for the helicity structure functions in terms of transverse momentum dependent gluon distributions and shape functions, which are valid when the J/ψ transverse momentum is small with respect to the hard scale of the process. By requiring that such expressions correctly match with the collinear factorization results at high transverse momentum, we determine the perturbative tails of the shape functions and find them to be independent of the J/ψ polarization. In particular, we focus on the cos 2ϕ azimuthal decay asymmetry, which originates from the distribution of linearly polarized gluons inside an unpolarized proton. We therefore suggest a novel experiment for the extraction of this so-far unknown parton density that could be performed, in principle, at the future Electron-Ion Collider.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JHEP...03..037D
Linking Extragalactic Transients and Their Host Galaxy Properties: Transient Sample, Multiwavelength Host Identification, and Database Construction;;Understanding the preferences of transient types for host galaxies with certain characteristics is key to studies of transient physics and galaxy evolution, as well as to transient identification and classification in the LSST era. Here we describe a value-added database of extragalactic transients-supernovae, tidal disruption events, gamma-ray bursts, and other rare events-and their host galaxy properties. Based on reported coordinates, redshifts, and host galaxies (if known) of events, we cross-identify their host galaxies or most likely host candidates in various value-added or survey catalogs, and compile the existing photometric, spectroscopic, and derived physical properties of the host galaxies in these catalogs. This new database covers photometric measurements from the far-ultraviolet to mid-infrared. Spectroscopic measurements and derived physical properties are also available for a smaller subset of hosts. For our 36,333 unique events, we have cross-identified 13,753 host galaxies using host names, plus 4480 using host coordinates. Besides those with known hosts, there are 18,100 transients with newly identified host candidates. This large database will allow explorations of the connections of transients to their hosts, including a path toward transient alert filtering and probabilistic classification based on host properties.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..259...13Q
A Catalog of LAMOST Variable Sources Based on Time-domain Photometry of ZTF;;The identification and analysis of different variable sources is a hot topic in astrophysical research. The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) spectroscopic survey has accumulated a mass of spectral data but contains no information about variable sources. Although a few related studies present variable source catalogs for the LAMOST, the studies still have a few deficiencies regarding the type and number of variable sources identified. In this study, we present a statistical modeling approach to identify variable source candidates. We first cross-match the Kepler, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and Zwicky Transient Facility catalogs to obtain light-curve data of variable and nonvariable sources. The data are then modeled statistically using commonly used variability parameters. Then, an optimal variable source identification model is determined using the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and four credible evaluation indices such as precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Based on this identification model, a catalog of LAMOST variable sources (including 631,769 variable source candidates with a probability greater than 95%, and so on) is obtained. To validate the correctness of the catalog, we perform a two-by-two cross-comparison with the Gaia catalog and other published variable source catalogs. We achieve the correct rate ranging from 50% to 100%. Among the 123,756 sources cross-matched, our variable source catalog identifies 85,669 with a correct rate of 69%, which indicates that the variable source catalog presented in this study is credible.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..259...11X
AT 2019avd: A Tidal Disruption Event with a Two-phase Evolution;;Tidal disruption events (TDEs) can uncover the quiescent supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies and also offer a promising method to study them. After the disruption of a star by an SMBH, the highly elliptical orbit of the debris stream will be gradually circularized due to the self-crossing, and then the circularized debris will form an accretion disk. The recent TDE candidate AT 2019avd has double peaks in its optical light curve, and the X-ray emerges near the second peak. The durations of the peaks are ~400 and 600 days, respectively, and the separation between them is ~700 days. We fit its spectral energy distribution and analyze its light curves in the optical/UV, mid-infrared, and X-ray bands. We find that this source can be interpreted as a two-phase scenario in which the first phase is dominated by the stream circularization, and the second phase is the delayed accretion. We use the succession of the self-crossing model and delayed accretion model to fit the first and second peaks, respectively. The fitting result implies that AT 2019avd can be interpreted by the partial disruption of a 0.9 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> star by a 7 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> SMBH, but this result is sensitive to the stellar model. Furthermore, we find that the large-amplitude (by factors up to ~5) X-ray variability in AT 2019avd can be interpreted as the rigid-body precession of the misaligned disk due to the Lense-Thirring effect of a spinning SMBH, with a precession period of 10-25 days.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...928...63C
New Variable Hot Subdwarf Stars Identified from Anomalous Gaia Flux Errors, Observed by TESS, and Classified via Fourier Diagnostics;;Hot subdwarf stars are mostly stripped red giants that can exhibit photometric variations due to stellar pulsations, eclipses, the reflection effect, ellipsoidal modulation, and Doppler beaming. Detailed studies of their light curves help constrain stellar parameters through asteroseismological analyses or binary light-curve modeling and generally improve our capacity to draw a statistically meaningful picture of this enigmatic stage of stellar evolution. From an analysis of Gaia DR2 flux errors, we have identified around 1200 candidate hot subdwarfs with inflated flux errors for their magnitudes-a strong indicator of photometric variability. As a pilot study, we obtained 2 minute cadence TESS Cycle 2 observations of 187 candidate hot subdwarfs with anomalous Gaia flux errors. More than 90% of our targets show significant photometric variations in their TESS light curves. Many of the new systems found are cataclysmic variables, but we report the discovery of several new variable hot subdwarfs, including HW Vir binaries, reflection-effect systems, pulsating sdBV<SUB> s </SUB> stars, and ellipsoidally modulated systems. We determine atmospheric parameters for select systems using follow-up spectroscopy from the 3 m Shane telescope. Finally, we present a Fourier diagnostic plot for classifying binary light curves using the relative amplitudes and phases of their fundamental and harmonic signals in their periodograms. This plot makes it possible to identify certain types of variables efficiently, without directly investigating their light curves, and may assist in the rapid classification of systems observed in large photometric surveys.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...928...20B
Revisiting the Rates and Demographics of Tidal Disruption Events: Effects of the Disk Formation Efficiency;;Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are valuable probes of the demographics of supermassive black holes as well as the dynamics and population of stars in the centers of galaxies. In this Letter, we focus on studying how debris disk formation and circularization processes can impact the possibility of observing prompt flares in TDEs. First, we investigate how the efficiency of disk formation is determined by the key parameters, namely, the black hole mass M <SUB>BH</SUB>, the stellar mass m <SUB>⋆</SUB>, and the orbital penetration parameter β that quantifies how close the disrupted star would orbit around the black hole. Then we calculate the intrinsic differential TDE rate as a function of these three parameters. Combining these two results, we find that the rates of TDEs with prompt disk formation are significantly suppressed around lighter black holes, which provides a plausible explanation for why the observed TDE host black hole mass distribution peaks between 10<SUP>6</SUP> and 10<SUP>7</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Therefore, the consideration of disk formation efficiency is crucial for recovering the intrinsic black hole demographics from TDEs. Furthermore, we find that the efficiency of the disk formation process also impacts the distributions of both stellar orbital penetration parameter and stellar mass observed in TDEs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927L..19W
Revealing the Field Sub-subgiant Population Using a Catalog of Active Giant Stars and Gaia EDR3;;Sub-subgiant stars (SSGs) fall below the subgiant branch and/or red of the giant branch in open and globular clusters, an area of the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) not populated by standard stellar evolution tracks. One hypothesis is that SSGs result from rapid rotation in subgiants or giants due to tidal synchronization in a close binary. The strong magnetic fields generated inhibit convection, which in turn produces large starspots, radius inflation, and lower-than-expected average surface temperatures and luminosities. Here we cross-reference a catalog of active giant binaries (RS CVns) in the field with Gaia EDR3. Using the Gaia photometry and parallaxes, we precisely position the RS CVns in a CMD. We identify stars that fall below a 14 Gyr, metal-rich isochrone as candidate field SSGs. Out of a sample of 1723 RS CVn, we find 448 SSG candidates, a dramatic expansion from the 65 SSGs previously known. Most SSGs have rotation periods of 2-20 days, with the highest SSG fraction found among RS CVn with the shortest periods. The ubiquity of SSGs among this population indicates that SSGs are a normal phase in evolution for RS CVn-type systems, not rare by-products of dynamical encounters found only in dense star clusters as some have suggested. We present our catalog of 1723 active giants, including Gaia photometry and astrometry, and rotation periods from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and International Variable Star Index (VSX). This catalog can serve as an important sample to study the impacts of magnetic fields in evolved stars.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..222L
Identifying Lensed Quasars and Measuring Their Time Delays from Unresolved Light Curves;;Identifying multiply imaged quasars is challenging owing to their low density in the sky and the limited angular resolution of wide-field surveys. We show that multiply imaged quasars can be identified using unresolved light curves, without assuming a light-curve template or any prior information. After describing our method, we show, using simulations, that it can attain high precision and recall when we consider high-quality data with negligible noise well below the variability of the light curves. As the noise level increases to that of the Zwicky Transient Facility telescope, we find that precision can remain close to 100% while recall drops to ~60%. We also consider some examples from Time Delay Challenge 1 and demonstrate that the time delays can be accurately recovered from the joint light-curve data in realistic observational scenarios. We further demonstrate our method by applying it to publicly available COSMOGRAIL data of the observed lensed quasar SDSS J1226-0006. We identify the system as a lensed quasar based on the unresolved light curve and estimate a time delay in good agreement with the one measured by COSMOGRAIL using the individual image light curves. The technique shows great potential to identify lensed quasars in wide-field imaging surveys, especially the soon-to-be-commissioned Vera Rubin Observatory.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..191B
The Type Icn SN 2021csp: Implications for the Origins of the Fastest Supernovae and the Fates of Wolf-Rayet Stars;;We present observations of SN 2021csp, the second example of a newly identified type of supernova (SN) hallmarked by strong, narrow, P Cygni carbon features at early times (Type Icn). The SN appears as a fast and luminous blue transient at early times, reaching a peak absolute magnitude of -20 within 3 days due to strong interaction between fast SN ejecta (v ≈ 30,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) and a massive, dense, fast-moving C/O wind shed by the WC-like progenitor months before explosion. The narrow-line features disappear from the spectrum 10-20 days after explosion and are replaced by a blue continuum dominated by broad Fe features, reminiscent of Type Ibn and IIn supernovae and indicative of weaker interaction with more extended H/He-poor material. The transient then abruptly fades ~60 days post-explosion when interaction ceases. Deep limits at later phases suggest minimal heavy-element nucleosynthesis, a low ejecta mass, or both, and imply an origin distinct from that of classical Type Ic SNe. We place SN 2021csp in context with other fast-evolving interacting transients, and discuss various progenitor scenarios: an ultrastripped progenitor star, a pulsational pair-instability eruption, or a jet-driven fallback SN from a Wolf-Rayet (W-R) star. The fallback scenario would naturally explain the similarity between these events and radio-loud fast transients, and suggests a picture in which most stars massive enough to undergo a W-R phase collapse directly to black holes at the end of their lives.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..180P
Kilonova Detectability with Wide-field Instruments;;Kilonovae are ultraviolet, optical, and infrared transients powered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements following a neutron star merger. Joint observations of kilonovae and gravitational waves can offer key constraints on the source of Galactic r-process enrichment, among other astrophysical topics. However, robust constraints on heavy element production require rapid kilonova detection (within ~1 day of merger) as well as multiwavelength observations across multiple epochs. In this study, we quantify the ability of 13 wide-field-of-view instruments to detect kilonovae, leveraging a large grid of over 900 radiative transfer simulations with 54 viewing angles per simulation. We consider both current and upcoming instruments, collectively spanning the full kilonova spectrum. The Roman Space Telescope has the highest redshift reach of any instrument in the study, observing kilonovae out to z ~ 1 within the first day post-merger. We demonstrate that BlackGEM, DECam, GOTO, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST, ULTRASAT, VISTA, and WINTER can observe some kilonovae out to z ~ 0.1 (~475 Mpc), while DDOTI, MeerLICHT, PRIME, Swift/UVOT, and ZTF are confined to more nearby observations. Furthermore, we provide a framework to infer kilonova ejecta properties following nondetections and explore variation in detectability with these ejecta parameters.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..163C
The Pulsating Helium-atmosphere White Dwarfs. I. New DBVs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey;;We present a dedicated search for new pulsating helium-atmosphere (DBV) white dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey using the McDonald 2.1 m Otto Struve Telescope. In total we observed 55 DB and DBA white dwarfs with spectroscopic temperatures between 19,000 and 35,000 K. We find 19 new DBVs and place upper limits on variability for the remaining 36 objects. In combination with previously known DBVs, we use these objects to provide an update to the empirical extent of the DB instability strip. With our sample of new DBVs, the red edge is better constrained, as we nearly double the number of DBVs known between 20,000 and 24,000 K. We do not find any new DBVs hotter than PG 0112+104, the current hottest DBV is at T <SUB>eff</SUB> ≈ 31,000 K, but do find pulsations in four DBVs with temperatures between 27,000 and 30,000 K, improving empirical constraints on the poorly defined blue edge. We investigate the ensemble pulsation properties of all currently known DBVs, finding that the weighted mean period and total pulsation power exhibit trends with effective temperature that are qualitatively similar to the pulsating hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..158V
Microlensing Events in the Galactic Plane Using the Zwicky Transient Facility;;Microlensing is a powerful technique to study the Galactic population of "dark" objects such as exoplanets both bound and unbound, brown dwarfs, low-luminosity stars, old white dwarfs, and neutron stars, and it is almost the only way to study isolated stellar-mass black holes. The majority of previous efforts to search for gravitational microlensing events have concentrated toward high-density fields such as the Galactic bulge. Microlensing events in the Galactic plane have the advantage of closer proximity and better constrained relative proper motions, leading to better constrained estimates of lens mass at the expense of a lower optical depth, than events toward the Galactic bulge. We use the Zwicky Transient Facility Data Release 5 compiled from 2018-2021 to survey the Galactic plane in the region of ∣b∣ < 20°. We find a total of 60 candidate microlensing events including three that show a strong microlensing parallax effect. The rate of events traces Galactic structure, decreasing exponentially as a function Galactic longitude with scale length ℓ <SUB>0</SUB> ~ 37°. On average, we find Einstein timescales of our microlensing events to be about three times as long (~60 days) as those toward the Galactic bulge (~20 days). This pilot project demonstrates that microlensing toward the Galactic plane shows strong promise for characterization of dark objects within the Galactic disk.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..150R
A Physical Model of Delayed Rebrightenings in Shock-interacting Supernovae without Narrow-line Emission;;Core-collapse supernovae can display evidence of interaction with preexisting, circumstellar shells of material by rebrightening and forming spectral lines, and can even change types as hydrogen appears in previously hydrogen-poor spectra. However, a recently observed core-collapse supernova-SN 2019tsf-was found to brighten after roughly 100 days after it was first observed, suggesting that the supernova ejecta was interacting with surrounding material, but it lacked any observable emission lines and thereby challenged the standard supernova-interaction picture. We show through linear perturbation theory that delayed rebrightenings without the formation of spectral lines are generated as a consequence of the finite sound-crossing time of the postshock gas left in the wake of a supernova explosion. In particular, we demonstrate that sound waves-generated in the postshock flow as a consequence of the interaction between a shock and a density enhancement-traverse the shocked ejecta and impinge upon the shock from behind in a finite time, generating sudden changes in the shock properties in the absence of ambient density enhancements. We also show that a blast wave dominated by gas pressure and propagating in a wind-fed medium is unstable from the standpoint that small perturbations lead to the formation of reverse shocks within the postshock flow, implying that the gas within the inner regions of these blast waves should be highly turbulent.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..148C
Identification of an X-Ray Pulsar in the BeXRB System IGR J18219-1347;;We report on observations of the candidate Be/X-ray binary (BeXRB) IGR J18219-1347 with the Swift/X-ray Telescope, the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray, and the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer during Type-I outbursts in 2020 March and June. Our timing analysis revealed the spin period of a neutron star with P <SUB>spin</SUB> = 52.46 s. This periodicity, combined with the known orbital period of 72.4 days, indicates that the system is a BeXRB. Furthermore, by comparing the spectral energy distribution of the infrared counterpart to that of known BeXRBs, we confirm this classification and set a distance of approximately 10-15 kpc for the source. The broadband X-ray spectrum (1.5-50 keV) of the source is described by an absorbed power law with a photon index Γ ~ 0.5 and a cutoff energy at ~13 keV.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..139O
Recurrent Strong Outbursts of an EXor-like Young Eruptive Star Gaia20eae;;We present follow-up photometric and spectroscopic observations, and subsequent analysis of Gaia20eae. This source triggered photometric alerts during 2020 after showing a ~3 mag increase in its brightness. Its Gaia Alert light curve showed the shape of a typical eruptive young star. We carried out observations to confirm Gaia20eae as an eruptive young star and classify it. Its pre-outburst spectral energy distribution shows that Gaia20eae is a moderately embedded Class II object with L <SUB>bol</SUB> = 7.22 L <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The color-color and color-magnitude diagrams indicate that the evolution in the light curve is mostly gray. Multiple epochs of the Hα line profile suggest an evolution of the accretion rate and winds. The near-infrared spectra display several emission lines, a feature typical of EX Lupi-type (EXor) eruptive young stars. We estimated the mass accretion rate during the dimming phase to be $\dot{M}$ = 3-8 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, higher than typical T Tauri stars of similar mass and comparable to other EXors. We conclude Gaia20eae is a new EXor-type candidate.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..125C
A Carbon/Oxygen-dominated Atmosphere Days after Explosion for the "Super-Chandrasekhar" Type Ia SN 2020esm;;Seeing pristine material from the donor star in a type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosion can reveal the nature of the binary system. In this paper, we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2020esm, one of the best-studied SNe of the class of "super-Chandrasekhar" SNe Ia (SC SNe Ia), with data obtained -12 to +360 days relative to peak brightness, obtained from a variety of ground- and space-based telescopes. Initially misclassified as a type II supernova, SN 2020esm peaked at M <SUB> B </SUB> = -19.9 mag, declined slowly (Δm <SUB>15</SUB>(B) = 0.92 mag), and had particularly blue UV and optical colors at early times. Photometrically and spectroscopically, SN 2020esm evolved similarly to other SC SNe Ia, showing the usual low ejecta velocities, weak intermediate-mass elements, and the enhanced fading at late times, but its early spectra are unique. Our first few spectra (corresponding to a phase of ≳10 days before peak) reveal a nearly pure carbon/oxygen atmosphere during the first days after explosion. This composition can only be produced by pristine material, relatively unaffected by nuclear burning. The lack of H and He may further indicate that SN 2020esm is the outcome of the merger of two carbon/oxygen white dwarfs. Modeling its bolometric light curve, we find an <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass of ${1.23}_{-0.14}^{+0.14}$ M <SUB>⊙</SUB> and an ejecta mass of ${1.75}_{-0.20}^{+0.32}$ M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, in excess of the Chandrasekhar mass. Finally, we discuss possible progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms of SN 2020esm and, in general, the SC SNe Ia class.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927...78D
A Systematic Exploration of Kilonova Candidates from Neutron Star Mergers during the Third Gravitational-wave Observing Run;;We present a comprehensive analysis of 653 optical candidate counterparts reported during the third gravitational-wave (GW) observing run. Our sample concentrates on candidates from the 15 events (published in GWTC-2, GWTC-3, or not retracted on GraceDB) that had a >1% chance of including a neutron star in order to assess their viability as true kilonovae. In particular, we leverage tools available in real time, including pre-merger detections and cross-matching with catalogs (i.e., point-source, variable-star, quasar and host-galaxy redshift data sets), to eliminate 65% of candidates in our sample. We further employ spectroscopic classifications, late-time detections, and light-curve behavior analyses and conclude that 66 candidates remain viable kilonovae. These candidates lack sufficient information to determine their classifications, and the majority would require luminosities greater than that of AT 2017gfo. Pre-merger detections in public photometric survey data and comparison of cataloged host-galaxy redshifts with the GW event distances are critical to incorporate into vetting procedures, as these tools eliminated >20% and >30% of candidates, respectively. We expect that such tools that leverage archival information will significantly reduce the strain on spectroscopic and photometric follow-up resources in future observing runs. Finally, we discuss the critical role prompt updates from GW astronomers to the EM community play in reducing the number of candidates requiring vetting.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927...50R
Gaia GraL: Gaia DR2 Gravitational Lens Systems. VII. XMM-Newton Observations of Lensed Quasars;;We present XMM-Newton X-ray observations of nine confirmed lensed quasars at 1 ≲ z ≲ 3 identified by the Gaia Gravitational Lens program. Eight systems are strongly detected, with 0.3-8.0 keV fluxes F <SUB>0.3-8.0</SUB> ≳ 5 ×10<SUP>-14</SUP> erg cm<SUP>-2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Modeling the X-ray spectra with an absorbed power law, we derive power-law photon indices and 2-10 keV luminosities for the eight detected quasars. In addition to presenting sample properties for larger quasar population studies and for use in planning for future caustic-crossing events, we also identify three quasars of interest: a quasar that shows evidence of flux variability from previous ROSAT observations, the most closely separated individual lensed sources resolved by XMM-Newton, and one of the X-ray brightest quasars known at z > 3. These sources represent the tip of the discoveries that will be enabled by SRG/eROSITA.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927...45C
Properties of Type Ibn Supernovae: Implications for the Progenitor Evolution and the Origin of a Population of Rapid Transients;;Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn) show signatures of strong interaction between the SN ejecta and hydrogen-poor circumstellar matter (CSM). Deriving the ejecta and CSM properties of SNe Ibn provides a great opportunity to study the final evolution of massive stars. In the present work, we present a light-curve (LC) model for the ejecta-CSM interaction, taking into account the processes in which the high-energy photons originally created at the forward and reverse shocks are converted to the observed emission in the optical. The model is applied to a sample of SNe Ibn and "SN Ibn" rapidly evolving transients. We show that the characteristic post-peak behavior commonly seen in the SN Ibn LCs, where a slow decay is followed by a rapid decay, is naturally explained by the transition of the forward-shock property from cooling to adiabatic regime without introducing a change in the CSM density distribution. The (commonly found) slope in the rapid-decay phase indicates a steep CSM density gradient (ρ <SUB>CSM</SUB> ∝ r <SUP>-3</SUP>), inferring a rapid increase in the mass-loss rate toward the SN as a generic property of the SN Ibn progenitors. From the derived ejecta and CSM properties, we argue that massive Wolf-Rayet stars with an initial mass of ≳18 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> can be a potential class of the progenitors. The present work also indicates the existence of a currently missing population of UV-bright rapid transients for which the final mass-loss rate is lower than the optical SNe Ibn, which can be efficiently probed by future UV missions.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927...25M
Long-term Photometric and Low-resolution Spectroscopic Analysis of Five Contact Binaries;;A photometric and spectroscopic investigation is performed on five W Ursae Majoris eclipsing binaries J015818.6+260247 (hereinafter as J0158b), J073248.4+405538 (hereinafter as J0732), J101330.8+494846 (hereinafter as J1013), J132439.8+130747 (hereinafter as J1324), and J152450.7+245943 (hereinafter as J1524). The photometric data are collected with the help of the 1.3 m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope, the 1.04 m Sampurnanand Telescope, and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite space mission. The low-resolution spectra of the 4 m Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope are used for spectroscopic analysis. The orbital period change of these systems is determined using our photometric data and previously available photometric data from different surveys. The orbital period of J1013 and J1524 is changing at a rate of -2.552 (±0.249) × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> days yr<SUP>-1</SUP> and -6.792( ±0.952) × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> days yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively, while others do not show any orbital period change. The orbital period change of J1013 and J1524 corresponds to a mass transfer rate of 2.199 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> and 6.151 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> from the primary to the secondary component in these systems. It is likely that angular momentum loss via magnetic braking may also be responsible for the observed orbital period change in the case of J1524. All systems have a mass ratio lower than 0.5, except J0158b with a mass ratio of 0.71. All the systems are shallow-type contact binaries. J0158b and J1524 are subtype A while others are subtype W. The H<SUB> α </SUB> emission line region is compared with template spectra prepared using two inactive stars with the help of the STARMOD program. The J0158, J1324, and J1524 systems show excess emission in the residual spectra after subtraction of the template.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927...12P
Less Than 1% of Core-collapse Supernovae in the Local Universe Occur in Elliptical Galaxies;;We present observations of three core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) in elliptical hosts, detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey (BTS). SN 2019ape is a SN Ic that exploded in the main body of a typical elliptical galaxy. Its properties are consistent with an explosion of a regular SN Ic progenitor. A secondary g-band light-curve peak could indicate interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar material (CSM). An Hα-emitting source at the explosion site suggests a residual local star formation origin. SN 2018fsh and SN 2020uik are SNe II which exploded in the outskirts of elliptical galaxies. SN 2020uik shows typical spectra for SNe II, while SN 2018fsh shows a boxy nebular Hα profile, a signature of CSM interaction. We combine these 3 SNe with 7 events from the literature and analyze their hosts as a sample. We present multi-wavelength photometry of the hosts, and compare this to archival photometry of all BTS hosts. Using the spectroscopically complete BTS, we conclude that $0.3{ \% }_{-0.1}^{+0.3}$ of all CCSNe occur in elliptical galaxies. We derive star formation rates and stellar masses for the host galaxies and compare them to the properties of other SN hosts. We show that CCSNe in ellipticals have larger physical separations from their hosts compared to SNe Ia in elliptical galaxies, and discuss implications for star-forming activity in elliptical galaxies.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927...10I
LkHα 225 (V1318 Cyg) South in Outburst;;Magakian et al. called attention to the current bright state of LkHα 225 South, a well-known highly embedded, intermediate-mass young stellar object that over the past two decades has brightened visually from >20<SUP> m </SUP> to <13<SUP> m </SUP>. We present recent optical photometric monitoring showing colorless, nonsinusoidal, periodic brightness oscillations occurring every 43 days with amplitude ~0.7 mag. We also present new flux-calibrated optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, which we model in terms of a Keplerian accretion disk, and high-dispersion spectra that demonstrate similarity to some categories of "mixed-temperature" accretion-outburst objects. At blue wavelengths, LkHα 225 South has a pure absorption spectrum and is a good spectral match to the FU Ori stars V1515 Cyg and V1057 Cyg. At red optical and infrared wavelengths, however, the spectrum is more similar to Gaia 19ajj, showing emission in TiO, CO, and metals. Sr II absorption indicates a low-surface-gravity atmosphere. There are also signatures of a strong wind/outflow. LkHα 225 South was moderately bright in the early 1950s as well as in the late 1980s, with evidence for deep fades during intervening epochs. The body of evidence suggests that LkHα 225 South is another case of a source with episodically enhanced accretion that causes brightening by orders of magnitude, and development of a hot absorption spectrum and warm wind. It is similar to Gaia 19ajj, but also reminiscent in its long brightening time and brightness oscillation near peak to the embedded sources L1634 IRS7 and ESO Ha 99.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..115H
SUPPNet: Neural network for stellar spectrum normalisation;;Context. Precise continuum normalisation of merged échelle spectra is a demanding task that is necessary for various detailed spectroscopic analyses. Automatic methods have limited effectiveness due to the variety of features present in the spectra of stars. This complexity often leads to the necessity for manual normalisation which is highly time-consuming. 
 Aims: The aim of this work is to develop a fully automated normalisation tool that works with order-merged spectra and offers flexible manual fine-tuning, if necessary. 
 Methods: The core of the proposed method uses the novel, fully convolutional deep neural network (SUPP Network) that was trained to predict a pseudo-continuum. The post-processing step uses smoothing splines that give access to regressed knots, which are useful for optional manual corrections. The active learning technique was applied to deal with possible biases that may arise from training with synthetic spectra and to extend the applicability of the proposed method to features absent in this kind of spectra. 
 Results: The developed normalisation method was tested with high-resolution spectra of stars with spectral types from O to G, and gives a root mean squared (RMS) error over the set of test stars equal to 0.0128 in the spectral range from 3900 Å to 7000 Å and 0.0081 in the range from 4200 Å to 7000 Å. Experiments with synthetic spectra give a RMS of the order of 0.0050. 
 Conclusions: The proposed method leads to results that are comparable to careful manual normalisation. Additionally, this approach is general and can be used in other fields of astronomy where background modelling or trend removal is a part of data processing.

On the trail of a comet's tail: A particle tracking algorithm for comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko;;Context. During the post-perihelion phase of the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission to comet <ASTROBJ>67P</ASTROBJ>, the Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System on board the spacecraft took numerous image sequences of the near-nucleus coma, with many showing the motion of individual pieces of debris ejected from active surface areas into space. 
 Aims: We aim to track the motion of individual particles in these image sequences and derive their projected velocities and accelerations. This should help us to constrain their point of origin on the surface, understand the forces that influence their dynamics in the inner coma, and predict whether they will fall back to the surface or escape to interplanetary space. 
 Methods: We have developed an algorithm that tracks the motion of particles appearing as point sources in image sequences. Our algorithm employs a point source detection software to locate the particles and then exploits the image sequences' pair-nature to reconstruct the particle tracks and derive the projected velocities and accelerations. We also constrained the particle size from their brightness. 
 Results: Our algorithm identified 2268 tracks in a sample image sequence. Manual inspection not only found that 1187 (∼52%) of them are likely genuine, but in combination with runs on simulated data it also revealed a simple criterion related to the completeness of a track to single out a large subset of the genuine tracks without the need for manual intervention. A tentative analysis of a small (n = 89) group of particles exemplifies how our data can be used, and provides first results on the particles' velocity, acceleration, and radius distributions, which agree with previous work.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...659A.171P
A WISE view on extreme AGB stars;;Context. Variability is a key property of stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). Their pulsation period is related to the luminosity and mass-loss rate (MLR) of the star. Long-period variables (LPVs) and Mira variables are the most prominent of all types of variability of evolved stars. However, the reddest, most obscured AGB stars are too faint in the optical and have eluded large variability surveys. 
 Aims: Our goal is to obtain a sample of LPVs with large MLRs by analysing WISE W1 and W2 light curves (LCs) for about 2000 sources, photometrically selected to include known C-stars with the 11.3 μm silicon carbide dust feature in absorption, and Galactic O-stars with periods longer than 1000 days. 
 Methods: Epoch photometry was retrieved from the AllWISE and NEOWISE database and fitted with a sinus curve. Photometry from other variability surveys was also downloaded and fitted. For a subset of 316 of the reddest stars, spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were constructed, and, together with mid-infrared (MIR) spectra when available, fitted with a dust radiative transfer programme in order to derive MLRs. 
 Results: WISE based LCs and fits to the data are presented for all stars. Periods from the literature and periods from refitting other literature data are presented. The results of the spatial correlation with several (IR) databases is presented. About one-third of the sources are found to be not real, but it appears that these cannot be easily filtered out by using WISE flags. Some are clones of extremely bright sources, and in some cases the LCs show the known pulsation period. Inspired by a recent paper, a number of non-variable OH/IRs are identified. Based on a selection on amplitude, a sample of about 750 (candidate) LPVs is selected of which 145 have periods > 1000 days, many of them being new. For the subset of the stars with the colours of C-rich extremely red objects (EROs) the fitting of the SEDs (and available MIR spectra) separates them into C- and O-rich objects. Interestingly, the fitting of MIR spectra of mass-losing C-stars is shown to be a powerful tracer of interstellar reddening when A<SUB>V</SUB> ≳ 2 mag. The number of Galactic EROs appears to be complete up to about 5 kpc and a total dust return rate in the solar neighbourhood for this class is determined. In the LMC 12 additional EROs are identified. Although this represents only about 0.15% of the total known LMC C-star population adding their MLRs increases the previously estimated dust return by 8%. Based on the EROs in the Magellanic Clouds, a bolometric period luminosity is derived. It is pointed out that due to their faintness, EROs and similar O-rich objects are ideal targets for a NIR version of Gaia to obtain distances, observing in the K-band or, even more efficiently, in the L-band.

The first study of four doubly eclipsing systems;;We present the discovery and the very first analysis of four stellar systems showing two periods of eclipses, that are the objects classified as doubly eclipsing systems. Some of them were proved to orbit each other thanks to their eclipse-timing-variations (ETVs) of both pairs, hence they really constitute rare quadruples with two eclipsing pairs. Some of them do not, as we are still waiting for more data to detect their mutual movement. Their light curves and period changes were analysed. All of them are detached and near-contact, but none of them contact; moreover, to our knowledge none of these stars can be considered as blend of two spatially unresolved close components on the sky. These systems are CzeV2647 (0.5723296 + 0.9637074 days), proved to orbit with 4.5-year periodicity; CzeV1645 (1.0944877 + 1.6594641 days), with a rather questionable detection of ETV; CzeV3436 (0.6836870 + 0.3833930 days); and, finally, OGLE SMC-ECL-1758 (0.9291925 + 3.7350826 days), proved to move on its 30-year orbit. Even more surprising is the fact that most of these systems show the ratio of their two orbital periods close to coupling near some resonant values of small integers, namely CzeV2647, with only 1% from 3:5 resonance, CzeV1645 1% from 2:3 resonance, and OGLE SMC-ECL-1758 with only 0.49% from 1:4 resonance. The nature of these near-resonant states still remains a mystery.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...659A...8Z
Identifications of RR Lyrae Stars and Quasars from the Simulated Data of Mephisto-W Survey;;We have investigated the feasibilities and accuracies of the identifications of RR Lyrae stars and quasars from the simulated data of the Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) W Survey. Based on the variable sources light curve libraries from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 data and the observation history simulation from the Mephisto-W Survey Scheduler, we have simulated the uvgriz multi-band light curves of RR Lyrae stars, quasars and other variable sources for the first year observation of Mephisto W Survey. We have applied the ensemble machine learning algorithm Random Forest Classifier (RFC) to identify RR Lyrae stars and quasars, respectively. We build training and test samples and extract ~150 features from the simulated light curves and train two RFCs respectively for the RR Lyrae star and quasar classification. We find that, our RFCs are able to select the RR Lyrae stars and quasars with remarkably high precision and completeness, with purity = 95.4% and completeness = 96.9% for the RR Lyrae RFC and purity = 91.4% and completeness = 90.2% for the quasar RFC. We have also derived relative importances of the extracted features utilized to classify RR Lyrae stars and quasars.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022RAA....22b5004L
New Modules for the SEDMachine to Remove Contaminations from Cosmic Rays and Non-target Light: BYECR and CONTSEP;;Currently time-domain astronomy can scan the entire sky on a daily basis, discovering thousands of interesting transients every night. Classifying the ever-increasing number of new transients is one of the main challenges for the astronomical community. One solution that addresses this issue is the robotically controlled Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM) which supports the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). SEDM with its pipeline PYSEDM demonstrates that real-time robotic spectroscopic classification is feasible. In an effort to improve the quality of the current SEDM data, we present here two new modules, BYECR and CONTSEP. The first removes contamination from cosmic rays, and the second removes contamination from non-target light. These new modules are part of the automated PYSEDM pipeline and fully integrated with the whole process. Employing BYECR and CONTSEP modules together automatically extracts more spectra than the current PYSEDM pipeline. Using SNID classification results, the new modules show an improvement in the classification rate and accuracy of 2.8% and 1.7%, respectively, while the strength of the cross-correlation remains the same. Improvements to the SEDM astrometry would further boost the improvement of the CONTSEP module. This kind of robotic follow-up with a fully automated pipeline has the potential to provide the spectroscopic classifications for the transients discovered by ZTF and also by the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134b4505K
Citizen ASAS-SN Data Release. I. Variable Star Classification Using Citizen Science;;We present the first results from Citizen ASAS-SN, a citizen science project for the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) hosted on the Zooniverse platform. Citizen ASAS-SN utilizes the newer, deeper, higher cadence ASAS-SN g-band data and tasks volunteers to classify periodic variable star candidates based on their phased light curves. We started from 40,640 new variable candidates from an input list of ~7.4 million stars with δ < -60° and the volunteers identified 10,420 new discoveries which they classified as 4234 pulsating variables, 3132 rotational variables, 2923 eclipsing binaries, and 131 variables flagged as Unknown. They classified known variable stars with an accuracy of 89% for pulsating variables, 81% for eclipsing binaries, and 49% for rotational variables. We examine user performance, agreement between users, and compare the citizen science classifications with our machine learning classifier updated for the g-band light curves. In general, user activity correlates with higher classification accuracy and higher user agreement. We used the user's "Junk" classifications to develop an effective machine learning classifier to separate real from false variables, and there is a clear path for using this "Junk" training set to significantly improve our primary machine learning classifier. We also illustrate the value of Citizen ASAS-SN for identifying unusual variables with several examples.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134b4201C
TOI-2285b: A 1.7 Earth-radius planet near the habitable zone around a nearby M dwarf;;We report the discovery of TOI-2285b, a sub-Neptune-sized planet transiting a nearby (42 pc) M dwarf with a period of 27.3 d. We identified the transit signal from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite photometric data, which we confirmed with ground-based photometric observations using the multiband imagers MuSCAT2 and MuSCAT3. Combining these data with other follow-up observations including high-resolution spectroscopy with the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph, high-resolution imaging with the SPeckle Polarimeter, and radial velocity (RV) measurements with the InfraRed Doppler instrument, we find that the planet has a radius of $1.74 \pm 0.08\, R_\oplus$, a mass of $ \!\!19.5\,M_\oplus$ ($95\%$ c.l.), and an insolation flux of 1.54 ± 0.14 times that of the Earth. Although the planet resides just outside the habitable zone for a rocky planet, if the planet harbors an H<SUB>2</SUB>O layer under a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, then liquid water could exist on the surface of the H<SUB>2</SUB>O layer depending on the planetary mass and water mass fraction. The bright host star in the near-infrared (K<SUB>s</SUB> = 9.0) makes this planet an excellent target for further RV and atmospheric observations to improve our understanding of the composition, formation, and habitability of sub-Neptune-sized planets.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASJ...74L...1F
Multimessenger astronomy with a kHz-band gravitational-wave observatory;;Proposed next-generation networks of gravitational-wave observatories include dedicated kilohertz instruments that target neutron star science, such as the proposed Neutron Star Extreme Matter Observatory, NEMO. The original proposal for NEMO highlighted the need for it to exist in a network of gravitational-wave observatories to ensure detection confidence and sky localisation of sources. We show that NEMO-like observatories have significant utility on their own as coincident electromagnetic observations can provide the detection significance and sky localisation. We show that, with a single NEMO-like detector and expected electromagnetic observatories in the late 2020 s and early 2030 s such as the Vera C. Rubin observatory and SVOM, approximately 40% of all binary neutron star mergers detected with gravitational waves could be confidently identified as coincident multimessenger detections. We show that we expect $2^{+10}_{-1}{yr^{-1}}{}$ coincident observations of gravitational-wave mergers with gamma-ray burst prompt emission, $13^{+23}_{-10}{yr^{-1}}{}$ detections with kilonova observations, and $4^{+18}_{-3}{yr^{-1}}{}$ with broadband afterglows and kilonovae, where the uncertainties are 90% confidence intervals arising from uncertainty in current merger-rate estimates. Combined, this implies a coincident detection rate of $14^{+25}_{-11}{yr^{-1}}{}$ out to $300 Mpc$ . These numbers indicate significant science potential for a single kilohertz gravitational-wave detector operating without a global network of other gravitational-wave observatories.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASA...39....7S
Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey: Data Release 1 blended spectra search for candidate strong gravitational lenses;;Here, we present a catalogue of blended spectra in Data Release 1 of the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. Of the 23 197 spectra, 181 showed signs of a blend of redshifts and spectral templates. We examine these blends in detail for signs of either a candidate strong lensing galaxy or a useful overlapping galaxy pair. One of the three DEVILS target fields, COSMOS (D10), is close to complete and it is fully imaged with Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys, and we visually examine the 57 blended spectra in this field in the F814W postage stamps. Nine are classical strong lensing candidates with an elliptical as the lens, out to higher redshifts than any previous search with spectroscopic surveys such as Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) or Galaxy And Mass Assembly. The gravitational lens candidate success rate is similar to earlier such searches (0.1 per cent). Strong gravitational lenses identified with blended spectroscopy have typically shown a high success rate (>70 per cent), which make these interesting targets for future higher resolution lensing studies, monitoring for supernova cosmography, or searches for magnified atomic hydrogen signal.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.2305H
The Zwicky Transient Facility Type Ia supernova survey: first data release and results;;Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the nearby Hubble flow are excellent distance indicators in cosmology. The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) has observed a large sample of SNe from an untargeted, rolling survey, reaching 20.8, 20.6, and 20.3 mag in g r, and i band, respectively. With an FoV of 47 deg<SUP>2</SUP>, ZTF discovered > 3000 SNe Ia in a little over 2.5 yr. Here, we report on the sample of 761 spectroscopically classified SNe Ia from the first year of operations (DR1). The sample has a median redshift $\bar{z} =$ 0.057, nearly a factor of 2 higher than the current low-z sample. Our sample has a total of 934 spectra, of which 632 were obtained with the robotic SEDm on Palomar P60. We assess the potential for precision cosmology for a total of 305 SNe with redshifts from host galaxy spectra. The sample is already comparable in size to the entire combined literature low-z anchor sample. The median first detection is 13.5 d before maximum light, about 10 d earlier than the median in the literature. Furthermore, six SNe from our sample are at D<SUB>L</SUB> < 80 Mpc, for which host galaxy distances can be obtained in the JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE era, such that we have calibrator and Hubble flow SNe observed with the same instrument. In the entire duration of ZTF-I, we have observed nearly 50 SNe for which we can obtain calibrator distances, key for per cent level distance scale measurements.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.2228D
Observable gravitational waves from tidal disruption events and their electromagnetic counterpart;;We estimate the rate of tidal disruption events (TDEs) that will be detectable with future gravitational wave detectors as well as the most probable properties of these events and their possible electromagnetic counterpart. To this purpose, we combine standard gravitational waves and electromagnetic results with detailed rates estimates. We find that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should not detect any TDEs, unless black holes (BHs) are typically embedded by a young stellar population, which, in this situation, could lead up to few 10 events during the duration of the mission. If there are gravitational wave observations, these events should also be observable in the X-ray or the optical/UV part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which may open up the multimessenger era for TDEs. The generation of detectors following LISA will at least yearly observe 10<SUP>4</SUP> TDEs at cosmological distances, allowing to do population studies and constrain the black hole mass function. In all cases, most probable events should be around black holes with a mass such that the Keplerian frequency at the Schwarzschild radius is similar to the optimal frequency of the detector and with a large penetration factor.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.2025P
Optical flux and colour variability of blazars in the ZTF survey;;We investigate the temporal and colour variability of 897 blazars, comprising 455 BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) and 442 Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), selected from the Roma-BZCAT catalogue, using the multiband light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF DR6) survey. Assessing the colour variability characteristics over ~2 yr time-scales, we found that 18.5 per cent (84 out of 455) BL Lacs showed a stronger bluer-when-brighter (BWB) trend, whereas 9.0 per cent (41 out of 455) showed a redder-when-brighter (RWB) trend. The majority (70 per cent) of the BL Lacs showing RWB are host galaxy dominated. For the FSRQ subclass, 10.2 per cent (45 out of 442) objects showed a strong BWB trend and 17.6 per cent (78 out of 442) showed a strong RWB trend. Hence, we find that BL Lacs more commonly follow a BWB trend than do FSRQs. This can be attributed to the more dominant jet emission in the case of BL Lacs and the contribution of thermal emission from the accretion disc for FSRQs. In analysing the colour behaviour on shorter time windows, we find many blazars evince shorter partial trends of BWB or RWB nature (or occasionally both). Some of such complex colour behaviours observed in the colour-magnitude diagrams of the blazars may result from transitions between the jet-dominated state and the disc-dominated state and vice versa.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.1791N
The return of the spin period in DW Cnc and evidence of new high state outbursts;;DW Cnc is an intermediate polar which has previously been observed in both high and low states. Observations of the high state of DW Cnc have previously revealed a spin period at ~38.6 min, however, observations from the 2018 to 2019 low state showed no evidence of the spin period. We present results from our analysis of 12 s cadence photometric data collected by Next Generation Transit Survey of DW Cnc during the high state which began in 2019. Following the previously reported suppression of the spin period signal, we identify the return of this signal during the high state, consistent with previous observations of it. We identify this as the restarting of accretion during the high state. We further identified three short outbursts lasting ~1 d in DW Cnc with a mean recurrence time of ~60 d and an amplitude of ~1 mag. These are the first outbursts identified in DW Cnc since 2008. Due to the short nature of these events, we identify them not as a result of accretion instabilities but instead either from instabilities originating from the interaction of the magnetorotational instability in the accretion disc and the magnetic field generated by the white dwarf or the result of magnetic gating.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.1002D
The large-scale environment of thermonuclear and core-collapse supernovae;;The new generation of wide-field time-domain surveys has made it feasible to study the clustering of supernova (SN) host galaxies in the large-scale structure (LSS) for the first time. We investigate the LSS environment of SN populations, using 106 dark matter density realisations with a resolution of ~3.8 Mpc, constrained by the 2M+ + galaxy survey. We limit our analysis to redshift z < 0.036, using samples of 498 thermonuclear and 782 core-collapse SNe from the Zwicky Transient Facility's Bright Transient Survey and Census of the Local Universe catalogues. We detect clustering of SNe with high significance; the observed clustering of the two SNe populations is consistent with each other. Further, the clustering of SN hosts is consistent with that of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey DR12 spectroscopic galaxy sample in the same redshift range. Using a tidal shear classifier, we classify the LSS into voids, sheets, filaments, and knots. We find that both SNe and SDSS galaxies are predominantly found in sheets and filaments. SNe are significantly under-represented in voids and over-represented in knots compared to the volume fraction in these structures. This work opens the potential for using forthcoming wide-field deep SN surveys as a complementary LSS probe.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510..366T
An imaging polarimetry survey of Type Ia supernovae: are peculiar extinction and polarization properties produced by circumstellar or interstellar matter?;;Some highly reddened Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) display low total-to-selective extinction ratios (R<SUB>V</SUB> ≲ 2) in comparison to that of typical Milky Way dust (R<SUB>V</SUB> ≈ 3.3), and polarization curves that rise steeply to blue wavelengths, with peak polarization values at short wavelengths ($\lambda _{\rm max}  0.4\, \mu$m) in comparison to the typical Galactic values ($\lambda _{\rm max} \approx 0.55\, \mu$ m). Understanding the source of these properties could provide insight into the progenitor systems of SNe Ia. We aim to determine whether they are the result of the host galaxy's interstellar dust or circumstellar dust. This is accomplished by analysing the continuum polarization of 66 SNe Ia in dust-rich spiral galaxies and 13 SNe Ia in dust-poor elliptical galaxies as a function of normalized galactocentric distance. We find that there is a general trend of SNe Ia in spiral galaxies displaying increased polarization values when located closer to the host galaxies' centre, while SNe Ia in elliptical host galaxies display low polarization. Furthermore, all highly polarized SNe Ia in spiral host galaxies display polarization curves rising toward blue wavelengths, while no evidence of such polarization properties is shown in elliptical host galaxies. This indicates that the source of the peculiar polarization curves is likely the result of interstellar material as opposed to circumstellar material. The peculiar polarization and extinction properties observed toward some SNe Ia may be explained by the radiative torque disruption mechanism induced by the SN or the interstellar radiation field.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.6028C
Two c's in a pod: cosmology-independent measurement of the Type Ia supernova colour-luminosity relation with a sibling pair;;Using Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations, we identify a pair of 'sibling' Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), i.e. hosted by the same galaxy at z = 0.0541. They exploded within 200 d from each other at a separation of $0.6\,\mathrm{ arcsec}$ corresponding to a projected distance of only 0.6 kpc. Performing SALT2 light-curve fits to the gri ZTF photometry, we show that for these equally distant 'standardizable candles', there is a difference of 2 mag in their rest-frame B-band peaks, and the fainter supernova (SN) has a significantly red SALT2 colour c = 0.57 ± 0.04, while the stretch values x<SUB>1</SUB> of the two SNe are similar, suggesting that the fainter SN is attenuated by dust in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy. We use these measurements to infer the SALT2 colour standardization parameter, β = 3.5 ± 0.3, independent of the underlying cosmology and Malmquist bias. Assuming the colour excess is entirely due to dust, the result differs by 2σ from the average Milky Way total-to-selective extinction ratio, but is in good agreement with the colour-brightness corrections empirically derived from the most recent SN Ia Hubble-Lemaitre diagram fits. Thus we suggest that SN 'siblings', which will increasingly be discovered in the coming years, can be used to probe the validity of the colour and light-curve shape corrections using in SN Ia cosmology while avoiding important systematic effects in their inference from global multiparameter fits to inhomogeneous data sets, and also help constrain the role of interstellar dust in SN Ia cosmology.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.5340B
The ZTF-BTS Type Ia supernovae luminosity function is consistent with a single progenitor channel for the explosions;;We construct the Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) luminosity function (LF) using the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey (BTS) catalogue. While this magnitude-limited survey has an unprecedented number of objects, it suffers from large distance uncertainties and lacks an estimation of host extinction. We bypass these issues by calculating the intrinsic luminosities from the shape parameters of the light curve's g and r bands, with the luminosities calibrated from the well observed SNe Ia sample of the Carnegie Supernova Project, allowing us to construct, for the first time, the intrinsic LF of SNe Ia. We then use a novel tight relation between the colour stretch and the synthesized <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass, M<SUB>Ni56</SUB>, to determine the M<SUB>Ni56</SUB> distribution of SNe Ia. We find that the LFs are unimodal, with their peaks in line with previous results, but have a much lower rate of dim events and luminous events. We show that the features on top of the unimodal LF-derived distributions are all compatible with statistical noise, consistent with a single progenitor channel for the explosions. We further derive, for the first time, the SNe Ia distribution of host galaxy extinction, and find a mean selective extinction of E(B - V) ≈ 0.1 and a non-negligible fraction with large, $ 1\, \text{mag}$, extinction in the optical bands. The high extinction is typical for luminous SNe, supporting their young population origin.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.5275S
DBSP_DRP: A Python package for automated spectroscopic data reduction of DBSP data;;DBSP_DRP is a python package that provides fully automated data reduction of data taken by the Double Spectrograph (DBSP) at the 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory (Oke & Gunn, 1982). The underlying data reduction functionality to extract 1D spectra, perform flux calibration and correction for atmospheric absorption, and coadd spectra together is provided by PypeIt (Prochaska et al., 2020). The new functionality that DBSP_DRP brings is in orchestrating the complex data reduction process by making smart decisions so that no user input is required after verifying the correctness of the metadata in the raw FITS files in a table-like GUI. Though the primary function of DBSP_DRP is to automatically reduce an entire night of data without user input, it has the flexibility for astronomers to fine-tune the data reduction with GUIs for manually identifying the faintest objects, as well as exposing the full set of PypeIt parameters to be tweaked for users with particular science needs. DBSP_DRP also handles some of the occasional quirks specific to DBSP, such as swapping FITS header cards, adding (an) extra null byte/s to FITS files making them not conform to the FITS specification, and not writing the coordinates of the observation to file. Additionally, DBSP_DRP contains a quicklook script for making real-time decisions during an observing run, and can open a GUI displaying a minimally reduced exposure in under 15 seconds. Docker containers are available for ease of deploying DBSP_DRP in its quicklook configuration (without some large atmospheric model files) or in its full configuration.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JOSS....7.3612M
Astronomical big data processing using machine learning: A comprehensive review;;Astronomy, being one of the oldest observational sciences, has collected a lot of data over the ages. In recent times, it is experiencing a huge data surge due to advancements in telescopic technologies with automated digital outputs. The main driver behind this article is to present various relevant Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and big data frameworks or tools being applied and can be employed in large astronomical data-set analysis to assist astronomers in solving multiple vital intriguing problems. Throughout this survey, we attempt to review, evaluate and summarize diverse astronomical data sources, gain knowledge of structure, the complexity of the data, and challenges in the data processing. Additionally, we discuss ample technologies being developed to handle and process this voluminous data. We also look at numerous activities being carried out all over the world enriching this domain. While going through existing literature, we perceived a limited number of comprehensive studies reported so far analyzing astronomy data-sets from the viewpoint of parallel processing and machine learning collectively. This motivated us to pursue this extensive literature review task by outlining up-to-date contributions and opportunities available in this area. Besides, this article also discusses briefly a cloud-based machine learning approach to estimate the extra-galactic object redshifts considering photometric data as input features. As the intersection of big data, machine learning and astronomy is a quite new paradigm, this article will create a strong awareness among interested young scientists for future research and provide an appropriate insight on how these algorithms and tools are becoming inevitable to the astronomy community day by day.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ExA....53....1S
A Fresh Look at AGB Stars in Galactic Open Clusters with Gaia: Impact on Stellar Models and the Initial-Final Mass Relation;;Benefiting from the Gaia second and early third releases of photometric and astrometric data, we examine the population of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars that appear in the fields of intermediate-age and young open star clusters. We identify 49 AGB star candidates, brighter than the tip of the red giant branch, with a good to high cluster membership probability. Among them, we find 19 TP-AGB stars with known spectral type: 4 M stars, 3 MS/S stars, and 12 C stars. By combining observations, stellar models, and radiative transfer calculations that include the effect of circumstellar dust, we characterize each star in terms of initial mass, luminosity, mass-loss rate, core mass, period, and mode of pulsation. The information collected helps us shed light on the TP-AGB evolution at solar-like metallicity, placing constraints on the third dredge-up process, the initial masses of carbon stars, stellar winds, and the initial-final mass relation (IFMR). In particular, we find that two bright carbon stars, MSB 75 and BM IV 90, members of the clusters NGC 7789 and NGC 2660 (with similar ages of ≃ 1.2-1.6 Gyr and initial masses 2.1 ≳ M <SUB>i</SUB> /M <SUB>⊙</SUB> ≳ 1.9), have unusually high core masses, M <SUB>c</SUB> ≈ 0.67-0.7 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. These results support the findings of a recent work (Marigo et al. 2020) that identified a kink in the IFMR, which interrupts its monotonic trend just at the same initial masses. Finally, we investigate two competing scenarios to explain the M <SUB>c</SUB> data: the role of stellar winds in single-star evolution, and binary interactions through the blue straggler channel.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJS..258...43M
The Unanticipated Phenomenology of the Blazar PKS 2131-021: A Unique Supermassive Black Hole Binary Candidate;;Most large galaxies host supermassive black holes in their nuclei and are subject to mergers, which can produce a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB), and hence periodic signatures due to orbital motion. We report unique periodic radio flux density variations in the blazar PKS 2131-021, which strongly suggest an SMBHB with an orbital separation of ~0.001-0.01 pc. Our 45.1 yr radio light curve shows two epochs of strong sinusoidal variation with the same period and phase to within ≲2% and ~10%, respectively, straddling a 20 yr period when this variation was absent. Our simulated light curves accurately reproduce the "red noise" of this object, and Lomb-Scargle, weighted wavelet Z-transform and least-squares sine-wave analyses demonstrate conclusively, at the 4.6σ significance level, that the periodicity in this object is not due to random fluctuations in flux density. The observed period translates to 2.082 ± 0.003 yr in the rest frame at the z = 1.285 redshift of PKS 2131-021. The periodic variation in PKS 2131-021 is remarkably sinusoidal. We present a model in which orbital motion, combined with the strong Doppler boosting of the approaching relativistic jet, produces a sine-wave modulation in the flux density that easily fits the observations. Given the rapidly developing field of gravitational-wave experiments with pulsar timing arrays, closer counterparts to PKS 2131-021 and searches using the techniques we have developed are strongly motivated. These results constitute a compelling demonstration that the phenomenology, not the theory, must provide the lead in this field.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926L..35O
Optical Rebrightening of Extragalactic Transients from the Zwicky Transient Facility;;Ongoing large-scale optical time-domain surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), are producing alerts at unprecedented rates. Analysis of transient sources has so far followed two distinct paths: archival analysis of data on transient sources at a time when they are no longer observable and real-time analysis at the time when the sources are first detected. The latter is the realm of alert brokers such as the Arizona-NOIRLab Temporal Analysis and Response to Events System (ANTARES). In this paper, we synthesize the two analysis paths and present a first systematic study of archival alert-broker data, focusing on extragalactic transients with multipeaked light curves identified in the ANTARES archive of ZTF alerts. Our analysis yields a sample of 37 such sources, including core-collapse supernovae (with two analogs of iPTF14hls), thermonuclear supernovae interacting with their surrounding circumstellar medium, tidal disruption events, luminous blue variables, and as yet unclassified objects. A large fraction of the identified sources is currently active, warranting allocation of follow-up resources in the immediate future to further constrain their nature and the physical processes at work.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926L..11S
New Clues to the Evolution of Dwarf Carbon Stars From Their Variability and X-Ray Emission;;As main-sequence stars with C > O, dwarf carbon (dC) stars are never born alone but inherit carbon-enriched material from a former asymptotic giant branch (AGB) companion. In contrast to M dwarfs in post-mass-transfer binaries, C<SUB>2</SUB> and/or CN molecular bands allow dCs to be identified with modest-resolution optical spectroscopy, even after the AGB remnant has cooled beyond detectability. Accretion of substantial material from the AGB stars should spin up the dCs, potentially causing a rejuvenation of activity detectable in X-rays. Indeed, a few dozen dCs have recently been found to have photometric variability with periods under a day. However, most of those are likely post-common-envelope binaries, spin-orbit locked by tidal forces, rather than solely spun-up by accretion. Here, we study the X-ray properties of a sample of the five nearest-known dCs with Chandra. Two are detected in X-rays, the only two for which we also detected short-period photometric variability. We suggest that the coronal activity detected so far in dCs is attributable to rapid rotation due to tidal locking in short binary orbits after a common-envelope phase, late in the thermally pulsing (TP) phase of the former C-AGB primary (TP-AGB).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926..210R
A Systematic Analysis of Stellar Populations in the Host Galaxies of Changing-look AGNs;;"Changing-look" active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs) are a newly discovered class of AGNs that show the appearance (or disappearance) of broad emission lines within short timescales (months to years), and are often associated with dramatic changes in their continuum emissions. They provide us with an unprecedented chance to directly investigate the host galaxy properties with minimal contamination from the luminous central engine during the turn-off state, which is difficult for normal luminous AGNs. In this work, for the first time, we systematically characterize the stellar populations and star formation histories of host galaxies for 26 turn-off CL-AGNs using the stellar population synthesis code STARLIGHT. We find that the stellar populations of CL-AGNs are similar to those of normal AGNs, except that the intermediate stellar populations contribute more fractions. We estimate their stellar velocity dispersions (σ <SUB>⋆</SUB>) and black hole masses (M <SUB>BH,vir</SUB>), and find that CL-AGNs also follow the overall M <SUB>BH</SUB>-σ <SUB>⋆</SUB> relationship. We also confirm the previous claims that CL-AGNs tend to be biased toward lower Eddington ratios, and that their extreme variabilities are more likely due to the intrinsic changes of the accretion rates. In addition, CL-AGNs with recent star formations tend to have higher Eddington ratios. Compared with previous studies, our analysis suggests that there may be a correlation between CL-AGN host galaxy properties and their CL phenomena.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926..184J
An Infrared Search for Kilonovae with the WINTER Telescope. I. Binary Neutron Star Mergers;;The Wide-Field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) is a new 1 deg<SUP>2</SUP> seeing-limited time-domain survey instrument designed for dedicated near-infrared follow-up of kilonovae from binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole mergers. WINTER will observe in the near-infrared Y, J, and short-H bands (0.9-1.7 μm, to J <SUB> AB </SUB> = 21 mag) on a dedicated 1 m telescope at Palomar Observatory. To date, most prompt kilonova follow-up has been in optical wavelengths; however, near-infrared emission fades more slowly and depends less on geometry and viewing angle than optical emission. We present an end-to-end simulation of a follow-up campaign during the fourth observing run (O4) of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA interferometers, including simulating 625 BNS mergers, their detection in gravitational waves, low-latency and full parameter estimation skymaps, and a suite of kilonova lightcurves from two different model grids. We predict up to five new kilonovae independently discovered by WINTER during O4, given a realistic BNS merger rate. Using a larger grid of kilonova parameters, we find that kilonova emission is ≈2 times longer lived and red kilonovae are detected ≈1.5 times further in the infrared than in the optical. For 90% localization areas smaller than 150 (450) deg<SUP>2</SUP>, WINTER will be sensitive to more than 10% of the kilonova model grid out to 350 (200) Mpc. We develop a generalized toolkit to create an optimal BNS follow-up strategy with any electromagnetic telescope and present WINTER's observing strategy with this framework. This toolkit, all simulated gravitational-wave events, and skymaps are made available for use by the community.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926..152F
Circumstellar Interaction Powers the Light Curves of Luminous Rapidly Evolving Optical Transients;;Rapidly evolving transients, or objects that rise and fade in brightness on timescales two to three times shorter than those of typical Type Ia or Type II supernovae (SNe), have uncertain progenitor systems and powering mechanisms. Recent studies have noted similarities between rapidly evolving transients and Type Ibn SNe, which are powered by ejecta interacting with He-rich circumstellar material (CSM). In this work we present multiband photometric and spectroscopic observations from Las Cumbres Observatory and Swift of four fast-evolving Type Ibn SNe. We compare these observations with those of rapidly evolving transients identified in the literature. We discuss several common characteristics between these two samples, including their light curve and color evolution as well as their spectral features. To investigate a common powering mechanism we construct a grid of analytical model light curves with luminosity inputs from CSM interaction as well as <SUP>56</SUP>Ni radioactive decay. We find that models with ejecta masses of ≈1-3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, CSM masses of ≈0.2-1 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, and CSM radii of ≈20-65 au can explain the diversity of peak luminosities, rise times, and decline rates observed in Type Ibn SNe and rapidly evolving transients. This suggests that a common progenitor system-the core collapse of a high-mass star within a dense CSM shell-can reproduce the light curves of even the most luminous and fast-evolving objects, such as AT 2018cow. This work is one of the first to reproduce the light curves of both SNe Ibn and other rapidly evolving transients with a single model.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926..125P
Radio and X-Ray Observations of the Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient AT 2020xnd;;We present deep X-ray and radio observations of the fast blue optical transient (FBOT) AT 2020xnd/ZTF 20acigmel at z = 0.2433 from 13 days to 269 days after explosion. AT 2020xnd belongs to the category of optically luminous FBOTs with similarities to the archetypal event AT 2018cow. AT 2020xnd shows luminous radio emission reaching L <SUB> ν </SUB> ≈ 8 × 10<SUP>29</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> Hz<SUP>-1</SUP> at 20 GHz and 75 days post-explosion, accompanied by luminous and rapidly fading soft X-ray emission peaking at L <SUB>X</SUB> ≈ 6 × 10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Interpreting the radio emission in the context of synchrotron radiation from the explosion's shock interaction with the environment, we find that AT 2020xnd launched a high-velocity outflow (v ~ 0.1c-0.2c) propagating into a dense circumstellar medium (effective $\dot{M}\approx {10}^{-3}\,{M}_{\odot }$ yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for an assumed wind velocity of v <SUB>w</SUB> = 1000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). Similar to AT 2018cow, the detected X-ray emission is in excess compared to the extrapolated synchrotron spectrum and constitutes a different emission component, possibly powered by accretion onto a newly formed black hole or neutron star. These properties make AT 2020xnd a high-redshift analog to AT 2018cow, and establish AT 2020xnd as the fourth member of the class of optically luminous FBOTs with luminous multiwavelength counterparts.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926..112B
Late-onset Circumstellar Medium Interactions are Rare: An Unbiased GALEX View of Type Ia Supernovae;;Using ultraviolet (UV) light curves, we constrain the circumstellar environments of 1080 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) within z < 0.5 from archival Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) observations. All SNe Ia are required to have pre- and post-explosion GALEX observations to ensure adequate subtraction of the host-galaxy flux. Using the late-time GALEX observations, we look for the UV excess expected from any interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM). Four SNe Ia are detected near maximum light, and we compare the GALEX photometry to archival data. However, we find that none of our targets show convincing evidence of CSM interaction. A recent Hubble Space Telescope (HST) survey estimates that ~6% of SNe Ia may interact with distant CSM, but statistical inferences are complicated by the small sample size and selection effects. By injecting model light curves into our data and then recovering them, we constrain a broad range of CSM interactions based on the CSM interaction start time and the maximum luminosity. Combining our GALEX nondetections with the HST results, we constrain occurrence of late-onset CSM interaction among SNe Ia with moderate CSM interaction, similar to that observed in PTF11kx, to f <SUB>CSM</SUB> ≲ 5.1% between 0 and 500 days after discovery and ≲2.7% between 500 and 1000 days after discovery at 90% confidence. For weaker CSM interactions similar to SN 2015cp, we obtain limits of ≲16% and ≲4.8%, respectively, for the same time ranges.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926...98D
Gaia 20eae: A Newly Discovered Episodically Accreting Young Star;;The Gaia Alert System issued an alert on 2020 August 28, on Gaia 20eae when its light curve showed a ~4.25 magnitude outburst. We present multiwavelength photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations of this source since 2020 August and identify it as the newest member of the FUor/EXor family of sources. We find that the present brightening of Gaia 20eae is not due to the dust-clearing event but due to an intrinsic change in the spectral energy distribution. The light curve of Gaia 20eae shows a transition stage during which most of its brightness (~3.4 mag) has occurred on a short timescale of 34 days with a rise rate of 3 mag/month. Gaia 20eae has now started to decay at a rate of 0.3 mag/month. We have detected a strong P Cygni profile in Hα, which indicates the presence of winds originating from regions close to the accretion. We find signatures of very strong and turbulent outflow and accretion in Gaia 20eae during this outburst phase. We have also detected a redshifted absorption component in all of the Ca II IR triplet lines consistent with a signature of hot infalling gas in the magnetospheric accretion funnel. This enables us to constrain the viewing angle with respect to the accretion funnel. Our investigation of Gaia 20eae points toward magnetospheric accretion being the phenomenon for the current outburst.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926...68G
The Early Phases of Supernova 2020pni: Shock Ionization of the Nitrogen-enriched Circumstellar Material;;We present multiwavelength observations of the Type II SN 2020pni. Classified at ~1.3 days after explosion, the object showed narrow (FWHM intensity <250 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) recombination lines of ionized helium, nitrogen, and carbon, as typically seen in flash-spectroscopy events. Using the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN to model our first high-resolution spectrum, we infer a progenitor mass-loss rate of \dot{M}=(3.5\mbox{--}5.3)\times {10}^{-3}$ M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> (assuming a wind velocity of v <SUB> w </SUB> = 200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), estimated at a radius of R <SUB>in</SUB> = 2.5 × 10<SUP>14</SUP> cm. In addition, we find that the progenitor of SN 2020pni was enriched in helium and nitrogen (relative abundances in mass fractions of 0.30-0.40 and 8.2 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP>, respectively). Radio upper limits are also consistent with dense circumstellar material (CSM) and a mass-loss rate of \dot{M} 5\times {10}^{-4}\,{M}_{\odot }\,{{\rm{yr}}}^{-1}$ . During the initial 4 days after first light, we also observe an increase in velocity of the hydrogen lines (from ~250 to ~1000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), suggesting complex CSM. The presence of dense and confined CSM, as well as its inhomogeneous structure, indicates a phase of enhanced mass loss of the progenitor of SN 2020pni during the last year before explosion. Finally, we compare SN 2020pni to a sample of other shock-photoionization events. We find no evidence of correlations among the physical parameters of the explosions and the characteristics of the CSM surrounding the progenitors of these events. This favors the idea that the mass loss experienced by massive stars during their final years could be governed by stochastic phenomena and that, at the same time, the physical mechanisms responsible for this mass loss must be common to a variety of different progenitors.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926...20T
The Fast Evolving, Tremendous Blue Superoutburst in ASASSN-21au Reveals a Dichotomy in the Outbursts of Long-period AM CVns;;ASASSN-21au is an ultracompact accreting white dwarf binary (AM CVn type) with a period of ~58 minutes. Using multiwavelength observations of the system, we discovered a dichotomy in the behavior of outbursts in AM CVns. The binary showed an initial increase in brightness that lasted for at least 82 days, followed by an additional increase that lasted two weeks. Afterward, ASASSN-21au went into superoutburst with a total duration of 19 days, showing an amplitude with respect to quiescence of ~7.5 mag in g, with a precursor and an echo outburst. A correlation between X-rays, UV, and optical was identified for the first time in an AM CVn during this stage. The color evolution of ASASSN-21au indicates that during the superoutburst the dominant component was the accretion disk. The short duration, large amplitude, and color evolution of the superoutburst agree with expectations from the disk instability model. These characteristics are opposite to those observed in SDSS J080710+485259 and SDSS J113732+405458, which have periods of ~53 minutes and ~60 minutes, respectively. The initially slow increase in brightness in the light curve of ASASSN-21au and the behavior after the superoutburst favor a scenario in which changes in the mass-transfer rate led to disk instabilities, while the outburst mechanism of SDSS J080710+485259 and SDSS J113732+405458 has been attributed to enhanced mass transfer alone. Further observations are needed to understand the origin of this dichotomy.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...926...10R
Discovery of a Double-detonation Thermonuclear Supernova Progenitor;;We present the discovery of a new double-detonation progenitor system consisting of a hot subdwarf B (sdB) binary with a white dwarf companion with a P <SUB>orb</SUB> = 76.34179(2) minutes orbital period. Spectroscopic observations are consistent with an sdB star during helium core burning residing on the extreme horizontal branch. Chimera light curves are dominated by ellipsoidal deformation of the sdB star and a weak eclipse of the companion white dwarf. Combining spectroscopic and light curve fits, we find a low-mass sdB star, M <SUB>sdB</SUB> = 0.383 ± 0.028 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> with a massive white dwarf companion, M <SUB>WD</SUB> = 0.725 ± 0.026 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. From the eclipses we find a blackbody temperature for the white dwarf of 26,800 K resulting in a cooling age of ≈25 Myr whereas our MESA model predicts an sdB age of ≈170 Myr. We conclude that the sdB formed first through stable mass transfer followed by a common envelope which led to the formation of the white dwarf companion ≈25 Myr ago. Using the MESA stellar evolutionary code we find that the sdB star will start mass transfer in ≈6 Myr and in ≈60 Myr the white dwarf will reach a total mass of 0.92 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> with a thick helium layer of 0.17 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. This will lead to a detonation that will likely destroy the white dwarf in a peculiar thermonuclear supernova. PTF1 J2238+7430 is only the second confirmed candidate for a double-detonation thermonuclear supernova. Using both systems we estimate that at least ≈1% of white dwarf thermonuclear supernovae originate from sdB+WD binaries with thick helium layers, consistent with the small number of observed peculiar thermonuclear explosions.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925L..12K
SN 2020sck: Deflagration in a Carbon-Oxygen White Dwarf;;We present optical UBVRI photometry and low-to-medium resolution spectroscopic observations of type Iax supernova SN 2020sck spanning -5.5 days to +67 days from maximum light in the B-band. From the photometric analysis we find Δm <SUB> B </SUB>(15) = 2.03 ± 0.05 mag and M <SUB> B </SUB> = -17.81 ± 0.22 mag. Radiation diffusion model fit to the quasi-bolometric light curve indicates 0.13 ± 0.02 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni and 0.34 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> of ejecta are synthesized in the explosion. Comparing the observed quasi-bolometric light curve with the angle-averaged bolometric light curve of a three-dimensional pure deflagration explosion of M <SUB>ch</SUB> carbon-oxygen white dwarf, we find agreement with a model in which 0.16 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni and 0.37 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> of ejecta is formed. By comparing the +1.4 days spectrum of SN 2020sck with synthetic spectrum generated using SYN++, we find absorption features due to C II, C III, and O I. These are unburned materials in the explosion and indicate a C-O white dwarf. One-dimensional radiative transfer modeling of the spectra with TARDIS shows higher density in the ejecta near the photosphere and a steep decrease in the outer layers with an ejecta composition dominated mostly by C, O, Si, Fe, and Ni. The star-formation rate of the host galaxy computed from the luminosity of the Hα (λ6563) line is 0.09 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, indicating a relatively young stellar environment.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925..217D
A Matched Survey for the Enigmatic Low Radio Frequency Transient ILT J225347+862146;;Discovered in 2011 with LOFAR, the 15 Jy low-frequency radio transient ILT J225347+862146 heralds a potentially prolific population of radio transients at <100 MHz. However, subsequent transient searches in similar parameter space yielded no detections. We test the hypothesis that these surveys at comparable sensitivity have missed the population due to mismatched survey parameters. In particular, the LOFAR survey used only 195 kHz of bandwidth at 60 MHz, while other surveys were at higher frequencies or had wider bandwidth. Using 137 hr of all-sky images from the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array, we conduct a narrowband transient search at ~10 Jy sensitivity with timescales from 10 minutes to 1 day and a bandwidth of 722 kHz at 60 MHz. To model the remaining survey selection effects, we introduce a flexible Bayesian approach for inferring transient rates. We do not detect any transient and find compelling evidence that our nondetection is inconsistent with the detection of ILT J225347+862146. Under the assumption that the transient is astrophysical, we propose two hypotheses that may explain our nondetection. First, the transient population associated with ILT J225347+862146 may have a low all-sky density and display strong temporal clustering. Second, ILT J225347+862146 may be an extreme instance of the fluence distribution, of which we revise the surface density estimate at 15 Jy to 1.1 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> deg<SUP>-2</SUP> with a 95% credible interval of (3.5 × 10<SUP>-12</SUP>, 3.4 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP>) deg<SUP>-2</SUP>. Finally, we find a previously identified object coincident with ILT J225347+862146 to be an M dwarf at 420 pc.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...925..171H
A Search for Planet Nine using the Zwicky Transient Facility Public Archive;;Recent estimates of the characteristics of Planet Nine have suggested that it could be closer than originally assumed. Such a Planet Nine would also be brighter than originally assumed, suggesting the possibility that it has already been observed in wide-field moderate-depth surveys. We search for Planet Nine in the Zwicky Transient Facility public archive and find no candidates. Using known asteroids to calculate the magnitude limit of the survey, we find that we should have detected Planet Nine throughout most of the northern portion of its predicted orbit-including within the galactic plane-to a 95% detection efficiency of approximately V = 20.5. To aid in understanding detection limits for this and future analyses, we present a full-sky synthetic Planet Nine population drawn from a statistical sampling of predicted Planet Nine orbits. We use this reference population to estimate that this survey rules out 56% of predicted Planet Nine phase space, and we demonstrate how future analyses can use the same synthetic population to continue to constrain the amount of parameter space effectively searched for Planet Nine.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163..102B
Finding Fast Transients in Real Time Using a Novel Light-curve Analysis Algorithm;;The current data acquisition rate of astronomical transient surveys and the promise for significantly higher rates in the next decade necessitate the development of novel approaches to analyze astronomical data sets and promptly detect objects of interest. The Deeper, Wider, Faster (DWF) program is a survey focused on the identification of fast-evolving transients, such as fast radio bursts, gamma-ray bursts, and supernova shock breakouts. It employs multifrequency simultaneous coverage of the same part of the sky over several orders of magnitude. Using the Dark Energy Camera mounted on the 4 m Blanco telescope, DWF captures a 20 s g-band exposure every minute, at a typical seeing of ~1″ and an air mass of ~1.5. These optical data are collected simultaneously with observations conducted over the entire electromagnetic spectrum-from radio to γ-rays-as well as cosmic-ray observations. In this paper, we present a novel real-time light-curve analysis algorithm, designed to detect transients in the DWF optical data; this algorithm functions independently from, or in conjunction with, image subtraction. We present a sample of fast transients detected by our algorithm, as well as a false-positive analysis. Our algorithm is customizable and can be tuned to be sensitive to transients evolving over different timescales and flux ranges.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163...95S
An Eccentric Brown Dwarf Eclipsing an M dwarf;;We report the discovery of an M = 67 ± 2M <SUB>J</SUB> brown dwarf transiting the early M dwarf TOI-2119 on an eccentric orbit (e = 0.3362 ± 0.0005) at an orbital period of 7.200861 ± 0.000005 days. We confirm the brown dwarf nature of the transiting companion using a combination of ground-based and space-based photometry and high-precision velocimetry from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder. Detection of the secondary eclipse with TESS photometry enables a precise determination of the eccentricity and reveals the brown dwarf has a brightness temperature of 2100 ± 80 K, a value which is consistent with an early L dwarf. TOI-2119 is one of the most eccentric known brown dwarfs with P < 10 days, possibly due to the long circularization timescales for an object orbiting an M dwarf. We assess the prospects for determining the obliquity of the host star to probe formation scenarios and the possibility of additional companions in the system using Gaia EDR3 and our radial velocities.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163...89C
Photometric Classification of Early-time Supernova Light Curves with SCONE;;In this work, we present classification results on early supernova light curves from SCONE, a photometric classifier that uses convolutional neural networks to categorize supernovae (SNe) by type using light-curve data. SCONE is able to identify SN types from light curves at any stage, from the night of initial alert to the end of their lifetimes. Simulated LSST SNe light curves were truncated at 0, 5, 15, 25, and 50 days after the trigger date and used to train Gaussian processes in wavelength and time space to produce wavelength-time heatmaps. SCONE uses these heatmaps to perform six-way classification between SN types Ia, II, Ibc, Ia-91bg, Iax, and SLSN-I. SCONE is able to perform classification with or without redshift, but we show that incorporating redshift information improves performance at each epoch. SCONE achieved 75% overall accuracy at the date of trigger (60% without redshift), and 89% accuracy 50 days after trigger (82% without redshift). SCONE was also tested on bright subsets of SNe (r < 20 mag) and produced 91% accuracy at the date of trigger (83% without redshift) and 95% five days after trigger (94.7% without redshift). SCONE is the first application of convolutional neural networks to the early-time photometric transient classification problem. All of the data processing and model code developed for this paper can be found in the SCONE software package<SUP> 1 </SUP> 1 github.com/helenqu/scone located at github.com/helenqu/scone (Qu 2021).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163...57Q
Forecast for cosmological parameter estimation with gravitational-wave standard sirens from the LISA-Taiji network;;LISA and Taiji are expected to form a space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detection network in the future. In this work, we make a forecast for the cosmological parameter estimation with the standard siren observation from the LISA-Taiji network. We simulate the standard siren data based on a scenario with configuration angle of 40° between LISA and Taiji. Three models for the population of massive black hole binary (MBHB), i.e., pop III, Q3d, and Q3nod, are considered to predict the events of MBHB mergers. We find that, based on the LISA-Taiji network, the number of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts detected is almost doubled compared with the case of single Taiji mission. Therefore, the LISA-Taiji network's standard siren observation could provide much tighter constraints on cosmological parameters. For example, solely using the standard sirens from the LISA-Taiji network, the constraint precision of H<SUB>0</SUB> could reach 1.3%. Moreover, combined with the CMB data, the GW-EM observation based on the LISA-Taiji network could also tightly constrain the equation of state of dark energy, e.g., the constraint precision of w reaches about 4%, which is comparable with the result of CMB+BAO+SN. It is concluded that the GW standard sirens from the LISA-Taiji network will become a useful cosmological probe in understanding the nature of dark energy in the future.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022SCPMA..6510411W
The Variability of the Narrow-line Seyfert 1 Galaxies from the Pan-STARRS's View;;By means of the data sets from the Pan-STARRS1 survey, we have systematically examined the relationship between the variability characteristics and the physical parameters of the largest NLS1 galaxy sample up to now. The results are summarized as follows: (1). We find significant anti-correlations between variability amplitude and absolute magnitude in g, r, i, z and y bands, which are consistent with the results in previous works. (2) The correlations between the variability amplitude in optical band and many physical parameters (e.g., λ L(5100 Å), black hole mass, Eddington ratio, R <SUB>4570</SUB> and R <SUB>5007</SUB>) are investigated. The results show the variability amplitude is significantly anti-correlated with L(5100 Å), M <SUB>BH</SUB>, Eddington ratio and R <SUB>4570</SUB>, but positively correlated with R <SUB>5007</SUB>. The relation could be explained by the simple standard accretion disk model. (3) We further investigate the relationship between optical variability and radio luminosity/radio-loudness. The results present weak positive correlation in g and r bands, but insignificant correlation in i, z and y bands. The large error of the approximate fraction of the host galaxy in i, z and y bands may lead to insignificant correlations.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022RAA....22a5014W
Role of Topocentric Parallax in Near-Earth Object Initial Orbit Determination;;Near-Earth Object (NEO) initial orbit determination typically uses astrometric measurements during a close approach over a time window much shorter than the orbital period of the NEO. The initial orbit is only weakly determined with dominant uncertainties in the distance of the NEO from the Earth. Topocentric astrometric measurements allow us to estimate NEO distances using observed nonlinear motions of the NEOs relative to observers, which come from the relative orbital motion of the NEOs to the Earth plus the topocentric parallax (parallax) from the diversity of observatory locations relative to the Earth center. We calculate the ratio of the contributions to the nonlinear motion from the relative orbital motion and the parallax to be approximately (TΔ/(day au))<SUP>2</SUP>, where T is the arc length measured in days and Δ is the distance of close approach. The dominant nonlinear motion for ranging the NEO comes from the relative orbital motion of the NEO to the Earth center, due to mainly the differential solar gravitational acceleration, when TΔ ≳ 1 day au and the parallax when TΔ ≲ 1 day au. This is confirmed by simulation data and supported by observational data of real NEOs. In the regime TΔ ≲ 1 day au, the orbit determination uncertainties are inversely proportional to the amplitude of the parallax. Introducing diversities of hour angles and observatory latitudes (especially alternating between extreme values) into scheduled follow-up observations can improve the parallax amplitude, thus the orbit accuracy. Most of the newly discovered NEOs are in this regime, we recommend optimizing parallax by properly scheduling observations when the NEO is very close to the Earth and using synthetic tracking to improve astrometry accuracy for initial orbit determination.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022PASP..134a5005Z
A WC/WO star exploding within an expanding carbon-oxygen-neon nebula;;The final fate of massive stars, and the nature of the compact remnants they leave behind (black holes and neutron stars), are open questions in astrophysics. Many massive stars are stripped of their outer hydrogen envelopes as they evolve. Such Wolf-Rayet stars<SUP>1</SUP> emit strong and rapidly expanding winds with speeds greater than 1,000 kilometres per second. A fraction of this population is also helium-depleted, with spectra dominated by highly ionized emission lines of carbon and oxygen (types WC/WO). Evidence indicates that the most commonly observed supernova explosions that lack hydrogen and helium (types Ib/Ic) cannot result from massive WC/WO stars<SUP>2,3</SUP>, leading some to suggest that most such stars collapse directly into black holes without a visible supernova explosion<SUP>4</SUP>. Here we report observations of SN 2019hgp, beginning about a day after the explosion. Its short rise time and rapid decline place it among an emerging population of rapidly evolving transients<SUP>5-8</SUP>. Spectroscopy reveals a rich set of emission lines indicating that the explosion occurred within a nebula composed of carbon, oxygen and neon. Narrow absorption features show that this material is expanding at high velocities (greater than 1,500 kilometres per second), requiring a compact progenitor. Our observations are consistent with an explosion of a massive WC/WO star, and suggest that massive Wolf-Rayet stars may be the progenitors of some rapidly evolving transients.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Natur.601..201G
Eclipsing white dwarf binaries in Gaia and the Zwicky Transient Faaccility;;Gaia provided the largest ever catalogue of white dwarf stars. We use this catalogue, along with the third public data release of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), to identify new eclipsing white dwarf binaries. Our method exploits light-curve statistics and the box least-squares algorithm to detect periodic light-curve variability. The search revealed 18 new binaries, of which 17 are eclipsing. We use the position in the Gaia H-R diagram to classify these binaries and find that the majority of these white dwarfs have MS companions. We identify one system as a candidate eclipsing white dwarf-brown dwarf binary and a further two as extremely low-mass white dwarf binaries. We also provide identification spectroscopy for 17 of our 18 binaries. Running our search method on mock light curves with real ZTF sampling, we estimate our efficiency of detecting objects with light curves similar to the ones of the newly discovered binaries. Many more binaries are to be found in the ZTF footprint as the data releases grow, so our survey is ongoing.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.4171K
ASAS-SN search for optical counterparts of gravitational-wave events from the third observing run of Advanced LIGO/Virgo;;We report on the search for electromagnetic counterparts to the nine gravitational-wave events with a >60 per cent probability of containing a neutron star during the third observing run (O3) of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)-Virgo Collaboration (LVC) with the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN). No optical counterparts associated with a gravitational-wave event were found. However, thanks to its network of telescopes, the average area visible to at least one ASAS-SN site during the first 10 h after the trigger contained ~30 per cent of the integrated source location probability. Through a combination of normal operations and target-of-opportunity observations, ASAS-SN observations of the highest probability fields began within 1 h of the trigger for four of the events. After 24 h, ASAS-SN observed >60 per cent of total probability for three events and >40 per cent for all but one of the events. This is the largest area coverage to a depth of g = 18.5 mag from any survey with published coverage statistics for seven of the nine events. With its observing strategy, five sites around the world, and a large field of view, ASAS-SN will be one of the leading surveys to optically search for nearby neutron star mergers during LVC fourth observation run (O4).;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.3427D
Variable star classification across the Galactic bulge and disc with the VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea survey;;We present VIVACE, the VIrac VAriable Classification Ensemble, a catalogue of variable stars extracted from an automated classification pipeline for the Vista Variables in the Vía Láctea (VVV) infrared survey of the Galactic bar/bulge and southern disc. Our procedure utilizes a two-stage hierarchical classifier to first isolate likely variable sources using simple variability summary statistics and training sets of non-variable sources from the Gaia early third data release, and then classify candidate variables using more detailed light-curve statistics and training labels primarily from OGLE and VSX. The methodology is applied to point-spread-function photometry for ~490 million light curves from the VIRAC v2 astrometric and photometric catalogue resulting in a catalogue of ~1.4 million likely variable stars, of which ~39 000 are high-confidence (classification probability >0.9) RR Lyrae ab stars, ~8000 RR Lyrae c/d stars, ~187, 000 detached/semi-detached eclipsing binaries, ~18, 000 contact eclipsing binaries, ~1400 classical Cepheid variables and ~2200 Type II Cepheid variables. Comparison with OGLE-4 suggests a completeness of around $90\, \, \mathrm{per\, cent}$ for RRab and $\lesssim 60\, \mathrm{per\, cent}$ for RRc/d, and a misclassification rate for known RR Lyrae stars of around $1\, \mathrm{per\, cent}$ for the high confidence sample. We close with two science demonstrations of our new VIVACE catalogue: first, a brief investigation of the spatial and kinematic properties of the RR Lyrae stars within the disc/bulge, demonstrating the spatial elongation of bar-bulge RR Lyrae stars is in the same sense as the more metal-rich red giant population whilst having a slower rotation rate of $\sim \!40\, \mathrm{km\, s}^{-1}\mathrm{kpc}^{-1}$; and secondly, an investigation of the GaiaEDR3 parallax zero-point using contact eclipsing binaries across the Galactic disc plane and bulge.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.2566M
Minute-cadence observations of the LAMOST fields with the TMTS: I. Methodology of detecting short-period variables and results from the first-year survey;;Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescopes for Survey (TMTS), located at Xinglong Station of NAOC, has a field of view up to 18 deg<SUP>2</SUP>. The TMTS has started to monitor the LAMOST sky areas since 2020, with the uninterrupted observations lasting for about 6 h on average for each sky area and a cadence of about 1 min. Here, we introduce the data analysis and preliminary scientific results for the first-year observations, which covered 188 LAMOST plates ($\approx 1970\, {\rm deg}^2$). These observations have generated over 4.9 million uninterrupted light curves, with at least 100 epochs for each of them. These light curves correspond to 4.26 million Gaia-DR2 sources, among which 285 thousand sources are found to have multi-epoch spectra from the LAMOST. By analysing these light curves with the Lomb-Scargle periodograms, we identify more than 3700 periodic variable star candidates with periods below ≈7.5 h, primarily consisting of eclipsing binaries and δ Scuti stars. Those short-period binaries will provide important constraints on theories of binary evolution and possible sources for space gravitational wave experiments in the future. Moreover, we also identified 42 flare stars by searching rapidly evolving signals in the light curves. The densely sampled light curves from the TMTS allow us to better quantify the shapes and durations for these flares.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.2362L
Light-curve fingerprints: an automated approach to the extraction of X-ray variability patterns with feature aggregation - an example application to GRS 1915+105;;Time series data mining is an important field of research in the era of 'Big Data'. Next generation astronomical surveys will generate data at unprecedented rates, creating the need for automated methods of data analysis. We propose a method of light-curve characterization that employs a pipeline consisting of a neural network with a long-short term memory variational autoencoder architecture and a Gaussian mixture model. The pipeline performs extraction and aggregation of features from light-curve segments into feature vectors of fixed length that we refer to as light-curve 'fingerprints'. This representation can be readily used as input of down-stream machine learning algorithms. We demonstrate the proposed method on a data set of Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of the Galactic black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105, which was chosen because of its observed complex X-ray variability. We find that the proposed method can generate a representation that characterizes the observations and reflects the presence of distinct classes of GRS 1915+105 X-ray flux variability. We find that this representation can be used to perform efficient classification of light curves. We also present how the representation can be used to quantify the similarity of different light curves, highlighting the problem of the popular classification system of GRS 1915+105 observations, which does not account for intermediate class behaviour.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.1269O
El-CID: a filter for gravitational-wave electromagnetic counterpart identification;;As gravitational-wave (GW) interferometers become more sensitive and probe ever more distant reaches, the number of detected binary neutron star mergers will increase. However, detecting more events farther away with GWs does not guarantee corresponding increase in the number of electromagnetic counterparts of these events. Current and upcoming wide-field surveys that participate in GW follow-up operations will have to contend with distinguishing the kilonova (KN) from the ever increasing number of transients they detect, many of which will be consistent with the GW sky-localization. We have developed a novel tool based on a temporal convolutional neural network architecture, trained on sparse early-time photometry and contextual information for Electromagnetic Counterpart Identification (El-CID). The overarching goal for El-CID is to slice through list of new transient candidates that are consistent with the GW sky localization, and determine which sources are consistent with KNe, allowing limited target-of-opportunity resources to be used judiciously. In addition to verifying the performance of our algorithm on an extensive testing sample, we validate it on AT2017gfo - the only EM counterpart of a binary neutron star merger discovered to date - and AT2019npv - a supernova that was initially suspected as a counterpart of the GW event, GW190814, but was later ruled out after further analysis.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509..914C
Astrometric and Photometric Standard Candidates for the Upcoming 4-m International Liquid Mirror Telescope Survey;;The International Liquid Mirror Telescope (ILMT) is a 4-m class survey telescope that has recently achieved first light and is expected to swing into full operations by January 1, 2023. It scans the sky in a fixed 22′ wide strip centered at the declination of 29∘21′41′′ and works in Time Delay Integration (TDI) mode. We present a full catalog of sources in the ILMT strip that can serve as astrometric calibrators. The characteristics of the sources for astrometric calibration are extracted from Gaia EDR3 as it provides a very precise measurement of astrometric properties such as RA (α), Dec (δ), parallax (π), and proper motions (μα∗ & μδ). We have crossmatched the Gaia EDR3 with SDSS DR17 and PanSTARRS-1 (PS1) and supplemented the catalog with apparent magnitudes of these sources in g,r, and i filters. We also present a catalog of spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) magnitudes that may serve as photometric calibrators. The catalogs generated are stored in an SQLite database for query-based access. We also report the offsets in equatorial positions compared to Gaia for an astrometrically calibrated TDI frame observed with the ILMT.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022JAI....1140001D
A photometric study of members of the NEOs Atiras population;;The observation of objects of the Atiras population is a challenge due to the narrow time-window in which observations are possible and, even so, at very low altitudes. This is due to the orbit of these objects, internal to that of the Earth. In this work we present the results of a photometric observational campaign of Atiras aiming to determine their physical parameters using the rotational light curve, the solar phase curve and the photometric spectrum. The period and amplitude have been determined for the asteroids (163693) Atira, (413563) 2005 TG45 and 2017 YH. In the case of (163693) Atira, we have determined a plausible rotational period P = 3 . 1532 ± 0 . 0001 , where the composite light curve presents structure usually related to the presence of a companion, as it has been suggested by radar observations of this asteroid. For asteroids (163693) Atira, (413563) 2005 TG45, (481817) 2008 UL90 and 2018 JB3 it was possible to derive the absolute magnitude and the phase coefficient. The obtained values are similar to those observed for asteroids with intermediate to low albedo. Finally, for asteroid (163693) Atira we have obtained a featureless photometric spectrum which is compatible in the Carvano taxonomic scheme with the Xp, Dp or Cp classes. No appreciable surface variations were observed for this object.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Icar..37214723R
Simulated SPHEREx spectra of asteroids and their implications for asteroid size and reflectance estimation;;We describe the construction and analysis of simulated SPHEREx spectra of Main Belt and Trojan asteroids. SPHEREx will deliver the first all-sky spectral survey at 96 spectral channels between 0.75 μm and 5.0 μm. We have developed a method for correcting SPHEREx asteroid spectra for intrinsic rotational variability that does not require light curves and can enable studies before LSST light curves become available for this purpose. Using these spectra, we predict that SPHEREx will deliver meaningful flux measurements for about 100,000 asteroids, including close to 10,000 objects with high-quality spectra; this dataset will represent an increase over our current sample size by more than an order of magnitude. The main SPHEREx contribution to asteroid science will be derived from taxonomic classifications, detailed spectroscopic analyses involving a number of diagnostic spectral features associated with olivine, pyroxene, hydroxyl, water ice, and organics, and constraints on thermal properties. We argue that all asteroids with currently known orbits, about a million objects, should be included in the SPHEREx forced photometry object list to maximize its science impact. Our tools and the library of simulated spectra are made publicly available.;;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022Icar..37114696I
