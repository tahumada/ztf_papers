1,"The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be a transformative experiment for gravitational wave astronomy, and, as such, it will offer unique opportunities to address many key astrophysical questions in a completely novel way. The synergy with ground-based and space-born instruments in the electromagnetic domain, by enabling multi-messenger observations, will add further to the discovery potential of LISA. The next decade is crucial to prepare the astrophysical community for LISA's first observations. This review outlines the extensive landscape of astrophysical theory, numerical simulations, and astronomical observations that are instrumental for modeling and interpreting the upcoming LISA datastream. To this aim, the current knowledge in three main source classes for LISA is reviewed; ultra-compact stellar-mass binaries, massive black hole binaries, and extreme or interme-diate mass ratio inspirals. The relevant astrophysical processes and the established modeling techniques are summarized. Likewise, open issues and gaps in our understanding of these sources are highlighted, along with an indication of how LISA could help making progress in the different areas. New research avenues that LISA itself, or its joint exploitation with upcoming studies in the electromagnetic domain, will enable, are also illustrated. Improvements in modeling and analysis approaches, such as the combination of numerical simulations and modern data science techniques, are discussed. This review is intended to be a starting point for using LISA as a new discovery tool for understanding our Universe.","Basaltic V-type asteroids are common in the inner part of the Main Asteroid Belt and much less abundant in the mid and outer parts. They are of scientific interest because they sample crusts and mantles of theoretically plentiful differentiated planetesimals that existed in the Solar System four billion years ago. Some Solar System theories suggest that those objects formed in the terrestrial planet region and were then implanted in the main asteroid belt. In consequence, we should observe a large number of fragments of multiple differentiated planetesimals in the inner Main Belt. That region of the Asteroid Belt is filled with V-type fragments; however, they are difficult to tell apart from typical Vestoids and Vesta fugitives. In this work, we focus on physical and dynamical characterization of V-types in the inner Main-Belt and aim to reconcile those properties with the planetesimal formation and evolution theories. <P />We conducted an observing campaign over the years 2013-2022 and obtained photometric observations of V-type asteroids located mostly outside the Vesta family at specific locations of the inner Main Belt (the so-called Cells I and II). The total number of partial dense photometric lightcurves obtained in this study was ∼ 2910. We were able to model ∼100 V-types. We further supplement those data with 133 spins of V-types from the DAMIT database and 237 objects derived from Gaia DR3 (Ďurech &amp; Hanuš 2023). We found 78% ±11% and 38% ±13% retrograde rotators in Cell I and II, respectively. This statistic is remarkably consistent with the numerical simulations of the escape paths of Vesta fugitives that predict 81% retrograde rotators in Cell I and 40% in Cell II after the dynamical integration of 2 Gys. Based on our statistics we conclude that if there are non-Vestoids in the inner main belt, they are likely to be very few. This is consistent with the small fraction of anomalous HED meteorites in meteorite collections, small number of non-Vestoids in the middle and outer Main Belt and points to planetesimal formation location close to the Sun.","We present the first release of the Calar Alto CAFOS direct imaging data, a project led by the Spanish Virtual Observatory with the goal of enhancing the use of the Calar Alto archive by the astrophysics community. Data Release 1 contains 23 903 reduced and astrometrically calibrated images taken from 2008 March to 2019 July with a median of the mean uncertainties in the astrometric calibration of 0.04 arcsec. The catalogue associated to 6132 images in the Sloan griz filters provides accurate astrometry and PSF calibrated photometry for 139 337 point-like detections corresponding to 21 985 different sources extracted from a selection of 2338 good-quality images. The mean internal astrometric and photometric accuracies are 0.05 arcsec and 0.04 mag, respectively. In this work we describe the approach followed to process and calibrate the images, and the construction of the associated catalogue, together with the validation quality tests carried out. Finally, we present three cases to prove the science capabilities of the catalogue: discovery and identification of asteroids, identification of potential transients, and identification of cool and ultracool dwarfs.","We analyse photometric observations of the supernova (SN) impostor SN 2000ch in NGC 3432 covering the time since its discovery. This source was previously observed to have four outbursts in 2000-2010. Observations now reveal at least three additional outbursts in 2004-2007, and 16 outbursts in 2010-2022. Outburst light curves are irregular and multipeaked, exhibiting a wide variety of peak magnitude, duration, and shape. The outbursts after 2008 repeat with a period of 200.7 ± 2 d, while the outburst in 2000 seems to match with a shorter period. The next outburst should occur around January/February 2023. We propose that these periodic eruptions arise from violent interaction around times of periastron in an eccentric binary system, similar to the periastron encounters of η Carinae leading up to its Great Eruption, and resembling the erratic pre-SN eruptions of SN 2009ip. We attribute the irregularity of the eruptions to the interplay between the orbit and the variability of the luminous blue variable (LBV) primary star, wherein each successive periastron pass may have a different intensity or duration due to the changing radius and mass-loss rate of the LBV-like primary. Such outbursts may occasionally be weak or undetectable if the LBV is relatively quiescent at periastron but can be much more extreme when the LBV is active. The observed change in orbital period may be a consequence of mass lost in outbursts. Given the similarity to the progenitor of SN 2009ip, SN 2000ch deserves continued attention in the event it is headed for a stellar merger or an SN-like explosion.","Wide-field time-domain photometric sky surveys are now finding hundreds of eclipsing white dwarf plus M dwarf binaries, a population encompassing a wealth of information and potential insight into white dwarf and close binary astrophysics. Precise follow-up observations are essential in order to fully constrain these systems and capitalize on the power of this sample. We present the first results from our programme of high-speed multiband photometric follow-up. We develop a method to measure temperatures, (model-dependent) masses, and radii for both components from the eclipse photometry alone and characterize 34 white dwarf binaries, finding general agreement with independent estimates using an alternative approach while achieving around a factor of 2 increase in parameter precision. In addition to these parameter estimates, we discover a number of interesting systems - finding four with sub-stellar secondaries, doubling the number of eclipsing examples, and at least six, where we find the white dwarf to be strongly magnetic, making these the first eclipsing examples of such systems and key to investigating the mechanism of magnetic field generation in white dwarfs. We also discover the first two pulsating white dwarfs in detached and eclipsing post-common-envelope binaries - one with a low-mass, likely helium core, and one with a relatively high mass, towards the upper end of the known sample of ZZ Cetis. Our results demonstrate the power of eclipse photometry, not only as a method of characterizing the population, but as a way of discovering important systems that would have otherwise been missed by spectroscopic follow-up.","We present a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the ultraluminous and slowly evolving 03fg-like Type Ia SN 2021zny. Our observational campaign starts from ~5.3 h after explosion (making SN 2021zny one of the earliest observed members of its class), with dense multiwavelength coverage from a variety of ground- and space-based telescopes, and is concluded with a nebular spectrum ~10 months after peak brightness. SN 2021zny displayed several characteristics of its class, such as the peak brightness (M<SUB>B</SUB> = -19.95 mag), the slow decline (Δm<SUB>15</SUB>(B) = 0.62 mag), the blue early-time colours, the low ejecta velocities, and the presence of significant unburned material above the photosphere. However, a flux excess for the first ~1.5 d after explosion is observed in four photometric bands, making SN 2021zny the third 03fg-like event with this distinct behaviour, while its +313 d spectrum shows prominent [O I] lines, a very unusual characteristic of thermonuclear SNe. The early flux excess can be explained as the outcome of the interaction of the ejecta with $\sim 0.04\, \mathrm{M_{\odot }}$ of H/He-poor circumstellar material at a distance of ~10<SUP>12</SUP> cm, while the low ionization state of the late-time spectrum reveals low abundances of stable iron-peak elements. All our observations are in accordance with a progenitor system of two carbon/oxygen white dwarfs that undergo a merger event, with the disrupted white dwarf ejecting carbon-rich circumstellar material prior to the primary white dwarf detonation.","Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are transient, multiwavelength events in which a star is ripped apart by a supermassive black hole. Observations show that in a small fraction of TDEs, a short-lived, synchrotron emitting jet is produced. We observed the newly discovered TDE AT2022cmc with a slew of radio facilities over the first 100 d after its discovery. The light curve from the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array radio interferometer shows day-time-scale variability which we attribute to a high brightness temperature emitting region as opposed to scintillation. We measure a brightness temperature of 2 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> K, which is unphysical for synchrotron radiation. We suggest that the measured high brightness temperature is a result of relativistic beaming caused by a jet being launched at velocities close to the speed of light along our line of sight. We infer from day-time-scale variability that the jet associated with AT2022cmc has a relativistic Doppler factor of at least 16, which corresponds to a bulk Lorentz factor of at least 8, if we are observing the jet directly on axis. Such an inference is the first conclusive evidence that the radio emission observed from some TDEs is from relativistic jets because it does not rely on an outflow model. We also compare the first 100 d of radio evolution of AT2022cmc with that of the previous bright relativistic TDE,Swift J1644, and find a remarkable similarity in their evolution.","We study the optical variability of a sample of candidate low-mass (dwarf and Seyfert) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using Zwicky Transient Facility g-band light curves. Our sample is compiled from broad-line AGNs in dwarf galaxies reported in the literature with single-epoch virial black hole (BH) masses in the range M<SUB>BH</SUB> ~ 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We measure the characteristic 'damping' time-scale of the optical variability τ<SUB>DRW</SUB>, beyond which the power spectral density flattens, of a final sample of 79 candidate low-mass AGNs with high-quality light curves. Our results provide further confirmation of the M<SUB>BH</SUB>-τ<SUB>DRW</SUB> relation from previous work within 1σ agreement, adding 78 new low-mass AGNs to the relation. The agreement suggests that the virial BH mass estimates for these AGNs are generally reasonable. We expect that the optical light curve of an accreting intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) to vary with a rest-frame damping time-scale of ~tens of hours, which could enable detection and direct mass estimation of accreting IMBHs in wide-field time-domain imaging surveys with sufficient cadence like with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.","AST3-2 is the second of the three Antarctic Survey Telescopes, aimed at wide-field time-domain optical astronomy. It is located at Dome A, Antarctica, which is by many measures the best optical astronomy site on the Earth's surface. Here we present the data from the AST3-2 automatic survey in 2016 and the photometry results. The median 5σ limiting magnitude in i-band is 17.8 mag and the light-curve precision is 4 mmag for bright stars. The data release includes photometry for over 7 million stars, from which over 3500 variable stars were detected, with 70 of them newly discovered. We classify these new variables into different types by combining their light-curve features with stellar properties from surveys such as StarHorse.","Strong magnetic fields are observed in a substantial fraction of upper main sequence stars and white dwarfs. Many such stars are observed to exhibit photometric modulations as the magnetic poles rotate in and out of view, which could be a consequence of magnetic perturbations to the star's thermal structure. The magnetic pressure is typically larger than the gas pressure at the star's photosphere, but much smaller than the gas pressure in the star's interior, so the expected surface flux perturbations are not clear. We compute magnetically perturbed stellar structures of young $3 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ stars that are in both hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium, and which contain both poloidal and toroidal components of a dipolar magnetic field as expected for stable fossil fields. This provides semi-analytical models of such fields in baroclinic stably stratified regions. The star's internal pressure, temperature, and flux perturbations can have a range of magnitudes, though we argue the most likely configurations exhibit flux perturbations much smaller than the ratio of surface magnetic pressure to surface gas pressure, but much larger than the ratio of surface magnetic pressure to central gas pressure. The magnetic pole is hotter than the equator in our models, but a cooler magnetic pole is possible depending on the magnetic field configuration. The expected flux variations for observed field strengths are δL/L ≲ 10<SUP>-6</SUP>, much smaller than those observed in magnetic stars, suggesting that observed perturbations stem from changes to the emergent spectrum rather than changes to the bolometric flux.","This paper is one in a series reporting results from small telescope observations of variable young stars. Here, we study the repeating outbursts of three likely Be stars based on long-term optical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared photometry for all three objects, along with follow-up spectra for two of the three. The sources are characterized as rare, truly regularly outbursting Be stars. We interpret the photometric data within a framework for modelling light-curve morphology, and find that the models correctly predict the burst shapes, including their larger amplitudes and later peaks towards longer wavelengths. We are thus able to infer the start and end times of mass loading into the circumstellar discs of these stars. The disc sizes are typically 3 - 6 times the areas of the central star. The disc temperatures are ~40 per cent, and the disc luminosities are ~10 per cent of those of the central Be star, respectively. The available spectroscopy is consistent with inside-out evolution of the disc. Higher excitation lines have larger velocity widths in their double-horned shaped emission profiles. Our observations and analysis support the decretion disc model for outbursting Be stars.","Age is a stellar parameter that is both fundamental and difficult to determine. Among middle-aged M dwarfs, the most prolific hosts of close-in and detectable exoplanets, gyrochronology is the most promising method to assign ages, but requires calibration by rotation-temperature sequences (gyrochrones) in clusters of known ages. We curated a catalogue of 249 late K- and M-type (T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3200-4200 K) exoplanet host stars with established rotation periods, and applied empirical, temperature-dependent rotation-age relations based on relevant published gyrochrones, including one derived from observations of the 4-Gyr-old open cluster M67. We estimated ages for 227 of these stars, and upper limits for eight others, excluding 14 which are too rapidly rotating or are otherwise outside the valid parameter range of our gyrochronology. We estimated uncertainties based on observed scatter in rotation periods in young clusters, error in the gyrochrones, and uncertainties in temperature and non-solar metallicity. For those stars with measured metallicities, we provide but do not incorporate a correction for the effects of deviation from solar-metallicity. The age distribution of our sample declines to near zero at 10 Gyr, the age of the Galactic disc, with the handful of outliers explainable by large uncertainties. Continued addition or extension of cluster rotation sequences to more thoroughly calibrate the gyrochronology in time and temperature space, more precise and robust measurement of rotation periods, and more accurate stellar parameter measurements will enable continued improvements in the age estimates of these important exoplanet host stars.","We catalogue the 443 bright supernovae (SNe) discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) in 2018-2020 along with the 519 SNe recovered by ASAS-SN and 516 additional m<SUB>peak</SUB> ≤ 18 mag SNe missed by ASAS-SN. Our statistical analysis focuses primarily on the 984 SNe discovered or recovered in ASAS-SN g-band observations. The complete sample of 2427 ASAS-SN SNe includes earlier V-band samples and unrecovered SNe. For each SN, we identify the host galaxy, its UV to mid-IR photometry, and the SN's offset from the centre of the host. Updated peak magnitudes, redshifts, spectral classifications, and host galaxy identifications supersede earlier results. With the increase of the limiting magnitude to g ≤ 18 mag, the ASAS-SN sample is nearly complete up to m<SUB>peak</SUB> = 16.7 mag and is 90 per cent complete for m<SUB>peak</SUB> ≤ 17.0 mag. This is an increase from the V-band sample, where it was roughly complete up to m<SUB>peak</SUB> = 16.2 mag and 70 per cent complete for m<SUB>peak</SUB> ≤ 17.0 mag.","We report on multiwavelength observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate eRASSt J074426.3 + 291606 (J0744), located in the nucleus of a previously quiescent galaxy at z = 0.0396. J0744 was first detected as a new, ultra-soft X-ray source (photon index ~4) during the second SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS2), where it had brightened in the 0.3-2 keV band by a factor of more than ~160 relative to an archival 3σ upper limit inferred from a serendipitous Chandra pointing in 2011. The transient was also independently found in the optical by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), with the eRASS2 detection occurring only ~20 d after the peak optical brightness, suggesting that the accretion disc formed promptly in this TDE. Continued X-ray monitoring over the following ~400 d by eROSITA, NICER XTI and Swift XRT showed a net decline by a factor of ~100, albeit with large amplitude X-ray variability where the system fades, and then rebrightens, in the 0.3-2 keV band by a factor ~50 during an 80-d period. Contemporaneous Swift UVOT observations during this extreme X-ray variability reveal a relatively smooth decline, which persists over ~400 d post-optical peak. The peak observed optical luminosity (absolute g-band magnitude ~-16.8 mag) from this transient makes J0744 the faintest optically detected TDE observed to date. However, contrasting the known set of 'faint and fast' TDEs, the optical emission from J0744 decays slowly (exponential decay time-scale ~120 d), making J0744 the first member of a potential new class of 'faint and slow' TDEs.","In this work, we search for negative superhumps (nSHs) in poorly studied cataclysmic variables using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data. We find three eclipsing binaries with nSH signatures: HBHA 4204-09, Gaia DR3 5931071148325476992, and SDSS J090113.51+144704.6. The last one exhibits IW And-like behaviour in archival Zwicky Transient Facility data, and appears to have shallow, grazing eclipses. In addition, we detect nSH signatures in two non-eclipsing systems: KQ Mon and Gaia DR3 4684361817175293440, by identifying the orbital period from the superorbital-dependent irradiation of the secondary. We discover nSH signatures in one more system, [PK2008] HalphaJ103959, by using an orbital period from another work. An improved mass ratio-nSH deficit relation q(ɛ<SUB>-</SUB>) is suggested by us, which agrees with independent measurements on nova-like variables. With this relation, we estimate the mass ratios of all systems in our sample, and determine the orbital inclinations for the three that are eclipsing. All systems with discovered nSHs in this work are excellent targets for follow-up spectroscopic studies.","We present extensive optical/ultraviolet observations and modelling analysis for the nearby SN 1987A-like peculiar Type II supernova (SN) 2018hna. Both photometry and spectroscopy covered phases extending to &gt;500 d after the explosion, making it one of the best-observed SN II of this subtype. SN 2018hna is obviously bluer than SN 1987A during the photospheric phase, suggesting higher photospheric temperature, which may account for weaker Ba II λ6142 lines in its spectra. Analysis of early-time temperature evolution suggests a radius of ~45 R<SUB>⊙</SUB> for the progenitor of SN 2018hna, consistent with a blue supergiant (BSG). By fitting the bolometric light curve with hydrodynamical models, we find that SN 2018hna has an ejecta mass of ~(13.7-17.7) M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, a kinetic energy of ~(1.0-1.2) × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg, and a <SUP>56</SUP>Ni mass of about 0.05 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Moreover, based on standard stellar evolution and the oxygen mass (0.44-0.73 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) deduced from nebular [O I] lines, the progenitor of SN 2018hna is expected to have an initial main-sequence mass &lt;16 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. In principle, such a relatively low-mass star cannot end as a BSG just before core-collapse, except some unique mechanisms are involved, such as rapid rotation, restricted semiconvection, etc. On the other hand, binary scenario may be more favourable, like in the case of SN 1987A. While the much lower oxygen mass inferred for SN 2018hna may imply that its progenitor system also had much lower initial masses than that of SN 1987A.","As we observe a rapidly growing number of astrophysical transients, we learn more about the diverse host galaxy environments in which they occur. Host galaxy information can be used to purify samples of cosmological Type Ia supernovae, uncover the progenitor systems of individual classes, and facilitate low-latency follow-up of rare and peculiar explosions. In this work, we develop a novel data-driven methodology to simulate the time-domain sky that includes detailed modelling of the probability density function for multiple transient classes conditioned on host galaxy magnitudes, colours, star formation rates, and masses. We have designed these simulations to optimize photometric classification and analysis in upcoming large synoptic surveys. We integrate host galaxy information into the SNANA simulation framework to construct the simulated catalogue of optical transients and correlated hosts (SCOTCH, a publicly available catalogue of 5-million idealized transient light curves in LSST passbands and their host galaxy properties over the redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 3. This catalogue includes supernovae, tidal disruption events, kilonovae, and active galactic nuclei. Each light curve consists of true top-of-the-galaxy magnitudes sampled with high (≲2 d) cadence. In conjunction with SCOTCH, we also release an associated set of tutorials and transient-specific libraries to enable simulations of arbitrary space- and ground-based surveys. Our methodology is being used to test critical science infrastructure in advance of surveys by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Nancy G. Roman Space Telescope.","Cross-referencing a watch list of galaxy groups and clusters with transient detections from real-time streams of wide-field survey data is a promising method for discovering gravitationally lensed explosive transients, including supernovae, kilonovae, gravitational waves, and gamma-ray bursts in the next 10 yr. However, currently there exists no catalogue of objects with both sufficient angular extent and depth to adequately perform such a search. In this study, we develop a cluster-finding method capable of creating an all-sky list of galaxy group- and cluster-scale objects out to z ≃ 1 based on their lens-plane properties and using only existing data from wide-field infrared surveys such as VISTA Hemisphere Survey and UKIRT Hemisphere Survey, and all-sky WISE (Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer) data. In testing this method, we recover 91 per cent of a sample containing known and candidate lensing objects with Einstein radii of θ<SUB>E</SUB> ≥ 5 arcsec. We also search the surrounding regions of this test sample for other groups and clusters using our method and verify the existence of any significant findings by visual inspection, deriving estimates of the false positive rate that are as low as 6 per cent. The method is also tested on simulated Rubin data from their Data Preview 0 programme, which yields complementary results of a good recovery rate of ≳80 per cent for M<SUB>200</SUB> ≥ 7 × 10<SUP>13</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> clusters and with no false positives produced in our test region. Importantly, our method is positioned to create a watch list in advance of Rubin's LSST, as it utilizes only existing data, therefore enabling the discovery of lensed transients early within the survey's lifetime.","AT 2019avd is a nuclear transient detected from infrared to soft X-rays, though its nature is yet unclear. The source has shown two consecutive flaring episodes in the optical and the infrared bands, and its second flare was covered by X-ray monitoring programs. During this flare, the UVOT/Swift photometries revealed two plateaus: one observed after the peak and the other one appeared ~240 d later. Meanwhile, our NICER and XRT/Swift campaigns show two declines in the X-ray emission, one during the first optical plateau and one 70-90 d after the optical/UV decline. The evidence suggests that the optical/UV could not have been primarily originated from X-ray reprocessing. Furthermore, we detected a timelag of ~16-34 d between the optical and UV emission, which indicates the optical likely comes from UV reprocessing by a gas at a distance of 0.01-0.03 pc. We also report the first VLA and VLBA detection of this source at different frequencies and different stages of the second flare. The information obtained in the radio band - namely a steep and a late-time inverted radio spectrum, a high brightness temperature and a radio-loud state at late times - together with the multiwavelength properties of AT 2019avd suggests the launching and evolution of outflows such as disc winds or jets. In conclusion, we propose that after the ignition of black hole activity in the first flare, a super-Eddington flaring accretion disc formed and settled to a sub-Eddington state by the end of the second flare, associated with a compact radio outflow.","Detached eclipsing binaries are the primary tool used to measure precise masses and radii of stars. In our previous paper estimating the parameters of more than 30 000 detached eclipsing binaries, we identified 766 eclipsing binaries with additional features in their All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite light curves. Here, we characterize these 'extra-physics' systems, identifying eclipsing binaries with spotted stars, pulsating components, and candidate triple/quadruple systems. We use the Gaia, Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), and ASAS-SN variable star catalogues to search for possible blends. We use MIST (MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks) isochrones and evolutionary tracks to identify systems with main-sequence, subgiant, and giant primaries and highlight systems in sparsely populated regions of the colour-magnitude diagram. We find that the orbital period distribution of spotted binaries is divided by evolutionary state and find 68 with X-ray detections. For the candidate triple/quadruples and pulsating systems, we calculate the extra orbital/pulsational period and identify systems with resonances. Finally, we highlight a number of exotic systems, including eclipsing cataclysmic variables, subdwarfs, and binaries with discs.","We report the results of long-term reverberation mapping campaigns of the nearby active galactic nuclei (AGNs) NGC 4151, spanning from 1994 to 2022, based on archived observations of the FAST Spectrograph Publicly Archived Programs and our new observations with the 2.3 m telescope at the Wyoming Infrared Observatory. We reduce and calibrate all the spectra in a consistent way, and derive light curves of the broad H β line and 5100 Å continuum. Continuum light curves are also constructed using public archival photometric data to increase sampling cadences. We subtract the host galaxy contamination using Hubble Space Telescope imaging to correct fluxes of the calibrated light curves. Utilizing the long-term archival photometric data, we complete the absolute flux-calibration of the AGN continuum. We find that the H β time delays are correlated with the 5100 Å luminosities as $\tau _{\rm H\beta }\propto L_{5100}^{0.46\pm 0.16}$. This is remarkably consistent with Bentz et al. (2013)'s global size-luminosity relationship of AGNs. Moreover, the data sets for five of the seasons allow us to obtain the velocity-resolved delays of the H β line, showing diverse structures (outflows, inflows, and discs). Combining our results with previous independent measurements, we find the measured dynamics of the H β broad-line region (BLR) are possibly related to the long-term trend of the luminosity. There is also a possible additional ~1.86 yr time lag between the variation in BLR radius and luminosity. These results suggest that dynamical changes in the BLR may be driven by the effects of radiation pressure.",,"Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are organized into five main classes: Amor, Apollo, Aten, Atira and 'Ayló'chaxnim. Asteroids belonging to the 'Ayló'chaxnim class are located entirely within the orbit of Venus making them difficult to detect by ground-based observatories. The first-known asteroid of this class, (594913) 'Ayló'chaxnim, was discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in 2020 January during a twilight search for asteroids at small solar elongations that ran between September 2019 and January 2020. Due to its large diameter of ∼2 km, the discovery of (594913) 'Ayló'chaxnim is surprising because contemporary NEA population models predict a scarcity of asteroids of this size located inside the orbit of Venus. To compare the discovery of (594913) 'Ayló'chaxnim by ZTF with the predictions of NEA population models, we estimated the ZTF survey completeness at detecting 'Ayló'chaxnim asteroids and the number of 'Ayló'chaxnim asteroids expected to have been discovered by simulating observations of synthetic 'Ayló'chaxnim asteroids. We find that the 'Ayló'chaxnim population completeness of the survey is ∼18% and there is only a 5% probability that a single 'Ayló'chaxnim asteroid would have been discovered. Given the small chance for (594913) 'Ayló'chaxnim to have been discovered, its presence is either a statistical fluke or it implies that asteroid population models may need to be revised.","Short-period comet 108P/Ciffreo is known for its peculiar double morphology, in which the nucleus is accompanied by a comoving, detached, diffuse ""blob."" We report new observations of 108P/Ciffreo taken with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Nordic Optical Telescope and use them to determine the cause of this unusual morphology. The separation and the longevity of the blob across several orbits together rule out the possibility of a single, slow-moving secondary object near the primary nucleus. We use a model of coma particle dynamics under the action of solar gravity and radiation pressure to show that the blob is an artifact of the turnaround of particles ejected sunward and repelled by sunlight. Numerical experiments limit the range of directions which can reproduce the morphology and explain why the comoving blob appearance is rare.","We examine a sample of 340 cataclysmic variables (CVs) from the latest data release of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) survey, along with 18 objects that are newly classified as CVs. In this paper, we focus on investigating the photometric behaviors of these CVs using data from time-domain surveys. The orbital periods of three new and five previously known objects are determined from the long-term light curves displaying eclipses or ellipsoidal variations, and/or time-resolved spectra from LAMOST. For another 16 CVs with measured periods, it is more reliable to obtain consistent periods using light curves from different surveys, as the periods derived from single-site data are still questionable. Follow-up observations are needed to confirm whether the periods have physical meanings or are orbital-related. In our sample, we find that most of the objects have longer periods above the 2 ~ 3 hr gap. Besides period estimates, we also carry out a separate detailed analysis of some valuable CVs, in terms of spectral characteristics and subtype determination. Finally, we discuss the observational properties of this sample, including the distributions of orbital periods, absolute magnitudes, and the statistical properties of each subclass of CVs. In addition, we pick out six non-CV systems, including five illumination-effect binaries, as well as one hot subdwarf, that we came across when searching for CVs, and we investigate their properties based on the spectra and photometric data.","Eleven periodic variable stars were observed photometrically through two to four filters from the set UBVR <SUB> C </SUB> I <SUB> C </SUB>. Phase-folded data for each star cover full cycles of variation. Spectral energy distributions, based on absolute photometry extracted from the literature, are used to inform models of the stars. The stars include four eclipsing systems with hot subdwarfs of spectral type O or B (sdO/B). Periods are in the range 1.8-2.2 hr. Four reflection-effect binaries, with amplitudes as large as 0.5 mag in the R <SUB> C </SUB> filter were observed; periods range from 1.6 to 2.4 hr. In two of these latter systems, the primary stars are also sdB stars, while two have white-dwarf components. In all eight of these binaries the companion stars are probably M dwarfs. The remaining three stars are pulsators: one large-amplitude δ Scuti star previously misclassified as an eclipsing system; one field SX Phe star near the Galactic plane; and one multiperiodic high-luminosity star of unknown type. The amplitude is usually a strong function of the wavelength in pulsating stars, but this is not the case for the high-luminosity variable. One possible explanation is that the luminous star has a pulsating companion. The SX Phe and high-luminosity star are both heavily reddened (A <SUB> V </SUB> &gt; 5 mag).","The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has an exceptionally large plate scale of 21″ px<SUP>-1</SUP>, causing most TESS light curves to record the blended light of multiple stars. This creates a danger of misattributing variability observed by TESS to the wrong source, which would invalidate any analysis. We developed a method that can localize the origin of variability on the sky to better than one fifth of a pixel. Given measured frequencies of variability (e.g., from periodogram analysis), we show that the best-fit sinusoid amplitudes to raw light curves extracted from each pixel are distributed in the same way as light from the variable source. The primary assumption of this method is that other nearby stars are not variable at the same frequencies. Essentially, we are using the high frequency resolution of TESS to overcome limitations from its low spatial resolution. We have implemented our method in an open-source Python package, TESS_localize (github.com/Higgins00/TESS-Localize), that determines the location of a variable source on the sky and the most likely Gaia source given TESS pixel data and a set of observed frequencies of variability. Our method utilizes models of the TESS pixel response function, and we characterize systematics in the residuals of fitting these models to data. We find that even stars more than three pixels outside a photometric aperture can produce significant contaminant signals in the extracted light curves. Given the ubiquity of source blending in TESS light curves, verifying the source of observed variability should be a standard step in TESS analyses.","We report the results of a search for long-period (100 &lt; P &lt; 600 days) periodic variability in the SDSS Stripe 82 standards catalog. The SDSS coverage of Stripe 82 enables such a search because there are on average 20 observations per band in ugriz bands for about one million sources, collected over about 6 yr, with a faint limit of r ~ 22 mag and precisely calibrated 1%-2% photometry. We calculated the periods of variable source candidates in this sample using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and considered the three highest periodogram peaks in each of the gri filters as relevant. Only those sources with gri periods consistent within 0.1% were later studied. We use the Kuiper statistic to ensure uniform distribution of data points in phased light curves. We present five sources with the spectra consistent with quasar spectra and plausible periodic variability. This SDSS-based search bodes well for future sensitive large-area surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, which, due to its larger sky coverage (about a factor of 60) and improved sensitivity (~2 mag), will be more powerful for finding such sources.","We present a systematic analysis to determine and improve the pulsation periods of 1637 known long-period Mira variables in M33 using gri-band light curves spanning ~18 yr from several surveys, including the M33 variability survey, Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), intermediate PTF, and Zwicky Transient Facility. Based on these collections of light curves, we found that optical-band light curves that are as complete as possible are crucial to determine the periods of distant Miras. We demonstrated that the machine-learning techniques can be used to classify Miras into O-rich and C-rich based on the (J - K <SUB> s </SUB>) period-color plane. Finally, We derived the distance modulus to M33 using O-rich Miras at maximum light together with our improved periods as 24.67 ± 0.06 mag, which is in good agreement with the recommended value given in the literature.","Context. Colour-magnitude diagrams reveal a population of blue (hot) sub-luminous objects with respect to the main sequence. These hot sub-luminous stars are the result of evolutionary processes that require stars to expel their obscuring, hydrogen-rich envelopes to reveal the hot helium core. As such, these objects offer a direct window into the hearts of stars that are otherwise inaccessible to direct observation. <BR /> Aims: MeerLICHT is a wide-field optical telescope that collects multi-band photometric data in six band filters (u, g, r, i, z, and q), whose primary goals are to study transient phenomena, gravitational wave counterparts, and variable stars. We showcase MeerLICHT's capabilities of detecting faint hot subdwarfs and identifying the dominant frequency in the photometric variability of these compact hot stars, in comparison to their Gaia DR3 data. We hunt for oscillations, which will be an essential ingredient for accurately probing stellar interiors in future asteroseismology. <BR /> Methods: Comparative MeerLICHT and Gaia colour-magnitude diagrams are presented as a way to select hot subdwarfs from our sample. A dedicated frequency determination technique is developed and applied to the selected candidates to determine their dominant variability using time-series data from MeerLICHT and Gaia DR3. We explore the power of both datasets in determining the dominant frequency. <BR /> Results: Using the g − i colour, MeerLICHT offers a colour-magnitude diagram that is comparable in quality to that of Gaia DR3. The former, however, is more sensitive to fainter objects. The MeerLICHT colour-colour diagrams allow for the study of different stellar populations. The frequency analysis of MeerLICHT and Gaia DR3 data demonstrates the superiority of our MeerLICHT multi-colour photometry in estimating the dominant frequency compared to the sparse Gaia DR3 data. <BR /> Conclusions: MeerLICHT's multi-band photometry leads to the discovery of high-frequency faint subdwarfs. Continued observations tuned to asteroseismology will allow for mode identification using the method of amplitude ratios. Our MeerLICHT results are a proof-of-concept of the capacity of the BlackGEM instrument currently in the commissioning stage at ESO's La Silla Observatory in Chile. <P />A full list of the candidates with their derived periods (full Table A.1) is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=""http://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr"">cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=""https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/672/A69"">https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/672/A69</A>","Casimir energy is always suggested as a possible source to create a traversable wormhole. It is also used to demonstrate the existence of negative energy, which can be created in a lab. To generalize this idea, Yukawa modification of a Casimir source has been considered in Remo Garattini (Eur. Phys. J. C 81 no.9, 824, 2021). In this work, we explore the Yukawa–Casimir wormholes in symmetric teleparallel gravity. We have taken four different forms of f(Q) to obtain wormhole solutions powered by the original Casimir energy source and Yukawa modification of the Casimir energy source. In power law form f(Q)=αQ2+β and quadratic form f(Q)=αQ2+βQ+γ, where α,β,γ are constants and Q is non-metricity scalar, we analyze that wormhole throat is filled with non-exotic matter. We find self-sustained traversable wormholes in the Casimir source where null energy conditions are violated in all specific forms of f(Q), while after Yukawa modification, it is observed that violation of null energy conditions is restricted to some regions in the vicinity of the throat.","Galactic nuclei harbouring a central supermassive black hole (SMBH), possibly surrounded by a dense nuclear cluster (NC), represent extreme environments that house a complex interplay of many physical processes that uniquely affect stellar formation, evolution, and dynamics. The discovery of gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by merging black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs), funnelled a huge amount of work focused on understanding how compact object binaries (COBs) can pair up and merge together. Here, we review from a theoretical standpoint how different mechanisms concur with the formation, evolution, and merger of COBs around quiescent SMBHs and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), summarising the main predictions for current and future (GW) detections and outlining the possible features that can clearly mark a galactic nuclei origin.","A supermassive binary black-hole candidate SDSS J1430+2303 reported recently motivates us to investigate an imminent binary of supermassive black holes as potential gravitational wave source, and the radiated gravitational waves at the end of the merger are shown to be in the band of space-borne detectors. We provide a general analysis on the required detecting sensitivity needed for probing such type gravitational wave sources and make a full discussion by considering two typically designed configurations of space-borne antennas. If a source is so close, it is possible to be detected with Taiji pathfinder-plus which is proposed to be an extension for the planned Taiji pathfinder by just adding an additional satellite to the initial two satellites. The gravitational wave detection on such kind of source enables us to explore the properties of supermassive black holes and the nature of gravity.","Expected to be of the highest survey power telescope in the northern hemisphere, the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) will begin its routine observations of the northern sky since 2023. WFST will produce a lot of scientific data to support the researches of time-domain astronomy, asteroids and the solar system, galaxy formation and cosmology and so on. We estimated that the 5σ limiting magnitudes of WFST with 30 s exposure are u = 22.31 mag, g = 23.42 mag, r = 22.95 mag, i = 22.43 mag, z = 21.50 mag, w = 23.61 mag. The above values are calculated for the conditions of airmass = 1.2, seeing = 0.″75, precipitable water vapor = 2.5 mm and Moon-object separation = 45° at the darkest New Moon night of the Lenghu site (V = 22.30 mag, Moon phase θ = 0°). The limiting magnitudes in different Moon phase conditions are also calculated. The calculations are based on the empirical transmittance data of WFST optics, the vendor provided CCD quantum efficiency, the atmospherical model transmittance and spectrum of the site. In the absence of measurement data such as sky transmittance and spectrum, we use model data.","Jupiter-family comet (JFC) P/2021 HS (PANSTARRS) only exhibits a coma within a few weeks of its perihelion passage at 0.8 au, which is atypical for a comet. Here we present an investigation into the underlying cause using serendipitous survey detections and targeted observations. We find that the detection of the activity is caused by an extremely faint coma being enhanced by the forward scattering effect owing to the comet reaching a phase angle of ~140°. The coma morphology is consistent with sustained, sublimation-driven activity produced by a small active area, ~700 m<SUP>2</SUP>, one of the smallest values ever measured on a comet. The phase function of the nucleus shows a phase coefficient of 0.035 ± 0.002 mag deg<SUP>-1</SUP>, implying an absolute magnitude of H = 18.31 ± 0.04 and a phase slope of G = - 0.13, with color consistent with typical JFC nuclei. Thermal observations suggest a nucleus diameter of 0.6-1.1 km, implying an optical albedo of 0.04-0.23, which is higher than typical cometary nuclei. An unsuccessful search for dust trail and meteor activity confirms minimal dust deposit along the orbit, totaling ≲10<SUP>8</SUP> kg. As P/2021 HS is dynamically unstable, similar to typical JFCs, we speculate that it has an origin in the trans-Neptunian region and that its extreme depletion of volatiles is caused by a large number of previous passages to the inner solar system. The dramatic discovery of the cometary nature of P/2021 HS highlights the challenges of detecting comets with extremely low activity levels. Observations at high phase angle, where forward scattering is pronounced, will help identify such comets.","We report observations of nine main-belt comets (MBCs) or candidate MBCs, most of which were obtained when the targets were apparently inactive. We find effective nucleus radii (assuming albedos of p <SUB> V </SUB> = 0.05 ± 0.02) of r <SUB> n </SUB> = (0.24 ± 0.05) km for 238P/Read, r <SUB> n </SUB> = (0.9 ± 0.2) km for 313P/Gibbs, r <SUB> n </SUB> = (0.6 ± 0.1) km for 324P/La Sagra, r <SUB> n </SUB> = (1.0 ± 0.2) km for 426P/PANSTARRS, r <SUB> n </SUB> = (0.5 ± 0.1) km for 427P/ATLAS, r <SUB> n </SUB> &lt; (0.3 ± 0.1) km for P/2016 J1-A (PANSTARRS), r <SUB> n </SUB> &lt; (0.17 ± 0.04) km for P/2016 J1-B (PANSTARRS), r <SUB> n </SUB> ≤ (0.5 ± 0.2) km for P/2017 S9 (PANSTARRS), recently redesignated 455P/PANSTARRS, and r <SUB> n </SUB> = (0.4 ± 0.1) km for P/2019 A3 (PANSTARRS). We identify evidence of activity in observations of 238P in 2021, and find similar inferred activity onset times and net initial mass-loss rates for 238P during perihelion approaches in 2010, 2016, and 2021. P/2016 J1-A and P/2016 J1-B are also found to be active in 2021 and 2022, making them collectively the tenth MBC confirmed to be recurrently active near perihelion and therefore likely to be exhibiting sublimation-driven activity. The nucleus of 313P is found to have colors of $g^{\prime} -r^{\prime} =0.52\pm 0.05$ and $r^{\prime} -i^{\prime} =0.22\pm 0.07$ , consistent with 313P being a Lixiaohua family member. We also report nondetections of P/2015 X6 (PANSTARRS), where we conclude that its current nucleus size is likely below our detection limits (r <SUB> n </SUB> ≲ 0.3 km). Lastly, we find that of 17 MBCs or candidate MBCs for which nucleus sizes (or inferred parent body sizes) have been estimated, &gt;80% have r <SUB> n </SUB> ≤ 1.0 km, pointing to an apparent physical preference toward small MBCs, where we suggest that Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack spin-up may play a significant role in triggering and/or facilitating MBC activity.","A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a supermassive black hole disrupts a nearby passing star by tidal forces. The subsequent fallback accretion of the stellar debris results in a luminous transient outburst. Modeling the light curve of such an event may reveal important information, for example the mass of the central black hole. This paper presents the TiDE software based on semi-analytic modeling of TDEs. This object-oriented code contains different models for the accretion rate and the fallback timescale ${t}_{\min }$ . We compare the resulting accretion rates to each other and with hydrodynamically simulated ones and find convincing agreement for full disruptions. We present a set of parameters estimated with TiDE for the well-observed TDE candidate AT2019qiz, and compare our results with those given by the MOSFiT code. Most of the parameters are in reasonable agreement, except for the mass and the radiative efficiency of the black hole, both of which depend heavily on the adopted fallback accretion rate.","Magnetars are a special subset of the isolated neutron star family, with X-ray and radio emission mainly powered by the decay of their immense magnetic fields. Many attributes of magnetars remain poorly understood: spin-down glitches or the sudden reductions in the star's angular momentum, radio bursts reminiscent of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) and transient pulsed radio emission lasting months to years. Here we unveil the detection of a large spin-down glitch event (fractional change in spin frequency ∣Δ ν /ν ∣=5 .8<SUB>−1.6</SUB><SUP>+2.6</SUP>×1 0<SUP>−6</SUP> ) from the magnetar SGR 1935+2154 on 5 October 2020 (±1 day). We find no change to the source-persistent surface thermal or magnetospheric X-ray behaviour, nor is there evidence of strong X-ray bursting activity. Yet, in the subsequent days, the magnetar emitted three FRB-like radio bursts followed by a month-long episode of pulsed radio emission. Given the rarity of spin-down glitches and radio signals from magnetars, their approximate synchronicity suggests an association, providing pivotal clues to their origin and triggering mechanisms with ramifications to the broader magnetar and FRB populations. We postulate that impulsive crustal plasma shedding close to the magnetic pole generates a wind that combs out magnetic field lines, rapidly reducing the star's angular momentum while temporarily altering the magnetospheric field geometry to permit the pair creation needed to precipitate radio emission.","Supernova light curves are dominated at early time, hours to days, by photons escaping from the expanding shock heated envelope. We provide a simple analytic description of the time dependent luminosity, L, and color temperature, T<SUB>col</SUB>, for explosions of red supergiants (with convective polytropic envelopes), valid up to H recombination (T ≈ 0.7 eV). The analytic description interpolates between existing expressions valid at different (planar then spherical) stages of the expansion, and is calibrated against numerical hydrodynamic diffusion calculations for a wide range of progenitor parameters (mass, radius, core/envelope mass and radius ratios, metalicity), and explosion energies. The numerically derived L and T<SUB>col</SUB> are described by the analytic expressions with $10{{\%}}$ and $5{{\%}}$ accuracy respectively. T<SUB>col</SUB> is inferred from the hydrodynamic profiles using frequency independent opacity, based on tables we constructed for this purpose (and will be made publicly available) including bound-bound and bound-free contributions. In an accompanying paper (Paper II) we show, using a large set of multi-group photon diffusion calculations, that the spectral energy distribution is well described by a Planck spectrum with T = T<SUB>col</SUB>, except at UV frequencies, where the flux can be significantly suppressed due to strong line absorption. We defer the full discussion of the multi-group results to paper II, but provide here for completeness an analytic description also of the UV suppression. Our analytic results are a useful tool for inferring progenitor properties, explosion velocity, and also relative extinction based on early multi-band shock cooling observations of supernovae.","A wind-driven model is a new framework to model observational properties of transients that are powered by continuous outflow from a central system. While it has been applied to Fast Blue Optical Transients (FBOTs), the applicability has been limited to post-peak behaviours due to the steady-state assumptions; non-steady-state physics, e.g., expanding outflow, is important to model the initial rising phase. In this paper, we construct a time-dependent wind-driven model, which can take into account the expanding outflow and the time evolution of the outflow rate. We apply the model to a sample of well-observed FBOTs. FBOTs require high outflow rates (~30 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) and fast velocity (~0.2 - 0.3c), with the typical ejecta mass and energy budget of ~0.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and ~10<SUP>52</SUP> erg, respectively. The energetic outflow supports the idea that the central engine of FBOTs may be related to a relativistic object, e.g.&lt;?del del-text="",""?&gt; a black hole. The initial photospheric temperature is 10<SUP>5 - 6</SUP> K, which suggests that FBOTs will show UV or X-ray flash similar to supernova shock breakouts. We discuss future prospects of surveys and follow-up observations of FBOTs in the UV bands. FBOTs are brighter in the UV bands than in the optical bands, and the timescale is a bit longer than in optical wavelengths. We suggest that UV telescopes with a wide field of view can play a key role in discovering FBOTs and characterizing their natures.","PBC J2333.9-2343 is a giant radio galaxy at z = 0.047 with a bright central core associated to a blazar nucleus. If the nuclear blazar jet is a new phase of the jet activity, then the small orientation angle suggest a dramatic change of the jet direction. We present observations obtained between September 2018 and January 2019 (cadence larger than three days) with Effeslberg, SMARTS-1.3m, ZTF, ATLAS, Swift, and Fermi-LAT, and between April-July 2019 (daily cadence) with SMARTS-1.3m and ATLAS. Large (&gt;2 ×) flux increases are observed on timescales shorter than a month, which are interpreted as flaring events. The cross correlation between the SMARTS-1.3m monitoring in the NIR and optical shows that these data do not show significant time lag within the measured errors. A comparison of the optical variability properties between non-blazars and blazars AGN shows that PBC J2333.9-2343 has properties more comparable to the latter. The SED of the nucleus shows two peaks, that were fitted with a one zone leptonic model. Our data and modelling shows that the high energy peak is dominated by External Compton from the dusty torus with mild contribution from Inverse Compton from the jet. The derived jet angle of 3 degrees is also typical of a blazar. Therefore, we confirm the presence of a blazar-like core in the center of this giant radio galaxy, likely a Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar with peculiar properties.","In 1181 AD, Chinese and Japanese observers reported an unmoving bright 'Guest Star' in the constellation Chuanshe, visible for 185 days. In 2013, D. Patchick discovered what turned out to be a unique nebula surrounding a unique star, with the structure named 'Pa 30', while subsequent workers made connections to mergers of white dwarfs, to the supernova subclass of low-luminosity Type Iax, and to the 1181 transient. Here, I provide a wide range of new observational evidence: First, detailed analysis of the original Chinese and Japanese reports places the 'Guest Star' of 1181 into a small region with the only interesting source being Pa 30. Second, the ancient records confidently place the peak magnitude as 0.0&gt;V<SUB>peak</SUB>&gt;-1.4, and hence peak absolute magnitude -14.5 &gt;M<SUB>V, peak</SUB>&gt;-16.0 mag. Third, the Pa 30 central star is fading from B=14.9 in 1889, to B=16.20 in 1950, to B=16.58 in 2022. Fourth, recent light curves show typical variability with full-amplitude of 0.24 mag on time-scales of one day and longer, critically with no coherent modulations for periods from 0.00046-10 days to strict limits. Fifth, the spectral energy distribution from the far-infrared to the ultraviolet is a nearly-perfect power-law with F<SUB>ν</SUB>∝ν<SUP>0.99 ± 0.07</SUP>, observed luminosity 128±24 L<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and absolute magnitude M<SUB>V</SUB>=+1.07. I collect my new evidences with literature results to make a confident case to connect the East-Asian observations to a supernova, then to Pa 30, then to a low-luminosity Type Iax SN, then to the only possible explosion mechanism as a merger between CO and ONe white dwarfs.","We present results of X-ray spectral and time-domain variability analyses of four faint, 'quiescent' blazars from the Swift-BAT 105-month catalogue. We use observations from a recent, 5-month long NICER campaign, as well as archival BAT data. Variations in the 0.3-2 keV flux are detected on minute, ~weekly, and monthly time-scales, but we find that the fractional variability F<SUB>var</SUB> on these time-scales is &lt;25 per cent and decreases on longer time-scales, implying generally low-amplitude variability across all sources and showing very low variability on monthly time-scales ($F_{\rm var}\lesssim 13{{\ \rm per\ cent}}$), which is at odds with previous studies that show that blazars are highly variable in the X-rays on a wide range of time-scales. Moreover, we find that the flux variability on very short time-scales appears to be characterized by long periods of relative quiescence accompanied by occasional short bursts, against the relatively time-stationary nature of the variability of most other AGN light curves. Our analysis also shows that the broadband X-ray spectra (0.3-195 keV) of our sources can be described with different power-law models. As is the case with most blazars, we find that two sources (2MASS J09343014-1721215 and PKS 0312-770) are well-modelled with a simple power law, while the remaining two (1RXS J225146.9-320614 and PKS 2126-15) exhibit curvature in the form of a log-parabolic power law. We also find that, in addition to the continuum, PKS 2126-15 requires significant absorption at the soft X-rays (≲1 keV) to fully describe the observed curvature, possibly due to absorption from the intergalactic medium.","With the advent of large-scale photometric surveys of the sky, modern science witnesses the dawn of big data astronomy, where automatic handling and discovery are paramount. In this context, classification tasks are among the key capabilities a data reduction pipeline must possess in order to compile reliable data sets, to accomplish data processing with an efficiency level impossible to achieve by means of detailed processing and human intervention. The VISTA Variables of the Vía Láctea Survey, in the southern part of the Galactic disc, comprises multiepoch photometric data necessary for the potential discovery of variable objects, including eclipsing binary systems (EBs). In this study, we use a recently published catalogue of one hundred EBs, classified by fine-tuning theoretical models according to contact, detached, or semidetached classes belonging to the tile d040 of the VVV. We describe the method implemented to obtain a supervised machine-learning model, capable of classifying EBs using information extracted from the light curves of variable object candidates in the phase space from tile d078. We also discuss the efficiency of the models, the relative importance of the features and the future prospects to construct an extensive data base of EBs in the VVV survey."
